,,"Good hawker style food, great experience",4.0,,"Good food (by Singapore standards so great by international standards). Good experience to sit out side on a steer surrounded by sky scrapers. It’s like s street festival right in the centre of Manhattan.

Tip - go there after 7pm, that’s when they close the street and lay the tables outside"
,,Great cheap meals and atmosphere,4.0,,A great place to get all sorts of cheap meals. At night the street closes and everyone eating outside and cooking. Well worth visiting and great if on a budget.
,,Great Singapore Hawker center,5.0,,"Loads of options at this massive hawker center right in the heart of Singapore, everything on offer from the many satay offers on the side street, to Thai/Indian/Malay/Chinese and much much more inside the hawker center itself. A must try is the fried dumplings and beer ;)"
,,Terrific Flea Market,5.0,,What a great and fun place. There were lots of places to bargain for neat gift items. Everyone we met was more than welcoming. The only problem I encountered was the food vendors which resulted in my eating a ‘second’ lunch.
,,Great way to experience street food in Singapore,4.0,,"We were very lucky to come upon this market upon our arrival in the evening at our hotel (SO Sofitel) that happens to be next to the market! Upon going out to look at the area we just stepped out onto the satay market that was laid out onto the street with tables, chairs, a lot of people and noise, and the smells and food, unbelievable!
The street closes to traffic in the afternoon and the satay market is laid out and ready for the customers that come from all over town, on foot, by taxis. Inside the pavilion is a myriad of small kitchens offering all type of meals, inexpensive and very tasty, and one can also buy from another stall drinks, and beer. We had a meal there during the day and although we were confused by all that was on offer, eventually what we got was good and tasty. A great and inexpensive experience in Singapore, either day or night."
,,Local street food reference,3.0,,"Eventually went to Lau Pa Sat, which was recommended as an awesome street food scene.

I am a bit conflicted with the place I must say. It has a mix of locals and tourists, giving it a quite nice atmosphere.

Look for the stall with most customers around so you dont give wrong."
,,"Great atmosphere, satay under the stars",4.0,,"We came for dinner at this Hawker centre. It is on Boon Tat St which is right near the Singapore stock exchange and the street closes at night for dinner. The street is then transformed with tables and is full of satay stalls.

There are more stalls inside the historic structures with a large range of dishes as in any other hawker centre.

Some satay stalls had lots of reviews posted up and these seemed to be the ones attracting lots of tourists at one end of the street. Really you can’t go wrong trying other stalls which we did. Satay sticks started at 70c SGD each and we ordered sambal sting ray , roti and other delicious dishes.

Some stall holders are pushy in trying to get you to order seafood from them, just ignore them , though we were followed by one persistent fellow aiming to get our business, but he gave up when he saw we were only really interested in satay sticks and not seafood on this night.

It was fantastic to be eating under the stars with good friends. A real Singapore experience."
,,Best Hawker Market,5.0,,"This is by far my favourite hawker market. There are plenty of vendors to pick from, they have a whole outdoor section dedicated to satay dishes and plenty of tables inside so you can actually eat food the same time as your friends rather than someone sitting at a table. A must for Singapore!"
,,Hawker food,3.0,,"Lau Pa Sat is one of the more touristy hawker markets in Singapore due to its central location and heritage ambience. It has a large range of food options and like any touristy place, some options are better than others.

Locals also visit so it is a good idea to follow their lead and opt for stalls with large queues. Prices are generally quite cheap and you can eat well for $5-6. It gets very busy during the lunch rush 12-2pm so bear that in mind."
,,"SHIOK (meaning ""delicious"")",4.0,,"In Singapore, when I think of barbecue, there's only one place I know. Lau Pa Sat, also known as Telok Ayer Market, is a historical building located within the downtown core in the central area of Singapore. If you want to have a good and tasty barbecue, this is the place to be. As you enter the vicinity you can smell the aroma of the barbecue all over the place. The charcoal flavored and smokiness of the barbecue will make you hungry. We ordered peanut chicken satay and shrimp bbq. It's sweet, spicy, flavorful, slightly bitter, which I think is very essential. Smoky and savory in every bite. For the price and the taste, it's reasonable, enough for the palate to enjoy."
,,"Good selection, known for tourist",5.0,,"Its a great selection, lots of food selection.. The price not that expensive. Its open till late night.
Known as a tourist must visit culinary. Not really clean but not a big mess too. Easy to reach and easy to recognize..
A great hawker for first timer.."
,,Overrated,3.0,,"We went there on sunday afternoon and half of the corners werent open. Still lots of option for different cuisines. I tried indian food it was ok but not the best that i ate in Singapore. The place wasn’t clean at all and also prices were very high compared to quality of food.
For the ones who wants to see different types of asian food like lau pa sat , i highly recommend the food court of Marina Bay Sands.Prices were same with Lau Pa Sat but it is so much better and clean."
,,Good atmosphere,5.0,,Really enjoyed visiting and eating here during a recent trip to Singapore. The atmosphere is terrific and when I visited it was not overly crowded. You cane either eat in the building which is a lovely old restored building or outside in the street near the satay sellers who appear at night. And the best way to get here is catching the train to Raffles City MRT station. There are signs showing you where tio go so it is easy to find.
,,Best Hawker Center I’ve visited,5.0,,"Why?
- Open and airy, not dark and dingy
- Large number of seats per stall, so no struggle finding a place to sit
- Wide variety of stalls including Thai, Indian, Vietnamese, Japanese and even Italian offerings as well as lots of Chinese and Singaporean choices
- A large, friendly crowd of locals gave the place a bustling vibe, even on a Tuesday night.
- Satays.

Recommended."
,,Totally worth a visit,5.0,,A huge hawkers center with just the best food and really well priced. Sit outside and soak in the atmosphere and the smell of the Satays!! This in itself is an experience! A must is the veggie spring rolls that are made in front of you and of course the satay sticks. Loved it here!
,,60th birthday meal,5.0,,"Hawker food at its best. Having grown up in Singapore smart casual and western food was not what I wanted on my special birthday. Ate at 7/8 The Best Satay, and they certainly knocked adjacent Super Satay at 6 into the shade BUT amount of meat was down on when we came here 3 years ago so perhaps Best Satay 7/8 is getting complacent. I know they read TripAdvisor so I hope they take note"
,,Tourist bait,2.0,,Wasn't a fan. Too touristy for me. Overpriced and not as tasty. There's a better hawker closer by (5min walk) that feels more like singapore and has yummy food. Amoy food court or market st food court has food for around 3 to 4 dollars with authentic tastes
,,Good street food,4.0,,"Visited in the evening, the street is shut off from vehicles. It does get busy but lots of people coming and going, so tables not a problem, the satay is lovely and so cheap about 70 cents a stick, you can order from the vendors who come up to you with menus and others for Tiger beer. We ordered, rice and garlic nan as well. Not a restaurant but good to see and feel part of the local community."
,,Amazing street food.,5.0,,"Amazing street food for the best price/quality in Singapore. Can be very busy at lunch. Chinese, Japanese, Indian of the highest quality."
,,"Locals or tourist, Lau Pa Sat offers great city priced hawker fair",4.0,,"During the day time most of the stalls inside the Lau Pa Sat (meaning Old Market) are open and offer a wide variety of local foods such as Indian banana leaf curry, chicken rice, Vietnamese pho and fishball noodles (prices are between $5-10 per meal). It's not the cheapest hawker centre but not as expensive as the office aircond food courts either.
In the evenings (7pm onwards) the small street beside Lau Pa Sat, Boon Tat St, is closed off to make way for the satay stalls and outdoor seating. Most of the Satay stalls are pretty similar in terms of value and standard. You can get a combination of chicken, mutton, beef and seafood satay with an estimated cost of $10-20 per pax.
For tourist Lau Pa Sat is definitely worth a visit."
,,vegetarian food @ shree Ganga stall in Lau Pa Sat,5.0,,"It can sometimes be hard to find vegetarian options in hawker centres, but this is by far an outstanding place to eat if you are wanting great vegetarian street food at Lau Pa Sat, food is fresh, hot and tasty, I ate here twice and will gladly come back again and again ! Always busy so you will need to wait a little as food is cooked fresh to order, I had the butter paneer masala dosa and Adai dosa both amazing !!!

Thankyou Shree Ganga"
,,Close to Merlion,5.0,,"There are numerous bars and restaurants in the areas adjacent to the Merlion but a short walk to Lau Pa Sat for street food is my preferred choice for a quick meal.
Featured in one scene in the Crazy Rich Asians movie, it is one of the many hawker centers that Singapore is famous for. The selection is huge so I recommend going in a group and ordering and sharing several types of food. My personal favorites are Hokkien Mee and chicken satay washed down with Tiger beer!"
,,100% Asian Full Experience,5.0,,"I loved this place: is an ancient Victorian Building where you can find different stand, which, every of them is specialised in something.
Noodle, meet, fish, Indian food, Thai, Dumpling, Duck.. you can find whatever you want, and you and your friend can taste different things and share a table. Food is the National Sport in Singapore, locals will also highly recommend this place"
,,Satay Power Stall 6,5.0,,Been here alot of times the satay never dissapoint me . Their mutton satay and gravy is so delicious award winning satay
,,Satay Street,5.0,,"Best satay in the world, have tried Satay in many places since I first came here but nowhere comes close to the atmosphere, smell and taste"
,,Possibly THE best place for food,4.0,,"On a recent family visit to Singapore, it was decided of course we would visit the hakwer centres. What they offer is amazing Asian food at very affordable prices. They are simple but impressive. They also have a great atmosphere with tourists and locals mixing. La Pau Sat was the one closest located to where we were staying and it is incredible.

There is such an array of Asian food and delicacies, it is uip to you what you choose. We visited for dinner 3 times during our stay, such was the food. I had curry one evening, chilli chicken rice another and char sui pork finally. Superb.There are also plenty of bakeries and dessert places for a sweet treat. A MUST visit for food and just to sample Singapore life."
,,nice to chat and eat food !,5.0,,lovely place in the center. a lot of food choices to pick from. not to expensive also. i went here twice and it was never to crowded.
,,Full of office workers,2.0,,"The place is right in business district. If you are there during work day lunch hour, getting a table is a nightmare. The place will be full of people who work around the area."
,,Hawker Center,4.0,,"Had food 3 times - break fast, lunch and dinner there. Variety of food options, mainly Indian and Chinese. This caters to mainly the office workers of financial district. Took some pics there as this place was an old fish market built in Victorian architecture style now turned into hawker center/food court."
,,Unfriendly and got taken for...,1.0,,"Always heard main things to do in Singapore is go to thw Hawker stands... So looked so foward to visiting a few. Lao Pa Sat is always mention so came for lunch... Firat thing that gor me rhinking was it was located right in the middle of financial district in a new clean looking terminal /building. That was all that was good. Arrived at 11:30 so not busy at all yet. Firat counter got taken for. May ne my fault for acting like a tourist by asking how many can I choose, and thwn asking how much. Something for 4$at Maxwell was $8.50..Then at another stand lady acted like was bothering her by getting something.. Blurtwd out amount and just took money and turn around and left... Food was subpar also. Not good at all.

Maxwell is waaaaay better and so are all the food courts in the malls... So many places for food, my bad for going so far and acting like a tourist. Bad taste in my mouth on last day in Singapore..."
,,Great Hawker Centre,5.0,,I visited 4 Hawker centres. Tekka centre China town Maxwell and this one. This was by far the best. Much cleaner a lot more choice and much better quality than the others.
,,Ok...but Vivio City Hawkers Market is better.,3.0,,"Food was good, but we paid more than we were expecting for a Hawkers Market. $35 for 25 bite size satays. A fun way to eat though. Had a better night at the Vivio City Hawkers Market. Try the tapenyaki there. It was great, theatrical (they cook it on a big grill in front of you) & a really good price."
,,One of the highlights of our trip,5.0,,"We learned on the Hop On Hop Off that people from Singapore eat out sometimes three times a day. And I can understand why. This place had every type of cuisine you can think of - it was so hard to choose - we had to come back twice!

Very clean - I was kind of surprised by the lack of napkins - and I learned that's actually a thing - you are supposed to bring your own. Not sure I understand why but... bring your own."
,,Central Hawker!,4.0,,"We love hawker food and attended midday Monday. Very busy with workers given its CBD location. Plenty of choices, relatively clean, great prices."
,,Enjoying dinner,5.0,,"Singapore is well-known for its street food, and by far this is the best place to enjoy traditional food. Located in the heart of the business district of Telok Ayer, this National monument is a real gem. It's an old market with a nice little clock-tower and in the afternoon, the whole street becomes filled with tables and guests enjoying the famous Singapore satay. It's also highly recommended to try the giant crabs in brown chili sauce. A great place with great food in a great atmosphere."
,,Lau Pa Sat,3.0,,"Historic food market frequented by office workers and tourists. The building has an interesting history (see Wikipedia), go for Satay street but overall better (and cheaper) food can be found in other Hawkers e.g old airport road."
,,We went out of our way and wish we hadn't really,3.0,,"We were told by friends that we absolutely must go here. Well it was just a pavillion with street food. We tried food at a couple of stalls and were underwhelmed. It is ok for cheap eats, but don't go out of your way if you have a food hall that is closer. Personally I think the Chinatown hawker stalls are the best in Singapore."
,,Best satay around,5.0,,"I am a huge satay fan and of the many places I’ve tried it in Singapore, Satay Stall 7&8 at Lau Pa Sat is by far my favorite. The marinade is great, the meat is well cooked and not too fatty and the peanut sauce is the best I have found - and the closest to what I remember as a kid growing up in Singapore. There are plenty of other good choices here from dim sum to seafood, but the satay is the star, so be sure to go after 7 once the street is closed and the tables are set up in front of Satay Stall 7&8!"
,,Food,4.0,,"Was recommended this area by one of our tour guides. We had seen it from the tourist bus. Wow what a place multiple foods, had the satay sticks ,beer and veggie rice. Small point , have smaller bills , each item made at different places, pay separately .
Lovely ambience great food. Price very reasonable compared to most other areas in Singapore."
,,Amazing street food,4.0,,"This place is amazing. So much to offer and with such a wide range of dishes to suit both meat eaters and vegetarians, the food hall provides authentic local dishes that have to be tried!

From pig organ soup to vegetarian curry, desserts to Western dishes, Lau Pa Sat has tons of options.

I had a classic spicy chicken jalfrezi dish with rice, two sides and naan all for 8 SGD (the Executive Meal) which I highly recommend."
,,Iconic Food Court,5.0,,"The Lau Pa Sat is perhaps the most iconic food court in Singapore. It is located in the heart of the CBD area, so its very popular with office goers. You'll find all kinds of food here."
,,Great Experience,5.0,,We went at sunset when they closed a street for the grilled meat with satay sauce. The hawker centre was massive and there was a wide variety of cuisines to chose from. We decided to stay outside and have satay sticks and beer. We were pestered a fair bit but the satay was amazing. The area can get quite smoky from the bbq's but it also sets up the atmosphere of great food smells and a lively street vibe.
,,Best Satay,5.0,,"A must visit in the evening to go to satay street. Amazing food. Went numerous times. Had satay from stalls 6,7,8 and all good. You do get pestered though which is a pain but food incredible. Try the basil chicken as well. Amazing. Loved this place and really miss the food"
,,Definitely a good spot to find good food,5.0,,"This a great spot to find good and cheap food.

Make sure you have cash and if decide to eat Chilly Crab ask 1st the weight and how much it will cost you to don’t get surprise with price!

We had an amazing fried noodles and fried rice!"
,,A very huge hawker center,4.0,,"This is a hawker center which opens day and night. It caters to both local office people form the surrounding business district and tourists. It is huge and has lots of choices, so be prepared to walk around and 'hunt' for the food that you want to try. If you come after 7pm, the road beside is closed up and the satay vendors would start their business.

The building has got a very nice architecture and the place is very well maintained and clean.

In the evening, the atmosphere here is very lively due to the activities of the busy satay vendors."
,,Great place to eat,5.0,,"Wonderful food, we had breakfast and dinner here. The food was fantastic, flavoursome and very cheaply priced. The atmosphere is fantastic, sharing tables with the locals. The oldest hawker Centre in Singapore and really worth going enjoying the fabulous food."
,,One of the best food centres,5.0,,"Tried a lot of food centres while in Singapore and this was definitely one of the best - went around lunchtime, really great choice of food, stall holders seemed quite aware of dietary requirements if you asked them about ingredients. Nice pavilion to have a meal in."
,,Sophisticated but not so hygienic Street Food!,3.0,,"Lau Pa Sat is a food market place that is somewhere between sophisticated foodcourts and hawkers. Long ago singapore hawkers were removed and places like lau pa sat are a better version of their replacement. variety of local food place, boasts of all types of cuisines and pocket friendly food options for both veggies and non veggies. This specific place is situated in the heart of the city between the complete office area of raffles business center. So its a hot spot for lunch and dinners for corporate working in that area. for veg food folks, you do have Delhi cuisine, and couple of dosa and parantha places to try out."
,,Some much choice,4.0,,"So much food choice, very vibrant atmosphere satay street it packed of locals everyday. All food cooked and prepares infront of you. Very cheap you could easily eat out for less than £7 per head including drink. Portions are huge"
,,A great cultural experience,4.0,,"We came here to check out this well-known hawker centre and really enjoyed the food on offer. The satay sticks are an ABSOLUTE must and were amazing and very cheap. Buy it from ""Best Satay 7&8"" !! All of them say they have the best satay but these guys are the pick!"
,,Around the world...,5.0,,"it is always a delight to eat at the most global center in the world. lunch on weekdays here is chaos as you share the experience with the corporate yuppies of the CBD, they “chop” or reserve their seats with tissues, namecards or umbrellas. it is such an experience - a local vibe! in the eve, road in Boon Tat is closed for vehicular access and all the satay shops will lay their foldable tables for the start of the crowd at 6-7 pm. From chicken wings grilled to seafood, local dishes - chicken rice and satay. everything is delicious.

Budget : sgd 80
Pax : 4
Dishes : Grilled prawns, satays, Indian prata, Saba Fish, Grilled chicken, tofu and spicy stingray"
,,Best Satay in Singapore,4.0,,If you want to try hawker street food go to Lau Pa Sat. There are many satay restaurants and those were the best we tried in Singapore. Best time to visit is the late evening or night.
,,Great,5.0,,Great - went x2 while in the City - lots of options - price friendly - all food we had was great. Put this on on the to visit list. Close to MRT.
,,Satay,4.0,,"One of the best Satay you can have in Singapore at least authentic local food ,visited here at night time"
,,Take No 8 it is the best,5.0,,"I always go to Lau Pa Sat and have the food from stall No. 8, it is really the best one! You sit on the plastic chair having good food, a cold beer and enjoy the night."
,,Best vegetarian dumpling,5.0,,"I tried the vegetarian dumpling from the stall ""handmade dumpling"" and they were very very good. I've been disappointed many times in different food court but those ones worth it. The old guy who is making them is very lovely and take care of you.
Highly recommend his stall !"
,,Local eating at Lau Pa Sat,3.0,,"It's not a regular go-to place for locals because the food there is pretty overpriced as compared to other hawker centers, definitely a very touristic place. The food is decent and there's a wide variety, it's pretty cheap compared to the cafes/restaurants in Singapore, but expensive relative to other hawker centers though. It's also a lot cleaner than most hawkers because they have an 'image' to keep up with. That being said, I'd not recommend this place unless you're in the area."
,,A food court with character.,5.0,,"The building was lovely to look up at the ornate ceilings. It was a very clean food court ( except the toilet, avoid if you can) and there was something for everyone. As we were going to the light show at gardens by the bay we were too early for Satay st so I can’t comment on that."
,,worst hawker center experince,1.0,,"45 years in Singapore & this is the 1 of the worst I ever experienced right after Newton circle hawker.
- food are over rated
- non- authentic taste
- over prince
- served under cooked satay (& over prince btw)

There are hundreds of better hawker in Singapore."
,,COMBINATION OF HISTORY AND FOOD,4.0,,"If you haven't been, now is the time to have lunch or dinner here. It's a great location for the financial district workers and tourists visiting Marina Bay. Good variety of foods at reasonable prices. Neat and organized."
,,"Dead Crab Served by #67-68, Ming Yen Restaurant 「銘雁鐵板燒烤海鮮」",1.0,,"I brought a visitor from Kunming to experience the SG ‘hawker’ food @ historical site, Lau Pa Sat on 16 Nov 2017. We were approached by a friendly lady “aunty” for seafood ‘tze char’ experience. She was nice to usher us to the stall #67-68, Ming Yen Restaurant 「銘雁鐵板燒烤海鮮」

We ordered the recommended signature dish ‘black pepper crab’, sambal kang kong (water spinach) & salted egg prawn (all items were served in a small portion: total food bill @ sgd74) and a jug of tiger beer (sgd20) ordered separately from a drink vendor.

We were served a small ‘dead’ crab @ sgd45! Texture of crab meat were soft, mushy & watering.

I wish that the stall owner / cook can practise some basic business ethics here, especially stall is located at touristic site. It’s not only impact the Singapore tourism reputation risks, but failure in food hygiene & safety standard from the AVA perspective. Fortunately, we didn’t get serious food poisoning, but we both had diarrhoea 2hrs after dinner! It was indeed an unpleasant encounter, and certainly an embarrassment to my oversea visitor !"
,,Great Atmosphere,5.0,,Fun way to experience Hawker Style Food right in the middle of the city. In the evenings the aroma from the Satay Stalls alone will entice you. Satay Vendors hand out menus & vie for your order and tables are set up on the street when it closes to traffic after 6pm. Fun to watch & Great atmosphere!
,,Dinner alone at Lau Pa Sat,4.0,,"That night, I went to Gardens by the Bay until about 9pm and on the way back to the hotel, I decided to stopped at Lau Pa Sat for dinner.
I wanted to have sambal stingray and satay, so I guessed it should be a good place.
I walked around inside the beautiful pavilion and found this seafood shop (Boon Tat street) outside. Since I was alone so I just made it here easy for me.
I asked for a small portion of sambal stingray, oysters with garlic sauce. I also asked the shop to order beef & mutton satay for me.
For me, it was convenient that I didn't have to walk around and order stuff I wanted.
And the food was pretty good. I was satisfied with the bbq stingray. Oysters with garlic sauce were very good! Satay (beef & mutton) was average though, the peanut sauce could be better. But I didn't know which stall these satay were from.
I wanted to go back later for more choices of food but I didn't have time.
I think if I go back to Singapore I would like to try other food at Lau Pa Sat again."
,,Culturally experience Singapore,4.0,,Even if you are not hungry this is a must do if you want to dive into the culture of Singapore. Lots of authentic eats to choose from and lots of different cultures represented by the people there.
,,This is a Singaporean icon,5.0,,"This is a Singaporean icon. It's touristy, but a great place to get the tastes and smells of Singapore hawker food. Definitely try the Yong Tau Foo, Indian Chaat and Char Kway Tao. The Costa Rican place is also surprisingly good (if out of place)."
,,Eat in Pavilion not Street.,4.0,,"Lau Pa Sat Pavillon on its own is a good place to go for an evening, a good variety of food to choose from and good atmosphere. Don't bother with Boon Tat Satay Street outside (see my review on TA) it's really terrible,overpriced pushy staff and not great food. Stay in the Pavilion and enjoy the atmosphere,food friendly staff and the beautiful building."
,,A Good Place for your Tummy,4.0,,A lot of good food with a very reasonable placefrom local food to western food asian food .Do notmiss this place if you are a food lover
,,You want food? It is here - whatever you want...,4.0,,"Unbelievable selection of food at this Hawker Market. Whether you want to run with the basic satay sticks on the makeshift tables they set up on the street, or try some fisheye laksa inside, there is something for everyone.

Only reason this didn't get an excellent score was because there was some really loud really bad music from some band playing Octoberfest type music (in September). I'm sure it was meant to be fun, but it was just so crap it was laughable."
,,Good Variety of Food - Not Cheapest but Reasonably Prices - Tourists should Visit,4.0,,"Review by Dr Sim. Besides Newton Hawker Centre, tourists can visit Lau Pa Sat to taste the local food. In dialect, it means Old Market. Not air-conditioned. Good variety of food. Reasonably priced. Basic ambience. Self-Service. Go in the evening (after 6pm) where the satay stalls are temporarily set up on the street next to Lau Pa Sat. Nowadays you get other foreign food besides the local food. It makes the place more interesting. Not easy to find parking space. There is a MRT station nearby. Regards DrSim001"
,,Extremely over rated,1.0,,"Just arrived back from Lau Pa Sat Food Hall and "" satay street"", with the exception of the boiled rice the food that we had was below expectations. We had chicken satay from Best Satay, when they arrived they were cold and like bullets, the sauce was very well done.
We had batted small prawns and lemon chicken, what can I say except the chicken was tough and the lemon sauce was missing in action and the prawn we all batter and no taste.
We had a glass of beer and a coke and the bill was exactly Singapore dollars 50.
I will not be back.
Dunnydo"
,,Awesome,4.0,,"Lau pa sat,a quite big hawker centre,many kind or food stalls(many choice of food} and value of money,nice place to have lunch and dinner,overall was awesome"
,,Variety of low-cost food and local satay,5.0,,"This place is located in the centre of Central Business District, walking distance from Raffles MRT.
Wide choice of affordable meals from different cousine - local, Indian, Western. Halal options, Tiger beer, sugar cane drinks.
In a day time popular for office workers from nearby buildings, in the evening - many tourists have their supper here.
One dish will cost you $4-10.
Also, in the evening, you can enjoy satay, I'd recommend stall no.4 & 7.
Grilled sea food.
Also would recommed smoked chicken wings, good with Tiger beer."
,,Loved it!,5.0,,"Awesome hawker centre, probably the biggest of all we visited whilst in Singapore, so of course a great selection of food to choose from. Also out the back were a number of satay stalls which were delicious. Centre very clean and the food was great! Glad we came here!"
,,Interesting place,4.0,,It's probably the biggest and most well known hawker centre in Singapore. You have a huge variety of stands to pick your food from. Mostly local specialties with a few exceptions. There is food for all tastes! Nice idea to just sit down and share a table with strangers too. Two tips: they only accept cash and you need to buy your drinks from dedicated stands. Highly recommended to try at least once.
,,Overcrowded & Noisy,3.0,,"I had decided, after research, that my husband and I would go here for lunch while in Singapore. We found the place was so overcrowded, and the noise was overpowering for two people in their seventies. After wandering around, which was difficult due to the squash, having a look at what was available we decided to find somewhere else for lunch. I could possibly have found something to my liking, and we may have been able to find a table, but my husband didn't see anything he fancied and the heat and the noise was more than we were willing to endure. The architecture of the pavilion is worth a look but don't expect to be able to eat there."
,,A must-visit Hawker Center,5.0,,This hawker center is awesome. In the night they close off the street next to it and open a number of stalls where they sell satay. This goes on till about 12.30am. The food and location are both great. It is important to note that even though it says this place is open 24 hours on some websites almost all the shops are closed at night and the ones that are open have a very limited choice.
,,Like Satay? Then you want to visit Lau Pa Sat,5.0,,I visit Lau Pa Sat every trip to Singapore...this is a Hawkers Market. Sit outside and the hawkers will come to you along with the Tiger beer girls. This is cheap and cheerful good food. No need to over order as the food comes quickly and you can always order more.
,,My daily lunch place,5.0,,"This is where i have my food during office hours for past three years and for some one who is eating for so long,its not boring. My favourites here are thunder tea rice,oyster omlette,hokkien mee,laksha"
,,Simply an Outstanding Food Court!,5.0,,"This is one of the iconic places in Singapore having history of hosting traders and businessmen to facilitate trade. It was later converted to a food court and the heritage construction is still maintained.
The place has cuisines from across the Globe on offer! Right from Korean, Japanese, Cantonese, Singaporean, Malay, Thai, Indonesian, Indian, Mexican, Lebanese and other food options are available. The food court serves some very good meat delicasies.
There are lot of options for vegetarian lovers too.
Swaad - this place offers the best pure vegetarian Indian food.
There are a lot of other options too.
This place is a must visit for all food lovers out here!"
,,A little tired,3.0,,"Having accommodation just around the corner from here, we intended using Lau Pa Sat as our catch all lunch and dinner spot. We love the satay (outside stalls 7 and 8 are the best) complete with a large jug of beer (sufficient for three beers each at a total of $20), but did find other indoor food, while plentiful option-wise, really disappointing. I watched one vendor making a dish, then later reheating it pre serving. No wonder it was stodgy - rice noodles do not take kindly to being served other than just done. There is an interim hawker stall just down the road heading to Chinatown that we ended up preferring (though not all stalls are open on weekends and holidays). Satay remains outstanding at Lau Pa Sat (thus, my rating), but we won't be back for any other dishes in future."
,,Woah. Some of the below reviews are just so wrong. Why though?,4.0,,"Some review says this is the biggest food court in Singapore? No even slightly close. Another claims this is conveniently next to Orchard. Google Maps, the whole of Singapore and I would disagree. One complains there is no air-con, another of being harassed by stall owners. While not wrong in statement, wrong on so many levels of sentiment.

I'll try to clear it up.

In the middle of the financial district a few blocks back from the marina is Lau Pa Sat. The closest MRT is Raffles Place, exit I. That is the letter between H and J. Either way, every local will know and will lonely point you. They have to by law. Inside the olde pavillion is your regular hawker fair, although slightly more expensive than elsewhere - you see a high proportion of tourist customers, which could explain the prices, or maybe the location . Also because the real reason to go here is because the road is closed to traffic after 7pm as it becomes, as it affectionately known, 'Satay Street'. Kinda fun, mostly tourists and locals hosting business buddies. $20 jugs of Tiger beer, a sense of humour and not growing up wrapped in cotton wool should help you from feeling harassed. They are doing their job and won't bother you. What's up with people? Seriously. How do you get dressed in the morning? Life is so easy."
,,On the list.,3.0,,Gave this well known area a try.Featuring a wide range of food in the pavilion and street eating.Satay was the call but not the best I've had.prawns were very good though.Expensive beer.
,,Dinner,4.0,,A historic building with open concept dining where various food stalls sell local foods and drinks including beers. Outdoors are found many satay stalls and cooked food stalls that is very popular in the evenings .
,,Nice stop,4.0,,This place is a well converted old pavilion that provides a nice stop for some delicious food in the heart of the CBD so you are surrounded by many different high rise buildings. Options from all corners of Asia are available and it is reasonably priced.
,,Delicious food for all asia,4.0,,It's Singapore ´s oldest food court and has a lot of charme. I tested indian food that was delicious. It can be a bit tricky to find a place a lunch time
,,A quick stop for locals and tourists,3.0,,"The place is convenient for tourists to have a quick meal and then proceed to explore the places like Merlion Park and Fullerton Historical Gallery. I brought my friends early for a quick dinner and we had a walk to see the infrastructure around and wait to have pictures of the night view! In evening, there were few stores which are still open for business so if you want to have a Singapore style feast, I would suggest somewhere else!"
,,I don't recommend this at all.,2.0,,"The food is fine. But the meat is not fresh. And the kitchens look quite dirty. There is annoying salesperson running everywhere trying to take you to their shop. They wouldn't go away no matter what. And it's really hot because there's no air-conditioners, but there are stoves everywhere."
,,Great Satay!!,4.0,,"I ate here about 4-5 times over a recent 10 day stay in Singapore, good cheap food, a good place to eat satay and other local dishes, satay sticks are cooked the authentic way over coals. 10 sticks = $7, 1 stick = 1 mouthful ;), 1 x handle of Tiger beer = $5.50
Best to go after the sun sets as most of the tables are in the open.
I walked around the scoping out the food stalls before I chose one to purchase my food from. Satay stall '3/4' was excellent and was my go to place each time I ate here.
Lau Pa Sat is a good place to eat good cheap food, the vendors here are no where near as pushy and hassling as they are at Newton Circus and the place isn't packed full of tourists either.
Can't wait for my next trip to Singapore to eat here again."
,,Great Place for a Foodie,4.0,,"Lau Pa Sat is probably the biggest food court complex in Singapore. Located very conveniently close to Orchard Road, it is popular with locals as well as the tourist crowd. One can get a range of cuisines here at surprisingly very reasonable prices. Definitely a must visit place in Singapore."
,,You should go here FIRST so you can plan time to go back,5.0,,"I don't know why we waited to go here until later. We've eaten at many of the food courts in Singapore, but this is the biggest, which the widest range of food choices. I've got one who like Korean, one who likes Chicken Rice, another who wants anything soup, and another who wants chicken tikka with garlic naan. This place had something for every one and no one had to settle for something else. Unlike some other food courts, it's open on the sides so the hot air wafts in. But don't let that discourage you.
We went at noon on Sunday and it was not busy. Some stalls weren't open yet.
It was HOT.
easy mrt access
didn't use bathrooms so I don't know if they're on site.
Bring napkins."
,,Treasure house for foodies,4.0,,"Alok Ayer Market, Festival Market is by ,majority of Singaporeans known as La Pa Sat , official name given to octagonal building with a central clock tower .
It is located in the center of financial,commercial district of Singapore surrounded by hundreds of offices.
Octagonal building has 8 radial spokes joining at a central capola with a clock tower. The structure is built using using cast iron columns,arches and roof support imported from England. Central clock tower is open from below showing
4/5 bells ,statue of a boy holding a gong. After a gap of every 15 minutes statue of the boy become animated and ringing the bells.
8 Octagonal redials have open spaces full of hundreds of neatly arranged tables and chairs. Rest of the space is packed with hundreds of food stalls. The food stalls are self service type where you buy your food and take it to any of the tables . There are few restaurants as well with proper enclosures and seating served by waiters .
The food stalls and restaurants serve cuisines from gourmet meals to fast food of the countries around the world.
Generally Lou Pa Sat is quite,with the staff of food stalls and restaurants ,quietly going about their job. Come 1200 noon and suddenly the serene quality is changed by the hub hub and rushing around of hundreds of office goers who congregate there during their lunch break between 1200 noon and 2 PM .
Lou Pa Sat is a place where tourist gather as a place of attraction AND a place where they can have a choice of various types of cuisine . At same time it fulfills the lunch requirement providing fresh and hot meals.
It is unique and unforgettable experience watching Lou Pa Sat in full flow."
,,Not Good,1.0,,"Go somewhere else for the satay. The satay was bad. The meat was all fat and the vultures (touts) are annoying. There was a carrot cake and chicken rice stall there that is no too bad but all in, it was not worth the journey."
,,not worth it,2.0,,"Be very wary of eating here. lots of people i know have discovered bugs in their food, got bad indigestion after eating at these hawkers. that said, many office workers in the area eat here daily. The food isn't anything special either, so in my books not worth the risk or discomfort."
,,Nostalgic,5.0,,"The Satay section of this very old food market is only opened at night time - during the day it is yet another busy road in Singapore - the satays are to ""die for""- whilst the pavillion is open at night I think their main trade comes from workers dining there for lunch - large selection of food available- was able to
re-live my first experience of satay there"
,,Awesome food,4.0,,This is a must visit place in Singapore. Amazing variety and selection. Food options for vegeterians are plenty too.
,,Best Satays in Town,5.0,,Visit Lau Pa Sat every time we are in Singapore. The meals are delicious and cheap. Satays to die for. It is very crowded at night even when raining but you always manage to get a table. You know its good when the local eat there.
,,"Great food, always visit here.",5.0,,"Went again for the Satay, we always visit after 7pm when the Satay sellers spread onto the road and love the food and atmosphere.

Kids are getting bigger, ordered 100 sticks of Satay and we finished them all and still could have had move after. Great food"
,,A must do for food lovers!!,5.0,,This place is situated between sky scrapers. a whole centre of authentic food...best to go at night...grab a table outside and have a chilled beer with satay..stall no. 7 and 8 are the famous ones...but mostly all serve the same thing..i loved the whole expat vibe of this place...its a must do thing in singapore !!
,,Expensive corporate canteen,2.0,,"Nice architecture and a long history, recently restored: The perfect place for expatriates and tourists in quest of a sterilized foretaste of Singapore hawker centre culture. Lovers of cheap tasty authentic local food and heartland atmosphere will be disappointed."
,,Still great but not the same,4.0,,"The food is still great, and there is still the fun of Hawker but it feels a bit too ""food court"" now. Certainly still a great way to get an affordable meal in Singapore. Highlight is being outside at 6:30pm to watch the road closed and the mass movement by to set up tables on the street."
,,A Must Do Experience,4.0,,Singapore is renowned for its cuisine and there is no shortage of variety in this amazing city when it comes to places to eat. Street food is a special feature though and I reckon you can get the best of this experience right here at Lau Pa Sat. It has been done up and is a great fast-food experience with amazing variety under cover and the street satay vendors cannot be bypassed. The food is good quality and very reasonable and make sure you get a big Tiger beer to wash it all down. Closest MRT is Raffles Place and the route is well sign-posted.
,,Beware expensive market!!!,4.0,,"Excellent location & food - but don't order too much (as we did - 1. because can't eat it all & 2. costs a fortune!).
Satays ($82) were good as were the prawns - but the real treat was the chilli crab ($45 - 65 depending on size). Jug of Tiger $40! So an expensive night out"
,,Used to be better.,4.0,,"This place used to be better for food. After the recent renovation the food choices and tastes are no longer that good. The food is more expensive than before and there is nothing outstanding. The place is more comfortable since the renovation but nothing more...
If you intend to visit this place I would recommend you to come for dinner after 7pm when the road side is closed to allow an outdoor bbq/satay food to take place."
,,Delicious Satay,5.0,,"Great location, delicious Satay, tiger beer and noodles also great quick service. Always visit when in Singapore."
,,"""We found this place to late""",4.0,,"Unfortunately we found this place on our last day in Singapore around lunch time, we ate some great food and we will be going back on our next visit to Singapore, great place to eat with plenty of choice."
,,Stone's Throw from Sofitel,4.0,,"Picked the Sofitel hotel as Lau Pa Sat is right next door. Ran over and bought food to bring back for the kids. Got chicken rice, fish soup, some char siew bao and ha gow. The food is pricier than normal hawker centers. Mostly around $5+. They're known for their satay street which my son enjoyed last night. Good variety of stalls but noticed several closed stalls as well. Not sure if it was a weekday closure for a day off. Good selection but the food didn't knock my socks off."
,,Renovated Victorian Marketplace Now Premium Hawker Centre,3.0,,"I liked Lau Pa Sat when I first arrived in Singapore in early 2011. Then it closed two years for renovations, cleaner tables and chairs, and higher prices. Yes, you can still get a reasonable and tasty meal here. I say average because there are numerous hawker centres all over Singapore that I would rate a FIVE for their category of foods and service, because what you want in a hawker centre is cheap, flavorful, big portioned food! Granted LPS is near the financial hub and prices are higher, but I would not queue for a meal there when cheaper hawkers centres are all over. I have patronised it with friends and visitors at least 20 times in six years and think it dropped from a 4 to a 3 but others disagree with me because it is part of Singapore heritage, not because the food is better than other hawker places. It is worth a visit to take photos of its Victorian style metal work."
,,OK Food Centre,3.0,,Its good that the hawker stalls have been cleaned up and put into a central hawker centre like this- however I think that taste has suffered for it. My recollections of street dining in Singapore years ago were of very tasty hot food cooked in the lanes and alleyways at night so maybe this has been over sanitised?
,,24hours,4.0,,*plenty of food options *the place is huge so getting a table is a bit challenging *we came back at around 3am and we found some stalls that are still open. My friends continued drinking. Yes they still sell beer😊 *Value for money is👌👌👌
,,Excellent Food Court,5.0,,"It is a sizable hawker food with plenty of variety to choose from. Especially good to try the local foods as it is of Singapore 'taste'. Many good food such as Chicken Rice, Satay, Hokkien Mee, Malay food , Indian food, etc"
,,Popular hawker centre,4.0,,Great variety of food available in this hawker. Visited on a weekday during the lunch hour so it was very crowded and hard to find seats. Should visit if you are looking for a place to eat when you're in the area.
,,Food court,2.0,,"My husband and I were disappointed with the food here not at all what we expected after reading the reviews , we have been to better hawker food places than that."
,,Excellent food court,5.0,,"One of the really good hawker centres in Singapore. Huge range of food, very clean and efficient spot. Food is delicious and expected low prices. Nice central location."
,,Local at its best,5.0,,If you are trying to look for a great place and become a Singapore Foodie this is the place to be! Authentic Singapore food and a nice ambiance for friends and tourist who wants the feels and vibe of the red dot.
,,Nice local experience,4.0,,This is a very good place to try various types of Asian food in a real atmosphere. This is where people that work in this area go for a quick lunch.
,,"Great food, lots of locals",4.0,,"Great local food in a charming 8 arm pavilion, all done with that Singapore style. The laksa was very good, and the char kwey teow was also very good. There are lots of locals, and there are lots of choices, so be prepared to have to wait awhile to find a vacant table, and with the lots of choices be prepared to be dumbstruck about what to have.
Good cheap local eats, great atmosphere"
,,Makan,4.0,,A good place to go in the evening when they close a portion of a street and set up satay stalls for us to dine under the stars
,,Amazing Selection of Asian Delights,4.0,,"Wowee! An amazingly popular lunch spot near the Marina Bay Financial Centre. Get here before 12 on if you want to find a table otherwise you take your chance with the hundreds of other hungry patrons. Excellent range of Singapore food specials and other countries across the globe. Cheap, cheerful and great fun and value."
,,Convenient and atmospheric,4.0,,"Staying at a hotel next door, Lau Pa Sat was great to have nearby for an easy meal, in a lovely building. Because of it's excellent location, you get the feeling that some of the vendors rest on their laurels food-wise - given that the tourist and business crowds will come anyway. If you're looking for better food at better prices, try some of the hawker market's at nearby Chinatown."
,,Good for dinnner,5.0,,Place with many kinds of food. One the most popular is satay - pieces of meat on the stick with peanut sauce. Price is 7 $. In the evening this place is full of people. I think this is a good place to go.
,,Great Satay,5.0,,"A great Hawker experience!

There is a satay street not far from the pavilion. The pavilion itself is full of delicious cheap dishes. For S$38 we got a ""couples"" order of satay: 10 beef, 10 chicken, and 10 prawns... delicious!

Don't forget to get a pitcher of beer for S$20. The prawns are messy to eat so be sure to bring some tissue napkins, but if you forget you can buy some for S$2 on the spot.

A great hangout spot, lots of locals and close to the city center."
,,Best hawker place,5.0,,"Lau pa sat is my first choice when asked which hawker I love the most. Food tastes great, many choices too! Price is really affordable. Ambiance is good too. Even with lots of people, it doesn't feel crowded. Will always love the laksa on the restaurant that serves chicken rice too."
,,AWESOME AWESOME food,5.0,,Fantastic food. The vegetarian place was fantastic. I thought this was better than Newton's this time. The vegetarian place had a pan asian twist!
,,Safe and good street food,4.0,,"At the recommendation of a colleague, I tried the satay stalks that se up in Cross Street in the evening. I came back to the first I saw - Rahim Satay. I had a mix of prawn, chicken, lamb and beef, which were cooked well, tender, and accompanied by the usual delicious peanut sauce, all for S$20.50. Cold Tiger beer is also available."
,,Satay,4.0,,"The Lau Pa Sat hawkers market was a must do on our short stay in Singapore. We stayed in Chinatown and the walk to Lau Pa Sat was about a 2km walk.
You can choose from the established indoor shops at the market or the outdoor satay Carts.
The satay hawkers quickly spot you and will approach you with their menu as an alternative to the established premises.
Cooking at the satay carts is not permitted till 6.30 pm but you can enjoy a Tiger beer while you wait.
Don't wait too long to get there as the place gets busy quickly. A great place to enjoy the warm nights of Singapore."
,,Best food court,5.0,,Best and most affordable food court in Singapore. So many different types of food to eat. Multiple cuisines and varieties available.
,,Many food stalls and also cheap,4.0,,"It is a nice place with several dozen of different food stalls. Singaporean, Chinese, Indian, Japanese, Vietnamese and even Turkish food stalls with nice dessert outlets. The prices are very cheap as well."
,,Street Food with Character!,4.0,,"Recommended Southeast Asian-style street food in the middle of Singapore. The food is great (try ""Best Satay No. 7 or 8""). Some seating is outside on a one-way street (closed off after hours). Beer is available. Once seated, many vendors will come to you and show you menus -- highly recommended experience. Suggestion: bring your own tissues, as tables do not have any."
,,Great for dinner,4.0,,There is always a buzz around Hawker Centres and this is no exception especially if you arrive after 6pm when the street is set with tables and chairs for the cooking of satay. What great value Hawker food is.
,,Food heaven,5.0,,What a place..sample all of Singapore's signature dishes at the best prices. Lovely architecture as well with a church bell that rings intermittently.
,,Street stuff at its best,5.0,,"Must experience this , its like a food court of street foods. Loved the feel the way there is order in the chaos and some how it all seems to come together. giving it an amazing eating experience. Wee hours of night are good too."
,,History and satay in one place,4.0,,"Thousands of feet walk through this venue every day, most oblivious to the historical significance of this hawker centre. It's not just a venue for the working crowd by day and delicious satay by night. The structure is one of the oldest evidence of a marketplace in Singapore from the early colonial period.

There are very few places in Singapore where we could find Victorian cast-iron elements and bronze bells with a jacquemart crafted in Europe. It also has an iconic clock tower and distinctive high-ceilinged octagonal structure with eight radial passageways.

Now to the late night satay. One of the lanes was transformed into a pedestrian walkway and open-air seating dotted by a line of satay stalls. We were informed that they generally open around 7pm and operate till 12am. The rest of the hawker centre is opened in the day. The crowd had thinned as the night grew long.

There were many stalls to patronage and everyone has their favorites or recommendations. We finally decided on Stall 8 for a taste test of its mutton and tripe. The mutton were skiner slivers of meat but it was well marinated with sweet and charred flavors. The larger portions of tripe was equally charred with a chewy texture. We enjoyed a view of history while biting on our satays."
,,Just average food with nice view,3.0,,"An overpriced average quality food you can see everywhere in Singapore with a little too diluted beer with affordable price.
Been there few times and the quality of food differs a lot from stall by stall. Definitely would not recommend someone to go on a rainy day.
As the place has its unique view, sitting at the side of the forest of buildings and enjoy the ambience, it is worth visiting at least once.
Had a little difficulty communicating with the staffs. Going there with local or Chinese speaking person would not cause you any problem."
,,The wrong night?,3.0,,"We arrived here between 9-10p on a Friday night, it wasn't packed but still a number of people sitting around eating and having drinks. Went to one stall and lined up to get a meal only to be told that my first choice had sold out, second choice sold out, and by the time was told the third choice had also sold out, decided to walk. The Vietnamese stall had also sold out of food and only had soup left. As a place that is supposedly open until 3-4am, was really surprised that these places had sold out by 10pm. Was looking forward to visiting here, certainly lots of different cuisine (Indian, Japanese, Vietnamese, Chinese, Thai, Malaysian, Costa Rican and more), but really disappointed that I couldn't get what I wanted."
,,Great hawker centre,4.0,,Great hawker centre...lots of options very well priced...the suburban ones were cheaper but this is central and convenient... Satay street is next door but the indoor options are better... Good spot...
,,Amazing selection of |Food,5.0,,"We ate here on a few occasions both lunch and dinner, it has a great selection of foods from all around the world at very reasonable prices."
,,loved Lau Pat Sat,5.0,,We went to Lau Pat Sat 3 x during our stay in Singapore. We stayed at the Westin so it's virtually a 2 minute walk to get to Lau Pat Sat. So many stalls and so many wonderful options! I wish they had hawker centres in Canada!
,,You Want Street Food ?? Start Here....,5.0,,"If you want to experience all of the foods found in Singapore in a clean and safe area, then this the Lau Pa Sat Center is where you want to be. Food is excellent, as is the selection, and the prices can't be beat.
However, to truly experience Singapore street food, visit Lau Pa Sat after 8 p.m. This is when the bar-b-que vendors come out, and one of the main streets is closed off to car traffic. Here, you can truly experience Satay right off the grill."
,,Go for great satay!,5.0,,"While this is a food center, a side street closes at 7pm where satay and other vendors set up their carts, tables and chairs. After reading recommendations for #7 (easy to remember, go at 7 to 7), they now are actually 7 & 8. Ordered the meat combo with prawns. It was so good and perfect late night snack."
,,"A great, safe place to eat late at night!",4.0,,"This food market at night is great, choices galore! Just make sure you walk right down to the back area where there are many more lovely food outlets. Very cheap for families as Singapore restaurants can be expensive."
,,So much choice,5.0,,"Have been here several times over the years, has had a face lift since last time here that I knew about and so pleased that the historical building is same only store fronts upgraded. So much variety and cuisines to choose from and cheap as and freshly made to order, first thing I always have here is satay out on a street that is closed off for the night so good. I remember the original Satay club in Singapore which is long gone but a few of the originals are still here I believe now, the one thing I find very annoying is the touting for business that wasn't allowed at the old place, one particular fellow from store 8 and 9 was grabbing everyone, he sat us down but we went to another stall that I prefer from previous visit and he cracked it big time, was going off at the other stall holder all the time we were there I think when he saw how many satays we were demolishing got him angrier anyway I'm sure you can sit where you please and eat at any store of your choosing you just have to shoo away the touters."
,,Awesome selection of food,5.0,,If you want to experience all of the foods found in Singapore and a very clean and area then this is it. It's like the upscale version of the local outdoor markets. Food is very good and there is a HUGE selection.
,,Fascinating building,4.0,,"The building itself has been beautifully renovated. The food stalls are easy to navigate around and there are plenty of tables. The toilets were a little hard to find (on the outer rim) but we did locate them in the end! Prices probably a little higher than some and most of the stalls seemed to be a ""B"" for cleanliness."
,,Amore of the same,3.0,,We had been referred to try a particular dish at this market. However there were several vacant stalls and nobody to assist us with what we were looking for.
,,disappointing!,3.0,,"too hyped and a let down on arrival. Touts accost you on arrival. ignore them, if they need to tout the food is poor. check out the stalls with queues and be prepared to wait."
,,Too much hype - I'd give this a skip!,3.0,,"I only have a few words for this place. Pricey, smokey, bad parking facilities, too crowded for my liking. slow service from some of the stalls. There are other better places with better food. If you really must, then only visit for the experience of the above mentioned. Good luck!"
,,Always delivers,5.0,,It's been a few years since I've been here and it's had a revamp. Still delivers with its wide range of good food at good (for Singapore) prices. Definitely worth a visit.
,,The food is not great,2.0,,I came here with lots of expectation and I left disappointed. The satays were dried and some were burnt. The seafood was below standard. There are better places to eat.
,,Many options... but not fresh,3.0,,"Many options available. I counted at least 4 indian food shops, each of them offering different dishes.
In general, food is very tasty and cheap . However, the food is not that fresh nor healthy. They have prepared most food in advanced and defrost the meat as required, and overloaded with salt. Also, there not fresh juices either. The available fruit juices are overloaded with sugar. I only went once for the experience, but thats it."
,,Touristy but ok,3.0,,"Went here after walking back from Marina bay.

Was old market converted to a tourist eating area. Not a fan of so many touts trying to get your business (Go to a real local hawker centre and theres no touts trying to get you to sit down and buy off them.)

Saying that it was clean and satay was nice. Nice to go there and look and try but there is better options out there."
,,Not on a rainy day.,4.0,,"Good, if modern, food centre. The hawker centre is in the street after dusk. However if it rains it only works as a food centre. The Hawkers cant set up"
,,"Hawker centre, based in central business district and close to Chinatown",4.0,,"I agree with all recent reviews the food variety and quality at this hawker centre is excellent, not always the cheapest, however there are a number of vendors selling great Indian vegetarian food. The structure and building is traditional and worth going to look at that. If you want some cheap eats this is worth a visit"
,,A lot of different kinds of food,5.0,,"You can find a lot of different food stalls here. The food we tried was delicious and not really expensive. There are foodcourts which are cheaper, but this one is definitely worth a visit."
,,La Pau Sat Satay.,5.0,,"La Pau Sat ( recommend Street Stalls 7&8) gives a great street atmosphere of what Hawkers Stalls provide in Singapore. Try the mixed prawns, beef & chicken sticks that come with the most tastiest of satay sauce."
,,City Luncheon Central,4.0,,"This is in the heart of the CBD and where everyone seems to go for lunch from the nearby offices. The high rises tower over this lovely steel, band stand like structure that make for a cool setting. And what an array of food. Lots of local and other 'Asian Fusion' obviously, but also Indian and I even saw one stand from Costa Rica. I imagine there are far more! Well worth a visit around 12-1pm on a week day. (Tip: Save a table by placing business cards etc on a spare one whilst searching for food you like; no one will steal it)."
,,Great atmosphere and good food!,5.0,,Had dinner surrounded by high-rise building. The atmosphere was great. Satay was great. Large choice of food.
,,The best local cuisine bang in the middle of the central business district!!,5.0,,"This was my 2nd visit to Lau Pa Sat Festival Pavilion. This is a huge covered building which houses more than 50 food stalls dishing out local and world cuisine. This is a lovely place right in the middle of the Singapore Central Business District (CBD). It is open from all sides. It is octagonal in shape with ornamental pillars. It has historic architecture from the British time. Really a must visit either for lunch or dinner. The best part of this place is that even if it rains, you can sit there and eat while getting a glimpse of the fast-moving corporate life of Singapore. We went for lunch when we saw lots of local people working in CBD coming for lunch. The last time I had gone was for dinner and then it takes a more touristy turn.

Things to keep in mind/tips/recommendations:

1. How to reach - by bus you have to get down at 1, Raffles Quay bus stop. By MRT you have to go to Promenade MRT (Circle Line).

2. There are many stalls including Indian ones. It is like a jigsaw puzzle and you can lose your sense of direction as every side looks the same! You have world cuisine also. So, you can find anything and everything under one roof. There are only a few liquor stalls, so you have to literally go around and find them.

3. This place is awesome. It has those giant ceiling fans which just adds to the charm of the place. The historic architecture, the setting, the open sided from all sides makes this place really worth it to visit once. And then the place is a flat one storey structure which is surrounded in all directions by tall commercial buildings of the CBD area. It is really unique.

4. About the quality of food, nothing home to write about. But, we are not experts in finding the right place/stall. I guess you need to know which stalls are famous and have very good food. I saw some stalls which had lots of newspaper reviews being shown off. I also saw one particular stall which had these reviews and then many Uber Eats personnel waiting to pick up food. So, my guess is that there are some stalls there which dish out very famous food. But, how to find them, don't ask me. Maybe it is available on the net or maybe you have to ask a few locals.

5. Places nearby - You have Merlion Park which is just 1 bus stop away. So, after having lunch here, we hopped across to Merlion Park to see the famous Singapore Lion statue which spits out water into the sea. It is also very near the famous Gardens By The Bay (just 2-3 bus stops away). The Singapore Flyer is also right next door. So, a visit to any of these places can be planned with a visit to Lau Pa Sat.

This is a highly recommended place in Singapore. Something unique and you will not be disappointed. More than the food, it is the place which you must see and experience."
,,"Great location, food variety in one roof.",4.0,,"It set in an amazing building in the CBD, though was a bit hot and humid that Summer day. Food is so varieties, yummy and inexpensive. I knew that it would be more interesting and more busy too at night but we happened to walk around there during lunch time so we decided to have lunch there. Many stalls are open for lunch on the weekend. Would definitely recommend to eat there."
,,Great variety of food,4.0,,"This food court had very good. Food from many Asian countries. But almost no napkins! Relatively clean tables, but fans don't always keep you cool."
,,Only Satay street in Singapore at night,4.0,,"So satays, hawker centers, grilled foods are all over Singapore and you can find cheap good stuff to enjoy in many places especially hawker centers.
But this one behind Lau Pa Sat hawker center (Telok Ayer Market) is the ONLY one in Singapore that closed off the street (Boon Tat Street) every night at 7 pm till late and is an experience not to miss. You are sitting in the midst of a business district street and get to enjoy (on a nice night) good outdoor grilled foods, beer in a casual atmosphere. Great to have lots of friends to share basically a street party.
And the Lau Pa Sat Pavilion inside also offers lots of other food choices if satay is not your thing."
,,What used to be,2.0,,"We have often over the years been to Lay Pa Sat but Im afraid its got a bit tacky and the hustlers drive you crazy..Granted it was New Year not all the stalls were open but we were shocked at the prices and actually service was not great either
Not a place on my return list"
,,Great outdoor dining spot!,4.0,,"If you can get rid of the vendors trying to force their menus on you, go for a stroll before you decide what to eat... Lots of food stalls to choose from! The best place for Satays - grilled by the 1000's on the street.
I had the best black pepper crab, well wirth a try!"
,,delicious,5.0,,the seafood was awesome and easy access with bus. weekend was full and with the road closure make it more spacious place to eat
,,Satay... yum!,5.0,,"The satay from 7and 8 outside was delicious. It is such a great atmosphere sitting out in the warmth of the evening with a cold Tiger beer (coming from a non-beer drinker!), the smoke from the satay grills and great company."
,,Inspection visit for future ref,4.0,,This is simply an experience not to be missed when in Singapore one simply has to eat somewhere and indeed why not in a hyper supermarket restaurant outlet there must be hundreds of mini kitchens all offering their particular nationality or speciality. I highly recommend that you go and company so that you can enjoy sharing the various dishes on offer. One can either eat indoors or outside. One good tip is to not dress up for the location this is an extremely casual eating experience and best not to wear your good cloths.
,,Food Food and Food,5.0,,"You get all kinds of food in this place. This is the favourite lunch out place for people working in the CBD area. This is the office area and at the heart of it. If you want to have food here, be patient to find a place to have your food."
,,Love it!,4.0,,"Step back in time at Lau Pa Sat. Traditional hawker food stalls, but in a fantastic building with good levels of cleanliness and a great atmosphere!"
,,The best stay prawns ever,4.0,,Well worth a visit my wife and I had planned to visit the market the evening we first arrived but unfortunately due delayed flights we only had a quick visit to this famous hawker street food.We had to eat on satay street which is closed off at night. Good street food not expensive for Singapore great atmosphere well wort the visit
,,Good variety of food options,4.0,,"Situated in the Central Business District area
- fairly accessible to public transport
- good variety of food options that appeals to all types of cuisines and taste buds from Indian to Chinese to South American

My favourite is Thunder Tea Rice, a Chinese vegetarian dish"
,,Food court and outdoor casual dining,4.0,,"It is an excellent opportunity to see and taste local food and culture.
A variety of food stalls sell typical food found in Singapore. In the evenings, the outside street is converted into a open air food street selling satay and various local dishes.
Food is reasonably priced."
,,Nice food court in a nice building,4.0,,"Lau Pa Sat is a historic site with bags of history. It houses many stalls selling different types of singapore and world cuisine. In the evening, it does get really busy. My suggestion if you visit Lau Pa Sat is to wander around and check the different stalls. Don't go with the people who offer you stuff as they tend to be quiet pricey. Lovely old iron-work and architecture comprise the fabric of the building."
,,Just go there!,5.0,,Visit Singapore for already many years but forget to visit this place at least once a week. Friendly people and delicious food!
,,Newly renovated,4.0,,"I’ve seen this place evolve over the decades. Last time I visited it was newly renovated and has quite a number of stalls selling different types of cuisines. The Indian food was good (though not Muthu’s) as was the fishball noodles. Not as local as Maxwell or Amoy street markets, but good if you want everything under one roof. Lucky for folks working in the CBD."
,,Excellent street food - value for money,5.0,,Very casual but extremely clean food hall where you can eat all the local delicacy at a fraction of price you would pay elswhere. I so much enjoyed my mixed sate platter for $17 Singapore dollars.
,,BEST SATAYs EVER,5.0,,"Busy, Smokey, Loud, Cheap, BUT BEST OF ALL, the best satays and atmosphere for an evening meal - but don't upset the YOU WANT BEER waitresses"
,,A hawker food area as it should be,4.0,,"If you want good Satay, and reasonably priced food (various) this is one place to go. The other being infamous one is Newton (bbq stingray). Lots of choices of food here but not the cheapest food court in town...

In Singapore, buy your own tissues, sit at a rocky stool on the street outdoors or indoors, enjoy the hustle and bustle of the atmosphere. This is what a hawker street style is like. It doesn't get more authentic than this.

I've rated it very good because of the food and atmosphere.

Cleanliness is Singapore standard, higher than most Asian countries but not the typical clean western style food courts.

Come here for authentic experience and like it as it is."
,,Dinner,4.0,,A great place to have dinner. Many meal choices amongst many varied vendors. Make sure you look all around the venue before you make your choice or you could miss out on some great food.
,,Newly renovated,5.0,,"I knew Lau Pa Sat in the old way from former visits. I was positvly surprised, that after the renovation, the atmosphere is still nice: Birds flying around, smelling of nice food and so many choices of food."
,,Great atmosphere for diner,4.0,,"Tables are set in the street at 7pm on the dot

Positives:
* Food is of great quality
* Diversity of taste is fabulous
* Seafood is fresh
* Waiting time / Service is decent

Negatives:
* Overpriced for a food court

This is a great moment for a visit in Singapore or a relaxed evening after work:
Enjoy!"
,,Has to be the Best Satay in Singapore,5.0,,"We took some friends to Lau Pa Sat.
The street next to the pavilion is closed off at 7 pm,and then the satay stalls start up.
Satay cooked on coals the old way, is the best. Our friends from the UK were amazed at the taste and value for money. We left satisfied and smiling, its a great experience eating at this hawker market. The seafood in the pavilion itself is also worth a try, delicious.
The old La Pa Sat structure is worth a visit takes you back to old Colonial Singapore."
,,Best Hawker in Singapore!,5.0,,We visited several hawkers while in singapore -this was our favorite! Pepper Express Indian Food was our favorite Hawker in all of town! such friendly people and great food!
,,SATAY SATAY SATAY,5.0,,"An icon in Singapore, Lau Pa Sat is a must-visit for tourists and locals alike. There's an enormous variety of food on offer, from Western to Singaporean, Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese, Indian, you name it. Particularly delicious are the Murtabaks (A stuffed pancake of Asian origin), and, of course, satay. Cooked freshly in-front of you, the satay sticks are cooked in a sticky-sweet marinade and are fantastic. Highly recommend."
,,Highly recommended !,4.0,,Lau Pa Sat was recommended to us by a friend. Best recommendation for a good feed of satay. Arrived early in the evening and once we found the street side with the tables set up it was game on. Hawkers beconing for you business wether it be satay or any Asian cuisine you can think of. Tiger girls serving up icy cold jugs of Tiger beer add to the entertainment. We had a huge serve of mixed satay and some hot fresh Naan bread with curry sauce. All was just delectable. A must visit for true Singapore hawker food.
,,An entertaining meal in Singapore,4.0,,"Lau Pa Sat is a favourite of ours in Singapore, we always find our way here at least once to enjoy a meal with loads of atmosphere. Timing is everything, 7:30pm is about right, busy but you'll get a table quick enough.

We (over) ordered a variety of food, 2 medium Mie Goreng (each serve was enough for 2), satay sticks, Nasi Goreng and a chicken Naan Bread with curry dipping sauce. WAY TOO MUCH for the 6 of us. Really enjoyed the Naan Bread, absolutely fantastic.

Some say its not true Singapore but hey, we're tourist and really enjoy it so have a look for yourself, you'll enjoy it too."
,,A little Stressful but lovely,4.0,,An amazing evening eating stunning food. Please ensure to support the Uncles by buying wet wipes... the beginning of the evening was a little stressful with being seated and choosing a Saté stall as there are so many.
,,"Options, options and more options",5.0,,"visited this place in November during my trip to Singapore. You get every possible option you looking for. Indian, Chinese, Singaporean cuisines, juices, fruits, etc. And to top up is the ambience. And pls don't forget to capture your moment with the HUGE fans"
,,food food and more food,4.0,,"we visited la pau sat 3 times whilst in Singapore. We went during the day at lunch and also tried the evening bbq, the food prices are very reasonably priced. and it a good place to try different food."
,,Satay outdoors,4.0,,enjoyed the evening having barbequed satay under the stars. it was a beautiful night and certainly not too hot or humid for dinner. Enjoyed the many stalls with so many diff cultures so we tried some of the other stalls
,,Great foodie destination!,5.0,,"Must try place when visiting Singapore. It's a clean hawker center, serving great local and western food. You can also find satay stalls here, and almost everyone serves the same good tasting goodness on sticks.
Nice place to hang-out with friends over a pitcher of brew. Did I mention they have clean restrooms here?"
,,"Its a place for food, nothing much to see otherwise",2.0,,The history is interesting - the ornate metal pieces around roof were shipped to Singapore over a century ago. Otherwise this is just a food court. It is quite cool since it has high roof
,,Sticky. Gross. Bad service. No thanks.,2.0,,"I’ve heard so many good things about this hawker centre, but unfortunately I was highly disappointed. It’s a very large hawker center and the choices appear endless. Skewers seem to be the number one seller - I’m talking a tray of 50-60 skewers with shrimp, chicken, beef, lamb, and pork (if you go to the Chinese sellers). It looked amazing, but I was really irritated by people trying to sell us their food or to go to their stall. I enjoy perusing for what to eat in peace and not rushed, thank you.

Also, as a Westerner, I expect certain things when I eat - like napkins and a clean eating space. Nope, they don’t exist. Once you order your food, they are gone and they won’t look twice at you again.

Tables aren’t the cleanest. Eh, I don’t think I’ll be coming back."
,,Mind-boggling variety!,4.0,,"This is the mother of all food courts. Whether you want to eat Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Indian, Italian, Middle-eastern..etc..you name it, and Lau Pa Sat has it. Reasonably priced as well. Sheltered seating as well as open air seating available."
,,Great for Street Food!,5.0,,"Relatively inexpensive for Singapore, this is a great place to sample a range of dishes from the dozens of street food stalls. You order from as many as you like and they bring to your table - pay each one separately. Really buzzing place!"
,,Just love the experience,5.0,,We had been here a couple of times last year and was a must this year. Just love the food and the atmosphere.
,,the most beautiful hawker center in Singapore,5.0,,"Located right next to the lovely Boutique hotel Sofitel So, the Lau Pa Sat Hawker Center was our spot for couple of diners in town. The visitors are quiet mixed, a lot of expats, Singaporians and tourists. Though this hawker center is the priciest one, it is the most beautiful one and definitely worth trying."
,,Late dinner,4.0,,"Jumped on the MRT to Raffles Station and after a short 2 minute walk arrived at Lau Pa Sat food market. Great choice of food. Don't just go for the Satay, as they will grab you when you arrive to do so, instead sit down and try different snacks from all the different restaurants/hawkers. Beer also available."
,,Good atmosphere - food very fair,2.0,,"we just spent a week in Singapore, and ate at some excellent outdoor Hawker markets every night.
This one is certainly the best known, very large and with good range of food, but the actual food we had here was the worst we had in Singapore.
The Chicken with rice was tough and grisly, and the Indian food very fair quality too.
Perhaps this has become too much of a tourist trap for it's own good. You're better off going to a less well known one, or any of the ones below shopping malls - all excellent"
,,Best place to eat Sate 🍢🍢🍤🍽🍴,5.0,,"It is the most popular place to have open barbecue of SATE Fresh, have a lot of choices, near to city center"
,,tourist trap watch out,3.0,,"lau pa sat has degenerated to a tourist trap with expensive food, poor ventilation and people pestering you to buy food from them. you easily pay 50% more than what you get at hawker stalls. food quality is just as bad."
,,nice food,5.0,,"so many food around the place. very nice loca food, there are also food from other country as well.."
,,Food Court,4.0,,I came here to have lunch after doing all the sightseeing. It's a good place to visit when you're hungry. There are plenty of food choices to eat and cheap as well. The food court is also clean and have fan so it doesn't feel hot inside the food court.
,,Great hawker centre,4.0,,"Centrally located in the CBD, this is one of the best hawker centres to visit. Great selection of vendors, in modern facility. Always busy yet very easy for the uninitiated tourists to experience this way of dining. Open 24 hours."
,,Great location eating in the middle of the CBD,3.0,,"This is a great location to eat. We had satay, noodles and beer here during the cool of a November evening. Being able to eat whilst looking up at the Skyscrapers in the middle of the central business district was good.

The layout is a series of small food vendors who appear to have staff who try to get you to buy the food from them, this can be tiring when you arrive as we were surround by 6 people all trying to get food/beer from them, who would not take no for an answer. Additionally the people trying to sell tissues at 5 minute intervals didn't help matters.

Having said that the Satay and noodles were excellent and the beer suitably cold. Well worth a visit just prepared for the vultures!!"
,,Lots of choice,4.0,,"Lots of different stalls selling different cuisines, all really reasonable in price, much cheaper than restaurants. Plenty of tables so if there is more than one person you can all choose which type of food you want - you don't have to have the same. Outside there are BBQ stalls selling satay & other grilled food, lots of seating there too. Well worth a visit."
,,Local Feel and great food,4.0,,"Lau Pa Sat offers a great introduction to Hawkers Market style dining being a little more western and modern than most while still providing a cross section of cuisine to reflect the diverse cultural mix that is Singapore. Malay.Indian,Chinese, Vegetarian can all be found under the magnificent Iron Lace Pagoda or if you like Satay then dining in ""Satay Street"" in the evening is a really tasty and fun experience. I would recommend ""Best Satay No 7 & 8"" who have proven consistency and are reasonably priced. A selection of Beef,Chicken and Prawn satay sticks and a jug of Tiger Beer can be enjoyed for under S$40.00 for 2 people and while not as cheap as some Hawker style dining option in Singapore is still great value for the experience. If sitting outside in Satay Street a man comes round selling packets of tissues/wet wipes for S$2-$3 , very useful when you have finished the satay and if you leave them on the table when you go to get a drink etc. if is a sign that someone is sitting there and reserves you spot.
(A tip when dining at any street style stall in Singapore is to always look for the Food Hygiene Standards rating certificate - A , B,C, D and it is recommended to only eat from A or B rated stalls.)
Take time to enjoy the great atmosphere and don't miss this iconic Singapore location on your next visit to Singapore."
,,Wong Kee BBQ Seafood.,1.0,,We had possibly the worst meal I can remember at Wong Kee BBQ Seafood. A black pepper crab that didn't have black pepper in it but was so far over cooked it was unbearable. The scallops the same. We ordered 4 dishes and not one was acceptable. To cap off the evening the staff didn't want to know a thing about it. Give it a huge miss....
,,Local eating,4.0,,"Great place to sample all the local foods with plenty of different stalls to choose from.
You are able to sit inside under a fan and order stays from any of the satay stall members and they will bring inside for you.
We walked from Chinatown afyer spending the afternoon there and had dinner here and then walked on to the Merion after our satay dinner."
,,A taste of Singapore,4.0,,Has a wide variety of food to choose from within a city with a mix culture. Chili crab and satay with peanut sauce should not be missed.
,,Go there for the Satay.,4.0,,"A little more upmarket hawker centre by day( prices that is!) Satay sellers come out at night. It is not cheap, about $36 for 30 sticks + extras for greens, drinks etc. Great food though and an interesting atmosphere."
,,Clean modern and delicous food,4.0,,Lau Pa Sat is much more modern than most hawker centres around Singapore. The choice is food is comparable to other hawker centres with most cuisines available. The cuisines are clearly labelled which helps if you feel overwhelmed by the menu choices in other hawker centres. The facilities are much newer too. I will definitely come back to Lau Pa Sat.
,,Good Food for low price,4.0,,"if you want to have a good variety of food for a really low price this is one of the best options, it has around 40 stalls like a food court, and you can try Indian, vegetarian, Asian, etc. Singapore Try Laksa even if the weather is hot as normal in Singapore you will this traditional dish."
,,Streets of Food,4.0,,Satay stall holder 8 has very nice satay. They are on the outside of the building. The food is really nice at any of the stalls. Nice to try something different.
,,Absolutely delicious - a must-visit!,5.0,,"Our first night in Singapore finished on a high with a visit to Lau Pa Sat. We arrived rather late (around 8.30pm on a week night) and were concerned that there wouldn't be much activity, but quickly realised that everything was still buzzing. We found some exceptional Indian food and a jug of beer - heaven! We also visited a second time during our stay to try the satay stands outside and both times were very impressed with the quality of the meal and the flavours! Definitely recommended!"
,,Picturesque Venue,4.0,,Lau Pa Sat is a historic building located within the Downtown Core in the financial district of Singapore. A quaint building with ornate cast iron pillars that hold up a terracotta roof. On the roof is a distinctive clock tower. It is currently a bustling food center which offers a variety of Asian cuisine and at reasonable prices. At 7:00 pm the road behind the building is closed to all traffic and the satay street opens. It is a fun place and a picturesque venue for dining.
,,Local Taste with a modern feel,4.0,,"Having been to several food markets this one sat at the top of my list. Still being able to experience local food this place also had a other options that you could enjoy. Lots of stalls, lots of space and very easy to find, just jump on the MRT and it's 2 blocks from the nearst station, suitable for all the family. Popular, as you will see when you walk around, are the satay sticks (10 for $7.00) and a jug of Tiger Beer to wash it all down with. There are other drink options so something for everyone."
,,It's an experience.,5.0,,"Amazing array of dining experiences. Go outside to the closed off road on a Friday, Saturday and Sunday evening for some great satay. Good tip is not to sit under the trees as the birds constantly fly from buildings to trees and you will get a load of leaves dropping into your drinks and on to your food. Its a little confusing ordering if you want other foods as they are not the same vendors as the satay stalls so you order from several vendors and pay each one separately up front."
,,A must eat and visit place !,5.0,,Excellent variety of food available in this market. Almost covers all asian cuisines with lots to choose from for vegetarians also. Makes a great lunch / dinner place for one and all.. Would highly recommend to go and have a taste of authentic roadside food and take in the ambience and enjoy singapore..
,,Must Go for Foodies...,5.0,,If u are a foodie then Lao Pa Sat is the place to be to enjoy a variety of multi national Cuisines at jaw dropping Prices...
,,"Delicious, as always!",5.0,,The cereal prawn never gets old. :) I usually visit Lau Pa Sat whenever I'm in Singapore. Great food choices especially at night.
,,A great place to dine,5.0,,"If you're out for local dishes, then this is the place for you. With lots of varieties to choose from."
,,EVERY FOOD YOUR HEART DESIRES,5.0,,"I LOVE this place! It's new and old, traditional and modern, professionals and everyday folks, tourists and locals, pastry and kopi-c. It's clean and bright which makes it an easy first-time hawker center experience for visitors. But the food is great: Singaporean, Indonesian, Indian, Japanese Ramen, Turkish, Pizza, Lakhsa, Pau, Everything! As a mostly vegetarian I can always find something yummy to eat which is no small task in Hawker Center Singapore. Love it!"
,,"Location, location, location",5.0,,"Great food, great price and in the middle of the city, it is the perfect place to eat after doing touristy things during the day.y. The architecture is also really beautiful."
,,Lau Pa Sat,4.0,,This is basically a food court where we can find a variety of food at a very reasonable price . The quality and prepRation is fresh and gd and is very popular with working class. It is mostly crowded at lunch time .
,,A must do,5.0,,"Being a ex-local, this is my go-to place when I return home for a visit. Lots of food stalls that represent a cross section of the local culture in Singapore. Cheap and Clean, order a sample of dishes from different stalls and enjoy!!!! No where else in the world would you get the variety plus feasting with a peace of mind that you won't come down with a nasty food bourne disease."
,,A taste of the local food,5.0,,"In front of me a beautiful colonial building stood with hoards of tourists heading towards it and yes I could see the food stalls too.
The Lau Pa Sat stands uniquely in the midst of all of modern day Singapore
Lau Pa Sat

I went in and started looking at the food options there. The usual Chinese food was there, the Indian Vegetarian food was there and well the Halal food stalls were there too. The thing that I have really enjoyed about South East Asia is the Food Courts/ Centres that are almost everywhere, the choices are vast and great and the prices are pretty nominal. Lau Pa Sat was no different, there were great choices of food and the prices were pretty decent as well. The Food court is in itself a piece of Singapore’s heritage. Initially, the market was built somewhere else and then moved to this location around 1894 or so, and then as all things in Singapore, was renovated/removed/rebuilt, but cared for as a symbol of their heritage.

One of the many food stalls and dining areas of Lau Pa Sat
As you enter the building which is open from 8 sides (an octagon in shape) the first thing you notice is the beautiful steel beams and the massive fans. The victorian feeling of the building has remained intact though the number of tables and chairs on the floor make it very crowded and un-victorian.

The building has a clock tower in the centre complete with a jacquemart (a bell ringer) that rings the bells. I couldn't get a good picture of it.

The bell ringer and the bells.
After appreciating the structure and its colonial past, it was then time to enjoy the food. I looked around and found this stall with a big Halal sign on it (even though there were other Halal stalls ). Since it was the biggest Halal sign it was a sign and that was the place I was going to have my dinner at :)
Most of the food stalls in Singapore have a sign showing their category. The category is usually A or B (i didn’t see a C), which basically tells you the price point. So this stall was a category B stall. Looking at all the chicken rice dishes , chicken rice it was. The cost was a mere 4 SGD.
My usual food stall with the variety of chicken rice
The food was alright, I kinda enjoyed it as I was absolutely hating the junk food.

the 4 SGD chicken rice set
The Set had soup, rice chicken. The serving size was just enough, the taste was good. So for the next couple of days on and off I enjoyed a variety of chicken rice.
Once you had finished there was always someone to pick up your plates and thats where I saw something very interesting. The Halal dishes were separate from the non Halal ones. On the side of the market was the washing area for the dishes and interestingly there the Halal and non-Halal washing areas were separate too. That indeed was quite considerate.

The Dish washing area of Lau Pa Sat
Outside Lau Pa Sat are these Satay stalls. Lots of them with lots of Satay. I thought about trying but then I just couldn’t convince my self enough. Plus the hustling in that area was something you don’t see in Singapore."
,,Home of all Local kitchens,5.0,,"If there is any one home where I have been fed from a youngster ( on a teenage date or as a working novice ) through a mid-adult ( a family meal or business hangout ) until be an elder ( alone or with peers ) ; Lau Pa Sat is the venue where I am always spoilt for choice of light or heavy meals. And most all , the meals are still as local as like yesterday yet teasing the taste bud yearning for something special. I am never been disappointed in taste, comfort and prices which are all genuinely local from every perspectives. The best place for every visitor to feel a taste of uniquely Singapore ."
,,Bbq,4.0,,"Took the subway to lau pa sat, easy to do.. lots of BBQ and seafood of every kind,prices very affordable."
,,Lots of Good Local Food,5.0,,Alot of good local food that you will be spoiled for choices. You may try the BBQ Satay and Stingrays or the Beef noodles there. All are equally good.
,,Loads to choose from and pretty cheap,5.0,,"We headed to Lau Pa Sat on a recommendation and it did not disappoint. A large selection of pretty much any street food you can think of at cheap for Singapore prices. However street food here is still way more expensive than other countries I have visited and it is much more of a western feel than some of the street food markets I have been to in Thailand, Hong Kong, Central America etc. Plenty of seating and fans to keep the air moving. In the evening the Satay vendors are keen to get you to there stalls but generally it's is a relaxed atmosphere and you can walk freely as you choose what you fancy. My personal favourite was the Dim Sum located in the middle. We are here everyday while on our stop over in Singapore. Would recommend to all food lovers."
,,One of SIngapore's Oldest Hawker Centers,4.0,,This review is quite late. The Lau Pa Sat Festival was the very first hawker center I visited in Singapore. For less money you can have already have a feast.
,,Vibrant dining destination in the city,5.0,,"Spotted this venue from the hop on hop off bus on our first day and decided to return a couple of night later to sample the famous Satay Sthe. The number of choices of cuisines and dishes on offer was nearly overwhelming and most of it was so cheap it made it hard to choose. There are a few stalls that actively tout their business as soon as you walk in the door but take the time to wander around before deciding,"
,,Sate Heaven,4.0,,This is a great place to eat the local sate dishes. It also has afood hall in which to try all the local cuisine on offer.
,,One of the Best Places to Eat in Singapore,5.0,,"If you're looking for a great place to eat in Singapore then head for Lau Pa Sat Hawker Centre. The variety and quality of food on offer is second to none, and at very reasonable prices. If you have a hankering for excellent Satay (Chicken, Beef, Mutton <goat> or Prawns) then you need to go in the evening as it is only available at night."
,,"Stalls 7 and 8, outside, far side for satay",5.0,,"Followed a local recommendation to wade through the interior and look for outdoor barbeque smoke, and find stalls 7 and 8. 14SGD for 10/10 beef/chicken, with a handful of rough chopped onions and cukes, and two bowls of sweet, substantial peanut sauce. Add 7SGD and get 5/5 more, all the way up to XL, with 25/25 piled on a tray looking like an army of archers fired meat arrows at the waiter. Larger eating area filled with many options, clean and bustling in an upscale area - huge construction nearby currently giving Google Maps a bit of challenge to get you there from the sMRT station."
,,Local food court in middle of financial center,4.0,,"If you are in the financial district and want reasonably priced local food or a quick bite to eat this is a place to check out. On offer are a variety of Singaporean, Chinese, Indian, Pinoy as well as some western dishes served by a couple dozen hawker stands inside the Lau Pa Sat food court. It gets a bit warm in there despite the overhead fans and its busy during peak times given their location. If you go during lunch time try to get there early to get the best selection as some things such as dosa sell out quickly.

Tried some of the Indian (curry, dhal, chicken etc) and Chinese dishes (Hainanese chicken rice, roast pork) from 3 different stalls -- two of which were great and one that was not. Our experience with stall #6 -- ""Fragrance Garden Chicken Rice"" -- was very poor. Staff was rude and the food wasn't up to the standards you should expect at a minimum at these food stalls. Would not recommend eating there. Should note that this was an atypical experience we had during our trip in Singapore as everyone was generally very friendly and food was usually at a basic minimum of average quality.

I would recommend the Korean Ice cream shop called Gangnam Bingsu. They serve a different type of shaved ice compared to the Singaporean version. We had the Snow Flake Injeomi Bingsu with ice cream on top which was great. The small version came to SGD 7.9 (5.9 without the ice cream scoop on top) which was plenty to share between 2-3 people. Also good at Lau Pa Sat are the cut fruit or lychee drinks (at SGD 2.4 around 20% more expensive than at other food courts which is probably due to it being located in the financial district).

All in we spend around SGD 25 for 3 dishes for lunch plus desert that fed 3-4 people. The quality of the food (with the noted exception) was in line with other food courts we tried. Would recommend for quick bite to eat if you're in the area and want something fast plus variety to choose from."
,,Local Culture,4.0,,"Great choice of foods under the one roof, cheap and plentiful. QUick and efficient and good quality. Highly recommended for some local and regional flavours."
,,Survivor for me...,5.0,,"Though it was not near to my hotel but wasn't too far that I could not reach there to get my food.. When everything seems to be chicken,mutton, beef, pork etc. I could find some really delicious Indian restaurants and vegetarian food in Lau pa Sat.. The best part was taste coz if you go out of India its difficult to get the real taste of Indian flavor."
,,Wonderful satey,4.0,,"Stalls set along a closed street mainly selling satey which is a barbequed meat of either chicken, lamb or goat. Mixed with some peanuet sauce and a mixture of onions and cucumber. Must try!"
,,Over priced,3.0,,"Although the satay was tasty, it was way over priced. I mean if you don't know of anywhere else to have satay then I guess it's ok."
,,Simple Food Court and Eatery Area,3.0,,"This is a sheltered food court within the city area. There are a mix of stalls, eateries and hawker stalls within the vicinity. It looks like a simple food court only to me. Nothing special about the place."
,,Excellent variety of Food Stalls,4.0,,"Had lunch there recently with 7 friends , not easy to get a table anywhere between 12.00 and 1.30 as all the local people from all the office nearby eat there . But fluked a table where only 3 people were eating. The trick is to put your business card or a tissue packet on the table to reserve your spot so you can go and suss out the food stalls. There must be at least 70 food and drink outlets, lots of choices , good sized meals , my pork disk was great together with a lime juice or two for under 18.00. Closest station is Telok Ayer but not far from China town station either. I think it would be very busy on nights and weekends but worth the effort."
,,Great atmosphere and food,5.0,,Went for dinner and great atmosphere and buzz on a Friday night. Food was good with attentive service.
,,fantastic place in the middle of concrete jungle!,4.0,,"This is a really nice place right in the middle of towers, with a variety of food options on offer, including vegetarian food. It is basically a food court. Nice to see something like this preserved even after such towers were built all around it."
,,Yummy Cheap Food,4.0,,"A must visit on a trip to Singapore. Loads of great food at this hawker market (basically a local food court) but in lovely surroundings. Indoors we first shared Chilli Crab which was messy but very tasty, then we had some pork and noodles which was really good but then we headed outside to Stalls 7&8 for great satay. We were shown to a table in rows and rows of tables and offered 3 menu options based on how much you can eat, we chose Menu B (15 chicken, 15 beef and 10 prawns) and we were stuffed at the end. Quick service, hot and delicious. Top Tip: take your own wet wipes - the provided tissues just don't work well but there was a guy walking around selling wet wipes if you forget."
,,Not the best place for satay. Not anymore,3.0,,"I know many people just pick this place to welcome their friends from oversea, we both agree that the location is excellent, the asmosphere is fine too since it's always very crowd. But correct me if I'm wrong, the place is full of smoke, the quality of satay and the food are not good anymore. People choose this place just because it's convenient for them. Since you dont care much about quality of the food, take your friends and family to Satay club where it's next to the water, where it's more windy and surrounded by nice places such as Marina Bay and Marina Barrage where you get awesome view back to the city. Do it."
,,Quick dinner,3.0,,"Was recommend buy a friend to come here for some good food. So many hawkers in your face I think we just went with the least annoying person . Was told the satay was the best around, not to sure about that?The beers was cheap. Maybe we just picked the wrong place to eat from"
,,One of the best hawker centers in Asia!,5.0,,We just walked up and grabbed a table outside and started ordering by just pointing on the menu and were rewarded with a smorgasboard of delicious food! The ambience at Lau Pa Sat is amazing - you're sitting in this old time hawkers market surrounded by the fanciest big financial buildings - a true glimpse of the duality of Singapore. All at really reasonable rates!
,,Don't miss the Lau Pa Sat!,5.0,,"Any trip to Singapore is incomplete without a visit to the hawker spot known as the Lau Pa Sat! If you want a real taste of S'pore food you should visit the many hawker spots. Mix and match from different vendors and be sure to get dessert! If you're feeling adventurous, try an ice Kacang!"
,,Great Hawker centre in a unique building,5.0,,"Really liked this Hawker Centre located in a great victorian steel framed building. Had a nice feel to it and was very clean as well.

Lots of choices, including the usual local and Chinese fare, but also a few Vietnamese and also a Turkish outlet. We tried a few things (parathas were very good!) and it was all very good and reasonably priced. Attracts locals and tourists alike, and was busy but not packed out when we visited on a weekday evening."
,,Wide Selection of Food,4.0,,"If you want to taste different types of food in one place in Singapore, Lau Pa Sat is a great place to start. It's located in SG's central business district and is right across SGX. It's very hot and crowded during lunch or dinner. Getting a table might be difficult on peak hours."
,,Quick bite and lots of choices !,4.0,,Might not be the BEST food in Singapore but it was quite nice and very cheep if you are looking for dinner in the area and cant be bothered walking too far you should give it a go
,,Food food food food ........and also some food,5.0,,"Yum , ........this is simple , there are so many different wonderful Singapore foods available here that if you dont eat here ...........You Are Bonkers ! . But wait there is more .....at night they close one of the streets ......and have Satay stalls ..................simply brilliant .....nuff said."
,,Oliver all the different cuisines,4.0,,"Had the fried oyster omelette 30 years ago, even better this time round. So much to choose from, lots of people."
,,Cheap place to eat,5.0,,"Our taxi driver recommended this place to eat. How glad we listened. The array of food stalls was surprising. Deciding what and where to eat was a problem but what a problem!
The food was so tasty we ate here on both our nights in Singapore."
,,Lovely!,5.0,,"We loved Lau Pa Sat and visited it a couple of times. The hawker centre is famous (and also more highly priced because of it), but it is still very good value and the variety and quality of food is great. Will visit again."
,,Easy place to find low cost meals,5.0,,So glad I found Lau Pa Sat this trip to Singapore. Eating out became very easy and very very tasty. The variety of food here is mind blowing so be prepared to spend 15 minutes before you eat walking around and taking in a variety of options. I couldn't go past the chicken rice on my first visit.
,,Great place to eat traditional foods,4.0,,"Offers a range of foods at good value prices. It's a bit like a food hall with a wide range of cuisines on offer and worked well for us - visiting from UK - because it was all very visual in terms of seeing what was being prepared and what was on offer. The eating area is reasonably clean, tables are cleared quickly and there are fans to help circulate the air."
,,Modern Asias answer to tapas on a large scale,4.0,,Communial eating area with a large variety of very tasty food from Japanese to Thai to Indian to pizzas. There is literally something for everyone. I enjoyed a beautifully flavoured green Thai chicken curry with rice for only $5 with a good sized portion. My son had pepperoni pizza and my partner chicken curry. Most stalls do taster portions of several smaller dishes for a set price which is excellent is you want to complement your curry for example with a vegetable curry and naan with huge amounts of pilau rice. All the locals swing through here on their way home from the yum or work so it gets super busy at about 6pm.
,,"Huge range of tasty, cheap food.",4.0,,"Enjoy almost any type of Asian food you can imagine plus I saw some kiosks with western-style dishes. S$5-S$10 per dish in a busy food hall. Definitely worth a visit for the good-value, yummy food and the atmosphere."
,,A must do,5.0,,We were advised not to miss this and are we glad we did. What a fantastic atmosphere and great Satays. Suitable for all
,,A clean place to experience hawker food,4.0,,"Although it has lost some of it's charm after refurbishing , if you are an expat,head here to see asian food variety in one place.
If you are a local or from this region, there are better places to eat.

Satays on road side are a treat.
Place can get really hot and sticky as there is no ac,
Come prepared with wet cloth to keep cool or down ice cold beer!"
,,Good,3.0,,It is nice to see how they have redone the inside and kept so much of the original metal work of the original area. The food was good. Late at night many of the stalls are closed and you have a small selection of where to eat. Some areas were not very clean. The stack of dishes waiting to be washed was in plane view. Not for us but it was a great hang out for others. You can get there after enjoying all the business area sights.
,,Come here to have some nice food,5.0,,"The best Oyster Omelette so far I had compare to years ago, when I had the best in Newton Circles which no longer have a good oyster omelette. Here there is a stall which serve crispy outside juicy inside this oyster omelette. You cannot miss this stall and it is a MUST TRY"
,,SATAYS!!,5.0,,"We ate here most nights, due to a Satay addiction of a family member. Apparently there is other food too, ha ha...but we didn't get past the satays or the chilli crab....its a must do!!"
,,Lau Pa Sa tFood Market,5.0,,"Open 24 hours a day. If its sate your after, don't go until after 7pm. They close a side street off for the sate vendors. 30 sticks for $22. mix of beef, chicken and mutton. Ask for extra sause, cause if your like me, you will want it. Great sago desserts inside and fruit juices galore, plenty of cold beer as well. Easy access via SMRT. Eat yourself silly."
,,Satay!!!!!!!,5.0,,"I have never experienced the smells and aroma of satay like I did here. Ok, the stools are old and dirty, it is hot and sweaty, the different salespeople are a little pushy and loud. But it didn't matter one bit once the grileld skewers of chicken, lamb and prawns turned up. So succulent, juicy and well cooked - accompanied with the best peanut sauce I have ever had. You just have to visit."
,,Miss the old look,3.0,,"I miss the old look before renovation. New look is clean, too modern. Food is average in general. Some good stalls nonetheless. Getting more expensive... :("
,,"Hot, crowded and over rated",2.0,,"all food places have a B grade rating, the water being sold is expensive and room temperature, it is a super hot environment and not a nice place to eat"
,,An different kind of an evening,4.0,,We visited this with no knowledge with what to expect and were pleasantly surprised with what it had to offer. Plan to have an evening meal or dinner there. Be adventures and explore local cuisine.
,,Food Festival,4.0,,"Lots of food variety. Just make sure to be early so you can grab seats, oh and by the way, make sure to have your own tissue. :)"
,,Hawker area with refurbished building,5.0,,"An historic part of Singapore that has been refurbished yet keeps it hawker focus. Many varieties of food, all good, all cheap. Night time satay evenings are worth going for."
,,Sizzling smoky satay,3.0,,"This is the third time we've been here in recent years, and despite the refurbishment to the inside of the pavilion, what most (tourists anyway) really go for is the satay hawker stalls on the outside.
On our most recent visit it was raining so everyone was very crowded inside. No problem as the touts will find you a table, even if you have to share, it's all part of the fun. We didn't know one from another and they all seemed to look the same so went with the first who nabbed us, No 6. The satay took a while to arrive but we were plied with cheap beer in the meantime.
It cost S$21 for 30 (very small) sticks of mixed satay and a beer. That was plenty for 2 people.
The smell of the satay when they put it in front of us was divine - smoky, caramelized and mouth watering. Unfortunately the satay was cold and the meat was really tough. We were very disappointed but would still come again and try another stall.
This is a fun, cheap place to eat and we'd definitely give it another go."
,,Superb street food experience satay hut number 3/4,5.0,,"Had our first dinner tonight on the street. Fabulous platter of assorted satay. Huge plague of king prawns. Veg superb as were noodles. Lots off locals eating with us so a good sign. Food tasted good, service good too, good value, highly recommend."
,,"Easy lunch, good value",4.0,,"This place was across the road from our hotel. It has lots of options and we were able to get a table during lunchtime on a weekday. Paid <S$6 per meal! Delicious and authentic. Also had ""Western"" meals but why would you when the local options are so great?"
,,Night life of Singapore,4.0,,"BBQ, String Rays, Drink At night closed the street and many tables appear. Just order whichever you want and feel the atmosphere of Singapore as local."
,,Good Hawker Food,5.0,,Lau Pa Sat is in an old market building which is constructed of cast Iron shipped from England to Singapore for the market building and moved a few times to this CBD location. It is worth a visit fro this but the selection of Hawker food ranges thru Chinese Malay and Indian and all at reasonable prices.
,,Great eating out venue,4.0,,"Chili Crab was amazing, Also loved the dim sum and satay ! I ate here about 2 times during my 5 day stay !"
,,Biggest Food Court,4.0,,It is the biggest food court in Singapore. Has all types of food available. Great if you are a vegetarian. At late hours the stalls on the roads also open up.
,,Nicely refurbished,4.0,,The refurbishment completed in the last few years has really updated and made this a nice food court. The Satay in the street beside starting at 7pm has lots of choices and of course the interior has many food choices of many different food types. There is no shortage of vendors touring around the tables. The beer is not bad at S$18.50 happy hour and S$20 after
,,Lots of variety & good eats!,5.0,,"Great variety of food, from satay sticks to soups, noodles, curries the list is endless. Great atmosphere if you're into that real communal style eating - it's crowded but you get your own table. Loved the food and the place! Will be back."
,,YUMMY!,5.0,,"As this was right across the street from our hotel we visited a few times. Of the hawker centres we visited this was my favourite, mainly down to the choice of food and the proximity to satay street. Often we'd start the evening with some satay before heading inside for the main event. Our favourite was the big meal (from a think stall 10?)"
,,Changes every time,5.0,,First visited in 1997 then in 2009.keeps changing but the food is still great and very much a local haunt.Excellent value for money.
,,variety of dishes to choose from all in one place,4.0,,i have gone to singapore twice already and we always eat here. i love thier chicken rice and the skewers at night. the prices are very affordable and worth it. one order is already very filling. the vendors are very nice too. the place is very clean though one thing i have learned during my stay in singapore would be to always have a pack of tissues or wet wipes handy since they don't usually give.
,,A great Hawker centre with an array of food options,4.0,,"If you're in search of a good hawker market, Lau Pa Sat is a good one! Not only is it situated next to Boon Tat St (the night satay market), this hawker offers a variety of fresh food at dirt cheap prices."
,,Best place for food lovers,4.0,,Good time to visit this place is at late night. A side is blocked and turned into an open restaurant at night. Nice place to consume seafood and unique Singaporean and Malay foods. Famous for Satay.
,,Lovely Place,3.0,,"Good place for Food varieties , in the centre , good quality of food , good price , you will find different food : Thai , Malay , Fish , Meat , Vegetarian"
,,Great food .,5.0,,Lau Pa Sat means Old Market in the local language. This place have some really good local food like the Satay and Teh Tarik and many other local delights. Very highly recommended best is during evening.
,,Good hawker spot,3.0,,We headed down to the hawker market after hearing all the great reviews and it was a bit of a let down. The food is good but nothing particularly special. Its more of an interesting place to have a look at what local fare is like if funds are limited.
,,Nice location for a quick taste of Singapore,4.0,,Hundreds of street vendors gathered in one place allow anyone to sample a few tastes of Singapose food. Ideal for a short layover. 20 min by taxi from airport. Vendors are inspected and thus clean and safe.
,,24 hour food court,5.0,,"Lau Pa Sat is a regular favorite amongst locals and visitors alike. The food court has many food stalls that sell a variety of food, including local delicacies to western ones."
,,So many choices,5.0,,"I dont know how to help you here, we had a food from a few different stalls and we were all happy so I guess just have a look around and pick what you like"
,,"Inside is good, outside in the evenings is better",4.0,,A large food pavillion with lots of choices. But outside in the evenings it comes alive as the home to the Satay club. My favorite place for grilled sticks of meat in peanut sauce and cold Tiger beer with friends.
,,"Excellent, Excellnet, Excellent",5.0,,"This is a great place to expereince a Singapore Hawker style food hall. Lots of great food choices, great atmosphere and cheap. Great location with access to nearby MRT lines or afterwards walk down to Marina Bay to enjoy the nightly light show and Merlion."
,,I loved this place.,5.0,,I loved this place. Locals and tourists eat here at this sort of huge food court featuring very reasonably priced foods from all over the Asian world (and even Costa rican too). So yummy...could have eaten here for days. A bit chaotic...totally worth it. And they close the outside street for satay...great energy...my favorite was stall 6 for satay. Whole family found unique and amazing food. Loved it. My favorite dining place in a long time.
,,Great for a quick bite,5.0,,"Huge range of choice but you have to have the satays when they set up on the street once all the offices close.

There are better places out of town but set right in the financial district this is a great place to start your hawker experience."
,,Great Hawker Center,5.0,,If you are in Singapore for even 2 hours you need to go here!!! Start inside with some noodle or dumplings but make sure you make it outside. The real gem of this spot is the satay. Skip stalls 7 and 8 and order from #6. Much better service!!!! The beef and shrimp is so good. Minimum order is 10 pieces but trust me you'll want at least a dozen pieces.
,,Various food choices,5.0,,Been here twice already. I always drop by in my visits. Its a good place to hang out with friends too.
,,Rip off for tourists,3.0,,"Well, if you have nothing to do while on transit ... sure, why not. That said, its expensive ... and while it reopened to some fanfare 1-2yrs ago ... some of those stalls have since closed down."
,,Good dinner choice,4.0,,One of many hawker centers in Singapore and a good choice for an inexpensive meal. Choose from one of a great many stalls (I went with the curry from an Indian place) and sit at a communal table. Easily reached from the MRT and convenient to walk from there to the Marina and Gardens by the Bay afterwards.
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Lau Pa Sat used to be a wet market long time ago and was converted to a hawker center with lots of choices and varieties. There are also some small shops selling souvenirs.

It is casual dining here and the prices of the food are not very expensive. You will have to order the food at the stall of your choice and bring your own food to the table.

The building architecture was of British colonial stye and was renovated recently to preserve its character.

Even though it is touristy here, it is still a good place to visit and experience the local street food."
,,Satay!,4.0,,Great place. Lots and lots of varieties. The satay stalls open up at night. Would definitely come back again. Find a spot under one of the big fans overhead to keep cool
,,Could well be the best food in SG,5.0,,"Definitely one of my favorites since I went there for the first time in 2013. The satay that are served in the evenings on the closed street are simply delicious. The entire atmosphere in the area created by the vintage building, amazing smells and smoke lifting up from the satay surrounded by the modern skyscrapers is astonishing, one of a kind place! Their desserts are great as well. Oh, and beer. Definitely recommend, especially in the evenings when the street is closed and they take the satay to the streets, quite literally."
,,"Satays, Satays Satays",4.0,,The only reason to come here is Satays. There are a few different outfits that will try to sell you their satays (because they are the best). They will even deliver to where you are sitting. Luckily we had a large group so we ordered the largest order of Satays and they threw in some rice patties. Worth a visit to see the Satay Vendors cooking outside
,,Bustling,4.0,,"We had seen this on the bus tour and after having cocktails nearby decided to try and find it.
The original appeal was its history, it was built as a food market and is a true singapore landmark, it was moved from its original location but kept many of its original details.
It is now a hawker centre delivering many kinds of local and international foods.
We tried the chicken satay...how they cook over the flaming coals in extreme temperatures I will never know, but this was a great experience in a beautiful building."
,,Cheap food,5.0,,"Cheap and varied food, in the centre of the city, so easy access. From MRT. Lovely cake shop on the outside of it as well."
,,Variety + Low Cost,4.0,,"One would be spoilt for choice on the food front here. Variety of cuisines from different parts of the world at low prices makes it a great place to have your meal!

May get crowded during lunch time, as the place is accessible from a good number of offices nearby."
,,Classy hawker centre in the CBD,4.0,,Recently renovated this hawker centre is more upmarket than the others and serves the affluent CBD. It is justifiably packed at lunchtimes and the choice of foods is unrivalled and includes all the local delicacies as well as food from further afield and even a French patisserie. It is next to Satay Street (officially Boon Tat Street) a busy road which closes at seven every evening and becomes an open air satay eatery ....best satay in Singapore and a pretty good roti prata vendor too. Drink Tiger beer served by the Tiger Aunties to really feel like a local!
,,Such a fun spot!,4.0,,"I wish I lived right next to this place!
I'd go everyday!
I love the variety! Most of it is really well priced too.
I love the beautiful old building!
I wish it weren't so hot though! Not a lot to be done about that in Singapore!"
,,Nice experience,3.0,,We have read about these hawker centers so we wanted to try one. Lau Pa Sat was just across our hotel . The food was good and reasonably priced. We were surprised to see people who were dressed in formal clothes also eating there.
,,Food paradise.,4.0,,"People always say satay is famous here. But you can get many variation of foods. Thai, western, indian, etc... The food are reasonable price. Having lunch is little difficult because of crowd. After evening the small road is closed. Worth for having lunch and dinner here."
,,Best Satay Ever,5.0,,YUMMMM.... you have to visit here after dark. The joining street cloeses to traffic and becomes an instant outdoor restaurant. The Pavilion is full of food stalls and the street is full of outdoor BBQ stalls cooking all sorts of Satay sticks. Soo many to choose from but we choose stall 7/8 which had lots of reviews. You order the meat / protein you want and the quanity. The two of us ordered chicken and beef and they were cooked and brought to us with large containers of dipping satay. Great atmosphere full of buzz and excitment. Glad we ventured here
,,Great satay,5.0,,I was recommended to come here for satay and so glad that we went. Food is fantastic and cheap. Great atmosphere as well.
,,Lau Pa Sat (Festival market),4.0,,"If you are fed-up with eating in closed ambience or do not like the typical hawker food while in Singapore & want to smell the barbeque food while sitting in the middle of the road next to Singapore Exchange building (after late evenings only) & want to catch-up with friends over a beer (only) or any other popular locally available hot or cold drink then just visit.
This a huge place with several outlets & common sitting similar to a non-aircon food court which remains open almost throughout the day (and night). It is central to Singapore & stone’s throw away from most of the famous banks & offices adjacent to Robinson road & walking distance from Raffles place MRT (exit F). The sea front too is walking distance.
Food is variety of items which means all sorts of local food, Chinese, Malay, Indian, Vietnamese, Filipino, Korean, Japanese, Vegetarian, sea food etc. You just name it.
There is a convenience store (Cheers) & few enclosed aircon places as well if you fancy a bit of exclusivity. This is a popular meeting place of InsightSuite with local friends as well as overseas visitors. Try it & if you like it I am sure you will get hooked."
,,Best food in Singapore,4.0,,"Very good food at very reasonable prices, very clean and wheel chair friendly, just be sure to be dropped off near a ramp. The service not as personable as I would normally expect in Singapore, some stall holders were quite abrupt and without etiquette. However, the food, price and ambience of the old market make it a worthwhile visit."
,,Street food at its best,4.0,,"If you come to Singapore you need to visit Lau Pa Sat after dark, the outside street normally busy with cars is transformed into a chaotic but yet organized feast of satay sticks. Be ready to be approached by dozen of waiting staff to try and get you to sit down at their stalls, each one with different variant of busyness and pricing. Some of the stalls sell a variety of satay sticks at individual prices whilst others provide set menu styles. We ordered from Stall 7/8 which seems to have had the most accolades and they offered a set menu which was fine giving us a sample of chicken, beef and prawn. You can literally spend all night going from stall to stall and tasting the variety of sauces, protein and styles. We ate satay sticks elsewhere in Singapore but none compared to these"
,,Variety food to choose,4.0,,"Variety of local foods you able to taste here, had ordered a Hainan Chicken rice and stay, both of them taste well!! Recommended."
,,Great food variety and cheap prices,5.0,,"Leave this place hungry , it's your own fault. Laksa, noodles, fish balls, curries, and more. Average price $10 Sing Dollars"
,,Probably the Best Variety and Selection,5.0,,"Of all the hawkers I've been to, this has the best variety in my opinion. The prices may be slightly higher than the local neighborhoods but it's still decent pricing. There is the Lau Pa Sat in the street that starts at 7pm every night. I think this is more in reference to the pavilion. I do recommend the street satay although they stalls are pushy and so annoying. But inside the pavilion, there is everything from the typical Indian, Dumplings, Drink Stalls, Carrot Cake, and all those stalls. But it also has so many more cuisines. I can't remember them all but I do remember seeing many kinds that I haven't seen anywhere else such as Costa Rican. But the one stall that I highly recommend is the Thunder Rice stall and order the number 1. I think that's about it. I kind of want to knock down the rating because I hate being heckled. There will be people constantly putting napkins in your face wanting to buy them. I hate it because they get in your face and disrupt the conversation at your table. And also the street satay people are so aggressive that it's annoying. Like if I don't look at you or your stall, leave me alone. I won't go into details but let's just say that it's ridiculous all the situations for which I was heckled to buy satay (like if I'm carrying satay, then I don't want more. Why would they heckle me if I already have it). Anyways, I do love the food and I will probably get Thunder Rice on every visit to this place. If you do satay in the street at 7pm, you might be able to walk down to Marina Bay for the 8pm light show which I highly recommend. We've done that a few times now."
,,Singapore Trip 2016,4.0,,"You have to go here for Satay, the street is blocked off at 7pm and comes alight with people eating Satay, price about 70 cents a stick, just great, to eat and relax, and Satay goes well with a cold beer,"
,,For excellent local food for reasonable prices near the marina,5.0,,"Lau Pa Sat is one place to go for true local food, authentic, not so pricey and close to Marina bay. Dont forget to try the Singaporean Chilli crab."
,,lots of food,4.0,,"This market was right opposite our hotel and the road was closed off and filled with tables and chairs in the evening. Loads of stalls selling all sorts of food including some vegetarian options for us, mostly Indian food for the vegetarians. There are one or two proper restaurants around the square as well as the stalls."
,,Fantastic Street Food,4.0,,"Visited Lau Pa Sat and had dinner ( stall 8)
Absolutely fantastic feed and although I have been during the day time to markets I would rate night food better.

I would recommend going I set up in size for your order.

Also order beer yourself if you want quick service as things if a night are hectic."
,,"Easy, fun and cheap",4.0,,"Nothing exceptional but food is decent, cheap and easy to grab. Can be very hot and stuffy so sit below fans. A lot of variety."
,,"Do eat here, highly recommended.",5.0,,"We always have at least one meal here when we visit Singapore. There are so many food vendors to choose from such an amazing choice of different foods. Very, very clean, a lovely atmosphere with everyone chattering and it is always s busy....that says it all for me, people know it is good food and so cheap."
,,Look no further for your dining experience,5.0,,"Dozens of stall holders present their food offerings in a pavilion that leaves your taste buds salivating. I would doubt if anyone could leave this place not having their appetite satisfied. The meals are very cheap but very tasty, and you can watch them being prepared in case you are hesitant about hygiene in the preparation. Not all the stall holders are happy smiling people, but I guess it has been a long day for many. You can dine inside the pavilion or outside on the perimeter. It is a favourite of the locals which is always a good sign"
,,Hawker Food Center (financial district),5.0,,One of the best food court in Singapore--it is a must do for great food from every country in Asian. Outstanding. Great for families. Lots of people but worth it. Very reasonable
,,A nice place for a good variety of local cuisine,4.0,,"I work nearby and have been to Lau Pa Sat a few times in the last one year. For visitors who are keen to try some local cuisine, this is an easy one-stop shop. This is a hawker centre so you can pretty much find most local dishes that you can think of (except possibly chilli crab unfortunately). However, if you're visiting during weekday lunch, be prepared to put up with large crowds. This place isn't air conditioned either but had decent ventilation due to the high roofs."
,,Great food experience in Singapore,4.0,,"The so-called Hawker Centres in Singapore were the result of the Government's desire not to have stalls littering the streets. Although it sounds a bit authoritarian, in fact it has led to some really excellent centres where the food quality is high and the health standards are maintained by frequent inspections. As at Newton Circus, some of the stall holders can be a bit too pushy, but it's easy to ignore them and feast from your choice of stalls. The black carrot cake I had from one stall was ok, but not as good as I've experienced at Newton. Overall, however, the complete under-cover seating is a plus when the weather is unpredictable."
,,Nice but not traditional,4.0,,"Very nice set up, right in the heart of the CBD. Stall are of good quality, with prices much higher than other food court. If you visit the place, go by night, to see teh amazing show of satay in the back street."
,,Crowded yet satisfying,5.0,,"Food choices are a plenty, but filipino stalls are closed already by dinnertime. Satay everywhere, crew of stalls will even try to speak tagalog if they know you are filipino."
,,Great food for everyone,4.0,,Everyone will enjoy this place. Plenty of different cuisines to enjoy and sample. They also have satay evenings on saturday night which was fantastic. The lemon drink and mango ice dessert was delicious as well as the chicken satays
,,Must visit hawker centre,4.0,,"Middle of the CBD, street on the side will be closed for traffic from 1800 hrs and a instant hawker centre is set up, must place to visit, enormous diversities in inexpensive food, plenty of drink stalls, beer stalls coconut drinks, you name it, its there !!!
Open till LATE !!!!!"
,,Every single type of singapore food available here,5.0,,"If you are a foodie and have only one night in Singapore, this is the place to be. You can literally find ANY and every kind of local food here, at local rates. Word of warning: dress lightly as it can get really warm!"
,,Great food at interesting place,5.0,,I had a pleasure to grab something to eat at Lau Pa Sat this month. I regretted that I've ate something earlier and I couldn't have more at LPS. Beside tasty food the atmosphere is also extraordinary. Having a chance to eat on a main street under skyscrapers is not something that you are doing daily...
,,Tourist Trap pricing - food as one would expect in Singapore - very good,3.0,,"Eating in the street with satays made on the spot naturally delivers quality and tastes that one couldn't get in a sit down restaurant with satays - they have to be eaten from the fire.
Pricing was ridiculous $54 for 24 satays - especially when you know this is not the correct price. Also $29 for 2 medium plain roti breads was extortion"
,,Taste buds in overdrive,5.0,,"Though I might just give an update on everyone's favourite dining experience - Singapore Satay.
Got a taxi ($10 from our hotel so don't bother getting all hot and sweaty walking!)
Wandered through the Lau Pa Sat Festival pavilion enjoying the smells of all the various cuisines on offer before heading towards the back of the pavilion to where all the satay stalls are situated. You can't miss them, just follow your nose.
There are loads of various stalls all numbered and the prices are much the same.
We chose stall 7 ( bypass the touts as you can never be sure which stall holder they are touting for and approach your chosen stall holder yourself).
Find a place to sit close by , lots to chose from. We ordered the bundle of 10 chicken satay sticks, 10 beef and 6 jumbo prawns. We also ordered a pitcher of beer which was I guess equivalent to about 2 pints as I had 2 glasses and my husband about 2+.
Just watching the satay being cooked is an experience in itself.
The satay arrived sizzling hot and accompanied by little cubes of cucumber, raw onion and 2 good sized bowls of satay sauce for dipping. The satays were $26 and the beer $19.
Hopefully we'll get another opportunity to visit there again before heading home, if not it's a good excuse to come back to Singapore!"
,,Unhygienic and crowded place,2.0,,+ Lot of food options Running crowd during lunch hours - You can see died cockroaches outside the pavilion Difficult to find place to sit at times
,,Well priced good food just two MRT stops from Marina Bay,5.0,,We visited around 10 pm on a Tuesday night. Half the stalls were still open and plenty of people were looking for great food. Great atmosphere and well ventilated. Everyone found something yummy to eat at cheap prices considering the area. We also hung around outside afterwards just taking in the movement of the people along with the skyscrappers and lights and sounds of the night.
,,Lots of choices,3.0,,"The location is not far from Raffles Place MRT. Lots of food choices (western food, Indian food, Chinese food, Indonesian food). We select the Ayam Bakar (Indonesia and halal food) price of about 5 Dollar Singapore, tastes good and steady spiciness."
,,fantastic,5.0,,"The thing I love about Singapore is the easy and cheap access to great food. This one is in the centre of the city. There is a huge range and food servings are generous. Recommend the kway du, and the laksa. I can't remember the names of the stalls but you can't go wrong. My laksa was $5 and there was also an $8 option. The $5 option was plenty for me.

I also went to Smith Street in Chinatown which has gone a bit touristy since my last trip and is more expensive (but still cheap by western standards)."
,,must-do in Singapore,5.0,,"The food may not be hoity-toity gourmet, but it is good as evidenced by the throngs of Singaporeans eating lunch there every day. A treat, with dozens of options from all the walks of Singaporean life."
,,Food court,5.0,,Really loved the Indonesian Stall 'I Love Food' the spicy red chicken was so tasty with coconut & spice! Beautiful The market building is clean & historic! Big Ben is heard on the hour.
,,Great Selection of Food,4.0,,"A large in door hawker centre with a good variety of cuisines. Some persistent vendors chase you round with their menus, ignore them and make your own choice. Great Chicken Buns and good value compared with Newton."
,,Great! Do yourself a favour and visit,5.0,,"Lau Pa Sat, also known as Telok Ayer, is the best of the hawker big food court/eateries in our opinion, for food flavour, choices and the venue, when compared to Maxwells, Tanjung Pagar Plaza, 100AM mall -food court Koufu.
It is located on Anson rd, and not far from Telok Ayer station. Whilst open all the time the evening meal is the time to go. Outside are the satay stalls. Cooks sweating over their grills with foot high flames. The satays are cheap (70c) and you can individually or in any size bundle you wish. From there you wander inside to all the stalls. This is where the hard part starts. There are so many choices you will spend some time searching for what you wish to eat. We recommend buying a dish and sharing one at a time, and trying as many as you can eat. The budget will not suffer, as food is cheap. The Dim Sum stall has prawn dumplings to die for. The Indian curry and naan bread also was great. Really all the food is good, and you can’t go wrong. Most meals are about the $4 mark, Dim Sum cheaper.
The building is about 100 years old and has been renovated, and the ambience is great.
Definitely recommend eating here."
,,Satay / Stingray,5.0,,"Best place in town for local food , i prefer satay and stingray , order satay box 8 , best in town come there every trip to SG"
,,overated or not...,3.0,,"Went there may 2nd ....public holiday . Lot af stalls closed. Returned that night .a little busier. Satay street open and rocking. Full on touting for business.. satay stand 3&4 ok nothing special quick, tasty but over cooked. Inside a lot still closec. May re try later to see if different ."
,,Best sateh I ever had!,4.0,,"I went here on a Saturday evening at about nin o'clock to avoid the largest crowds. Still a busy place. The foods stands inside the building are nothing special and some guys inside advertise with ridiculously high prices for sateh that is almost for free if you get them yourselves at the 10 booths outside. I tried booths 7, 8, 9 and 10 and they are all very good. Nice peanut sauce too. I paid Sing $ 0,70 per stick. Very good!"
,,Dinner,4.0,,Dined here twice on our stay in Singapore. Very good chili crab at a reasonable price $40 for small. Satay was tasty and so was the stingray. Clean facilities. Will return later in the year on our next visit to Singapore
,,poor quality of foods,2.0,,"The place is nice. There are a lot of variety of stand and cooking style (dim sum, fish soup, curry...). Good for variorities but lack of qualities"
,,More Food!!!!!,5.0,,"I didn't quite go to Singapore just to eat food, but.........
This was just across the road from our hotel for part of our two week stay, so I had to do it justice and visit a few times.
First problem of going at night was that I had to cross what had now become Satay Street to get to it. The street was closed, with 15 Barbecue stalls all selling Satay, so the temptations made it difficult to cross the road to get to Lau Pa Sat!
But I persisted!
Choice of food from most Asian nationalities, freshly cooked in front of you normally. I fell in love with Laksa, a spicy noodle soup and on my final night had Singapore Crab. - It was, admittedly, 6 times the price of what my wife was eating and needed the pile of napkins that came with it, but was very tasty."
,,Great meal,4.0,,"Went to best satay stall 7&8 for beef, chicken and prawn skewers. Amazing satay sauce, spicy and flavoursome. Got rice cake to go with it. Also ordered Thai pineapple rice which was a bit sweet and amazing chicken pad Thai. Place not as busy as we expected and therefore lacked some atmosphere but food definitely delicious."
,,Best stay ever !!,5.0,,"Do yourself a favour and head here after 7pm to the satay barbecues at the back - go straight to stall 7&8 where you will be seated and given a laminated menu for satay sets.....or just order the type and quantity of sticks you prefer !! You can buy drinks inside and extra dishes or fried rice, etc to accompany !!! We love the satay stalls - just remember to bring your own serviette/tissues, or you can also by those in a packet for 50cents I think It's all good and tasty and a favourite place to go when we stop off at Singapore....xxx"
,,Good Food And Clean,4.0,,The food was good but I found the choices a bit limiting. The stalls are clean and comfortable. Try the curry puffs! Yum!
,,Touristy but nice,5.0,,grab your dinner and eat it on what used to be a pretty busy main road by day...must try the satay and the otah...and obviously grab a beer!
,,"Satisfaction Guaranteed, even for the picky-eater!",4.0,,"I am such a picky-eater : being at the finest restaurant does not guarantee that I'd find something I CAN eat and that I actually would enjoy eating. I was at first hesitant to try Lau Pa Sat because of this; and, also, because I am extremely squeamish. I do not like street food, much less, open space food stalls along the streets. So when my friend told me this is a hawker centre, I almost immediately said no.

BUT I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED AT ALL.

First, it caters to so many different cuisines, that even the pickiest eater like me will find something to eat. Second, the food tastes so good! I didn't expect them to be that flavourful, after being here for nearly 2 months. As almost everyone here is health-conscious, the cuisines here are usually less sweet or less salty as what I am used to. But in Lau Pa Sat, everything tastes as how I remember them from their origin countries! Authentic, tasty and really, really sumptuous!

It may not be a luxury place and yes, it's open along the streets but it's a whole lot cleaner than the other hawker centres I've been brought to by my friends and colleagues, this one is so clean and also comfortable enough that my friend and I sat there for hours chatting the evening away as though we were hanging out at a café or quaint coffee shop!

Bonus : if you happen to be price-conscious, Lau Pa Sat offers sufficient food serving at really cheap prices, than if you eat at a restaurant.

And you can even mix-and-match your meal just the way you want -- perhaps, a Japanese Katsu Don for your main meal, with a side of Tonkotsu Ramen and 4 pieces of Chinese Siew Mai Dimsum? Then for your second round, try out the local Chicken Rice, followed by Indian Curry and discover the taste of a Costa Rican chimichurri? Then get some Korean bingsu for dessert and several orders of fruit shakes from the centermost stall :)

Really, it's a place that will meet any type of tourist's wants and needs! And this is coming from someone who often cannot find a thing to eat, even in the buffet meals of luxury hotels."
,,Awesome food,5.0,,"This is a must-do while in Singapore, the food is great and very reasonably priced. Probably a little more expensive than other hawker centres but worth it because it's cleaner and larger than most. Recently refurbished so it's even better than before. Go."
,,Satay paradise,4.0,,"Satay stalls set up on the street outside Lau Pa Sat at 7pm week nights, earlier on the weekends. Grab yourself a fresh juice and choose from one of the many satay hawkers for a delicious fresh feast of chicken, beef or prawn cooked to perfection with tasty peanut sauces. We ate here two nights during our stay, it was so good. There are plenty of other food options inside, very popular on Friday nights when the workers come out from the surrounding office blocks. Raffles Place MRT close by."
,,Atmospheric,4.0,,"First visit and will return. Intended to go to Newton but it is closed for renovations. Great range of hawker style food at low cost. Chinese, Indian, Thai,Japanese, Malaysian etc so all boxes covered. Satay on offer from vendors set up in the street but I thought it was expensive and the staff pushy!! Anyway all in all a good experience."
,,Fantastic place!!!,5.0,,"There is lots of variety of foods, you will find the smell when you get close to the food Center, the price is quite low n affordable, though it's not air conditioning, you will find it comfortable sitting inside."
,,Visited every day for three months!,5.0,,"I lived opposite LPS during a secondment to Singapore. I ate here pretty much every single day. Food is in the main good quality and good value. The satay isn't great, and the sellers can get quite pushy but ignore them and push through inside to the proper stalls. Great place to go with friends as you can all eat different kinds of food with no problem. Now i'm back in the UK i miss this place already!"
,,Awesome food,5.0,,"Great hawkers centre and cheap. Sit outside and eat satay, seafood, rice and noodles. Easy to get a table and the stalls come to your table to take orders."
,,Little expensive but worth the visit,4.0,,"Lau Pa sat has recently been renovated so their prices went up a little. nevertheless, their satays (which are only served at night) are still great. they have varieties of food from local,japanese,vietnamese,chinese,western,costa rican, thai food.. etc."
,,Stick with satay street,4.0,,"Had a first time visitor to Singapore and the obvious choice was the Satay Street of Lau Pa Sat after the road closed at 7pm and benches and seats appeared out of no where.

My fave is stall 8 where the meats are a perfect blend of choice skewers of meat wtih the right amount of fat to keep them from drying out. When choosing which stall, feel free to ask to test the peanut sauce of each stall, they'll be happy to let you sample this vital condiment.

I love the mix of chicken, beef and pork but always steer clear of the prawn satay. They are NOT fresh and cooked from frozen and inevitably taste bland and mushy. PS. never ask the Beer girls for glasses of beer, which will never appear, only jugs as that's what they want you to buy. You'll need it anyway in steamy Singapore.

Satay street has never let me down."
,,great food and awesome environment,5.0,,"great range of food, good prices and great location. it is a good foodie tourist's intro into the singapore food scene"
,,Love it,5.0,,Great place with history and great food for very good prices. I eat there a lot as office is very close and its really good. Maybe too hot some days but overall is pleasant as its wide open and they have these giant fans. Recommend Anjapar Indian Food and also the Noodles Chef with delicious Noodles to order and his fried chicken.
,,Great for experiencing local satay,5.0,,I've taken a number of tourist here every time I go to Singapore. It's the best place in Singapore to experience authentic satay. The satay's open from 7:00 pm on the far side of the pavillion
,,Great casual place to eat - but prepared to get sweaty!,4.0,,Prepare yourself for a local delight! Sit on milk crates and bring your own napkins. But the food is good and it's a great place to mix with the locals. Satay is delicious!!!
,,A grest place to eat,5.0,,We were impressed by the huge variety of food at Lau Pa Sat as well as the beautiful old building that has been lovingly restored. Outside are a variety of satay stalls offering their tasty food. We will be back again sometime soon.
,,Yummy!!! Excellent Satay,5.0,,"The place to go if in Singapore and you want to eat Satay, visited last night with the family and got through 90 sticks of fantastic beef and chicken satay.

Why go anyplace else? Hawkers come past offering naan bread, drinks and even the old guy who has delivered tissues to the table for many years.

Magnificent!"
,,Authentic satays in a hawkers market setting,4.0,,"Having failed to walk the full distance from Marina Bay to Raffles Quay, I got a taxi and was whisked to Lau Pa Sat in no time at all for 10 Singapore bucks.

I walked through the hall where you can get a plethora of Asian delights at various Indian, Chinese and other oriental culinary focused stalls. But I was looking for the satay purveyors. A young lady armed with plastic menus spied me and escorted me out of the hall to a line of satay stalls. I installed myself on a ricketty plastic stool on ""Satay 7"" and quickly chose a set menu comprising various meat satays (chicken, lamb & beef) and a dozen or so large prawns. These came a few minutes later with two polystyrene containers of peanut sauce, a block of rice cake and a smattering of raw onions/cucumber. I wasn't so sure about the prawns until I realised that they had been de-shelled and were very easy to eat.

Another lady came to sell me beer at 5,00 Sing $ a mug. And an ancient old gentleman sold me some moist napkins for 2 bucks.

Having satisified my hunger I went bck into the hall to check it out and found myself buying some mango juice to complete my visit here.

I agree with other reviewers that this is a safe & clean place to experience real hawkers food. I loved it - you will too!"
,,Impressive range of cheap and delicious Asian cuisines!,5.0,,"Only a few mins walk from Raffles Place MTR. Lau Pa Sat offers such a wide variety of food there. Indian, Thai, Japanese, Korean, Chinese.. All very affordable, so much so, I had a little bit of a variety of different cuisines to see which I liked the most. Thai was the winner in my stomach! As well as this, there are desserts and drinks too.

Another point to add is that Lau Pa Sat had very high hygiene standards so no need to worry too much about cleanliness of food or surfaces.

A must go to place to eat in Singapore."
,,With Any food you want,4.0,,This pavilion was remodeled a few years ago and now contains all kinds of Asian food vendors. You can get anything you want here.
,,A must!,5.0,,This is a must for any foodie visiting Singapore. This is the bench mark of hawkers halls in Singapore. You could spend a month there trying all the delicious food on offer.
,,Excellent at night,5.0,,If you are a tourist in Singapore and don't go to Lau Pa Sat - you are made. Frantic and fun - find a table and choose your food. Go outside and they even bring it to you. The Singaporean style freah cooked seafood is a special treat!
,,FAVORITE LATE NIGHT HAUNT,4.0,,"We always end up at Lau Pa Sat after most late evening shows and are always happy with the bustling activity and happy foodies.
The building itself is a restored old-world marvel (Was once a wet market)
with high ceiling and antique looking large fans and lights.
The choice of food is so varied and almost every stall I've tried has always churned out the yummiest food.
When most of Singapore's night life, hawker centers and restaurants shut....There is always Lau Pa Sat to the hungry tummy's rescue!!"
,,Great place to eat when on a budget!,5.0,,"I love Lau Pa Sat Festival Pavilion! I was so glad this place was close to our hotel. If you are on a budget you need to try this place out. It's clean and there are plenty of food stalls to choose from. The food is great also. Check out the Satay stands that they have at night. The road is closed off to traffic by 7 pm and the satay stalls are set up! This is a must try! The satays are delicious. If I ever comeback to Singapore, this is a place I'll surely go back to!"
,,SATAY,4.0,,"Satay Street, BOONTAT STREET LAU PA SAT what ever you know it by it is very good, food is great and plenty of variety. you can get what you ant in side and take out into the street or stall owners have people to pester you to sit in their area (No 6 SATAY stall is my choice, plate of SATAY stick and a jug of Tiger or SINGHA beer happy days. If you do not like SATAY prawns get the stall owner to substitute for CHICKEN or LAMB or BEEF and you get a lot more because of the price of Prawns. The pestering of the wait staff is the only problem but adds to the atmosphere I guess, but remember it is hot in Singapore most of the time and it is hot in STAYA street. GOOD TIP take small wet ones with you, $2.00 bucks for tissues from the seller is not a big problem but wet ones do a better job at clean up time. Price is reasonable but you can get better prices in MAXWELLS hawker food court"
,,Food glorious food ! Great location and tons of satay 👍👍👍,5.0,,Found this gem on Trip Advisor before my first trip to Singapore. Some many stalls and cheap as cheap. Have a good look before choosing and ignore the touts ! Thai food here is very good.
,,Enjoy many food here,3.0,,"For budget I choose this place for dinner, you can choose so many variant food here and also satay at outside."
,,Sensational local food court,5.0,,"Had lunch and dinner at this open food court on my last trip. Great dishes from all around South East Asia (and some others). Obviously popular with the locals. This is a terrific place for someone finding their feet, interested to taste new foods. High quality, at very low prices."
,,Great experience,4.0,,"Amazing selection food, crazy atmosphere at lunch time in the CBD. Recommend for anyone travelling to Singapore. Tip: don't sit at an empty table with business cards on it - this is apparently a Singaporean thing, which means that owners of the said business cards will be back shortly to take their seats and eat...I found this out the hard way. It was all good, I moved a nearby seat where a local explained the unique little custom."
,,The best and the culturally diverse hawker center in Singapore,4.0,,"My review title says it all. You can practically find all the Asian varieties including local food, traditional Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Indian and some Italian and Mexican varieties in this hawker center. Located right in the heart of the CBD, this place caters to the taste buds of all the office going Singaporeans. There are a host of tea and coffee stalls as well."
,,Hawker in the CBD,3.0,,"Pros:
1. Location - very accessible and in the middle of the central business district so it's near to many attractions like the Merlion, Marina Bay, etc
2. Price - there's something for every budget.
3. Variety - as it is a hawker place, there are various cuisines available here. My personal favorite is the Costa Rican stall which offers authentic Costa Rican food (quite a novelty around here).

Cons:
1. Heat - the place has no airconditioning so it can be very warm at times.
2. Quality of food - as budget and cuisines are varied, food quality is also varied. Not everything is good so you might end up full but with unsatisfied taste buds."
,,Tasty food at very low prices!,5.0,,"There's a great selection of food to be found here from morning to night. We were in Singapore for 4 nights and our hotel was right by the food court so we came here for quite a few meals. For SGD$ 10-15 we were able to fill ourselves fairly easily, and most of the items we had were excellent. There are so many stalls its hard to make a dent in the list of choices, and the variety should cater to all tastes.

Best of all is the evening when satay street opens up. One of the roads alongside the food court is closed down and chairs and tables are laid out for the satay stalls that open up. This is a bustling table service enterprise that delivers a variety of satay dishes from competing vendors, all of whom are eager for your business. Definitely worth coming here at night to get in on the satay action!"
,,Good to know for the young.,3.0,,"Alot of pics for the Lau Pa Sat, it a good place for the young kids to visit to know the once a famous place during the old time and now also a place food of different type of food."
,,"Great food, good value",4.0,,"Four of us dropped into Lau Pa Sat for a late dinner after a few beers taking in the views at Marina Bay Sands. Talk about chalk and cheese! Food variety was awesome, good value pricing, we had a few dishes. It was probably starting to wind down for the night, so wasn't buzzing that much although diners in adjacent Satay Street were having a good time. Definitely worth a visit if you are in Singapore"
,,A little overrated,3.0,,I must admit I'm not enamoured of singapore street food and this is a bit of a tourist trap. Food quality extremely variable depending on which vendor you frequent. Service of the 'beer girls' appalling if you want anything non-alcoholic and some of the satay pushers can get terribly aggressive- and then fail to follow through with delivery of your order. Also being outside its hot and sweaty - doubly so if your on the satay cooking side.
,,Old Market,3.0,,"Lau Pa Sat or literally Old Market. It was market which same as common market is selling - vegetable, meat, dry food and of course cook food. Now Lau Pa Sat is just for cook food and during evening time, the street beside it - Boon Tat Street - will be closed for Satay stalls.From Monday to Friday, morning and noon is basically for the people working CDB for their breakfast and Lunch. Now, the evening is for tourist to taste Asian food at reasonable price to enjoy varieties."
,,Lovely dining,5.0,,"Definitely a perfect option to have good food at a good price in a nice and crowded place.It's a must to have the prawns and chicken satay, the best I ever had!And of course the chilli or pepper crab in Ming Yen, very fresh, and friendly staff.But there are many place to have diferent kind of food.Do really recomend to go."
,,Night Satays.,4.0,,"We love to come to Lau Pa Sat for the night Satays, and our out of towns visitors always have fun. The night satays opens after 7pm on a side street which they close off. The tables are set up plastic stools and beer jugs all come out. Its fun!"
,,"Old place, new look.",4.0,,"This place has been around for many years - built in 1894 and is gazetted one of Singapore's National Monument. Starting it's life as a wet market and now a ""modern hawker centre"" with a catchy name ""Festival Pavilion"". But to us, it will always be known as ""Lau Pa Sat"" which literally means ""old market"" in Fujianese dialect.

Lunch is usually crowded due to the sheer number of offices in the surrounding area. Unique to Singapore for the ""seat booking"" system whereby a call card or tissue packs (sometimes other objects like and umbrella) will be place on the table when it gets crowded. So for any tourists going to any foodcourts or hawker centre in Singapore for the first time, that means seats are taken.

Many food options to choose from here with local fare to even some Latin American food as well as other South East Asian, Japanese, Korean, South Asian (Indian) and even western food. In the evening, all the satay stalls opens and the crowd will be slightly different from the lunch crowd. Happy hour for a few pints of beer and supper for the late owls.

Economical, tasty and loads to choose from but we just wish more of the old charm of the market remains which unfortunately part of it's charm has been somewhat lost after the renovation to modernize it. At least the old clock is still there and still chimes every 15 mins, reminiscence of the old colonial charm."
,,great hawkers market,5.0,,"Fantastic place in Singapore for a great selection of good and cheap food. There are probably 25-30 different shops in this market with all sorts of food, so everyone will find something for just a couple of Dollars. Absolutely recommendable"
,,What a place,5.0,,"Vibrant, spolit for food choice, disappointing beers but the food more than made up for it. Don't let yourself be bullied by the hawkers, you can eat anywhere so you decide, not them"
,,Lost some of its charm after renovation,3.0,,"One of the more well-known Hawker Centers in Singapore. Extremely crowded during lunchtime on weekdays due to being one of the few lower priced food options in the CBD area. Plenty of different food. After renovation the look and feel is less authentic as before, which is a pity."
,,Lunch,3.0,,Convenient location close to the office. What I like about this place is the variety of food you can be eating a different cuisine every day. Quality is ok and you are generally paying below S$10 for lunch. Bad thing during lunchtime is it is always crowded so eat early or late if you do not like crowds. But it is worth a visit.
,,Delicious satay!,5.0,,Had dinner two nights here. The atmosphere and sitting out at a table on the street was wonderful. The satay was delicious!
,,Extremely Crowded!,4.0,,"When lunch time has come, this place will be extremely crowded with people and i barely find a spot to sit. But the good thing is there are so many kind of foods here, from asian to american style. All with affordable price."
,,Best Satay in Singapore,4.0,,"Stall 7 & 8 run by a lovely Lady called Ainon has the best Satay in Singapore as good as the Satay my husband and I had in Penang years ago.They close bottom of Boon Tat st after 6 every night and put out tables great atmosphere.Take wet wipes sometimes you get a box of paper seviettes but not always.Food hall is in old Victorian market but it is clean , toilets are fine and they have strict food hygiene laws in Singapore so food halls and Hawkers markets are good and cheap."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Loved the food there. Big variety , and very low prices (4$ lunch). Highly recommend it to try local foods."
,,I loved it,5.0,,Very nice morning and evening place for food stalls. All food there is safe to eat and under strict measures of hygiene. Try the delicious Singapore food but not the sea food which is better in sea food specialized restaurants.
,,Lots of food variety in historic building,4.0,,"It is original an old market place and now transformed to a food centre with many many choices of traditional local food. Enjoying those delicious food in such beautiful unique building is really a joyful experience. However, just one point to reminder the pricing level is much higher than other common food centres in other districts."
,,Historic building and lots of food options,5.0,,"We lived around the corner of Lau Pa Sat for 4 years, so we ate there all the time.

At one point, the octagonal, colonial building underwent a revamp. Some say for the better, others miss the old charm with it's rust and neglect.

There are lots of food options, most quite cheap.

Personally I like the sate area and eat al fresco in the designated, pedestrianized street (in the evenings).

From Lau Pa Sat you can walk to e.g. Chinatown, Marina Bay, Boat Quay and Clarke Quay."
,,My favourate traditional food area,5.0,,"Satay, seafood and cold Tiger beer, add the humidity and the touts finding you a table and taking your order, it couldnt be better. I often go by myself and just keep ordering satay and chilli squid until I can't move."
,,Love this place,5.0,,"For atmosphere and choice of dining, this cannot be beaten. Packed with locals, you have a vast choice of Far eastern and indian cuisine. All freshly cooked, juice bars, beer available, fantastic Satay stalls in the street at back of Lau Pa Sat."
,,Local seafood paradise & must try satay!,5.0,,"If you're in Singapore, one of the few places to go and eat will be lau pat sat! Local seafood dishes over there is superb & very satisfying. And if you're a fan of meat, satay is one of the other choices of food there! And yes it has the best satay over there! Must try!!"
,,Lots of options to explore,4.0,,I used to go to Lau Pa Sat quite often. Loved their fish and chips and some great Indian options to explore. The portion is quite big so be mindful.
,,"Nice area with many food stalls, but not really authentic any more",3.0,,"If you love food stalls, having your lunch or dinner outdoors in a nicely laid out site - this is the place to be. However, this place is mainly for tourists, so food may not be as authentic as you'd like it to be."
,,One of THE best places for food in SG,4.0,,"Great variety of food, very affordable prices, right in the heart of the CBD. No air conditioning, so it can get very warm, especially during lunch when it is crowded, but the food almost makes it worth it."
,,Lau Pa Sat is Foodies Paradise,5.0,,"La Pa Sat is my number one pick when it comes to Hawkers centres in Singapore with its huge variety of dishes and one of the best places to eat the Cities most famous dish Chilli Mud Crab , I go to Ming Yen Seafood in the pavilion it's located at the back where the streets are blacked off , the centre offers a range second to none with its variety of food , it's a clean centre and we have eaten a lot of food here and always no issues , prices are good as well so if you are in Singapore for even a short time please try this centre you won't be disappointed"
,,Night Satay worth a visit,4.0,,"We visited this historic night satay markets on a Saturday night and the atmosphere was lovely and lively. The Satay sticks were delicious, although I was surprised the normal Singapore rating system and regulation did not seem to be evident. At least 20 percent of our sticks had very little meat on them and as you pay per stick pretty disappointing."
,,"Yummy, Yummy , Yummy",5.0,,"We fell in love with this place. Both me and my hubby love eating different kinds of food and this street has one of the best street foods. We liked it so mach that we kept going to this place two days in a row. The satay is must try , from stall no 7 and 8.
I like the variety of food inside too. We tried chilly crab here for first time too. It was tasty.
Must visit if you are a tourist in singapore"
,,Khana Khazana,4.0,,One of the biggest Resto market where you can find lots of varieties in foods. Most of People come down here on lunch time to get theor lunch and then they get back to their work. One of the busiest place ever i have seen on the afternoon. Should be here and try some Chinese Foods. Enjoy
,,It is good place to eat.好吃有趣的景點.,4.0,,"這兒是一個大量食物聚集的地方,也是吃燒烤沙爹的地點,附近是金融區,高樓大廈鄰立.有趣的是,一到晚上7點整,會將整段路封起來,擺上桌椅,就成了戶外的餐飲地.There were so many foods and it's the place to eat satay. It's near the Financial District and a lot of high buildings. After 19 o'clock, closed the street, put the chairs and tables on, you could eat satay outside. It's so interesting."
,,A good place to eat!,4.0,,Company dinner from top executives to the lower on the rung. Everyone eats/drinks the same! what a great bonding moment.
,,not as authentic as I would have liked,4.0,,"Very cool colonial building with a ton of food choices. Most looked quite good, but we had hpoped for a lot more authentic Singaporean food. We did have very good indian food though at Urban Roti"
,,"Good food, lots of choices",4.0,,"Cool open food court in a historic site. There was a stall selling the cheapest beers I found in the area, and all the items I tried (Laksa, Kway Chap, and Pig's Organ Soup) were all tasty, satisfying and reasonably priced. They also have stalls selling Vietnamese, Taiwanese, Filipino, Chinese, Japanese, and even Italian and Turkish food."
,,A Lot Better Now,5.0,,We used to go here a few years ago but it was slowly falling apart in more ways than one. Not now! It's back on our must do list when we are back in Singapore. Food selection is great and good to see all of the Hawkers stalls are occupied and clean.
,,Great place to eat,4.0,,"This is like an up-market hawker complex. We went for chilli crab and beer - we were going to get messy so decor was not critical! Lots of different food options (although we couldn't find the satay which others wrote about). We were there at lunch time, so it was full of office-workers. Definitely worth a visit"
,,Fantastic atmosphere,5.0,,"Amazing food, cheap beer and a wonderful atmosphere. Try to get there ( about 6:30 pm) to watch the road closure - very funny."
,,Hawker markets,4.0,,Great place for cheap food. Good atmosphere but be prepared for sellers to be really pushy. Mainly satay available. Other dessert stalls around.

,,Hawker markets,4.0,,Great place for cheap food. Good atmosphere but be prepared for sellers to be really pushy. Mainly satay available. Other dessert stalls around.
,,Good place and good taste,4.0,,"Lau pa sat could be one of the dining options in Singapore, there are many variants of food, for you were Muslims do not worry, because there is available food that you can eat .. to reach there you can use towards Raffles Place MRT and out of the exit I .. so, enjoy your holiday.."
,,Satay,4.0,,"Satay street by night , very good.lots of local food and all the satay you can eat by night.Good service and plenty of options. Very busy as very popular. Would certainly visit this spot again. We had five kids with us and that wasnt a problem"
,,Great night with beer and satay.,4.0,,"A fabulous experience in the evenings to have a couple of beers with a huge plate of satay, or any other type of food you desire.
It is not air-conditioned and the funkiest seating opens up at 7pm when they block off the street near all the food carts and set up a heap of tables and chairs."
,,Satay Street,5.0,,"From 7pm every night Lau Pa Sat ""Satay Street"" (part of Lau Pa Sat Festival Market) is closed off and the smell of barbecue smoke fills the air.

The crowd swells quickly and settle in for satay skewers of chicken, lamb, pork, and prawns cooked on charcoal fires. Tiger beer is offered regularly and the atmosphere is fantastic.

There are many stalls and you will probably find your personal favorite. Often recommended are stalls 7, 8 and 10. For me I enjoyed stall 9 with Sonny providing helpful and friendly service.

If you're out and about at night in Singapore I consider this a must visit."
,,Better hawker centres out there but I guess a must for tourists,3.0,,"After being closed for a year, LPS has reopened and it is a bit too polished - feels like a shopping mall food court and managed by a large company. It's not mom and pop making their family recipe. At lunch time during the week it is chaos - too hot and no where to sit with all the office workers there. It's better in the evening although not all shops are open. The highlight is the open air satay street right beside it and for those who don't want satay, they can grab some of the 'hawker' food inside. Prices are definitely more expensive since it's the CBD and a tourist area. Best hawker centre is Tiong Bahru during the weekend especially or at lunch - weekday less than half of them are open during the evening."
,,Best Food Centre In Singapore,5.0,,"By far the best (and cleanest) food market in Singapore in our opinion. Full range of all the ethnic foods that are on offer in Singapore, very cheaply priced and extremely popular with all the local business people, especially at lunch time. Let your mind go wild and try something new and exotic, it can be found here."
,,Wide Selection of Food,5.0,,"There is definitely quite a varied selection of food stalls available to choose from. I went there for lunch at 11:30 am ahead of the busy time from noon to 2 pm. I didn’t have any problems finding a table to sit at after buying my food. I had a bowl of fish balls noodle soup which was very tasty and cost only S$3.50.

If it is busy, it’s best to “reserve” a seat first by placing a package of napkins on a table with a spare seat before going to order your food. There is no air-conditioning inside the building."
,,Amazing Food Stall,4.0,,first time in Singapore and this place has left me wanting more ... there are so many cuisines to choose from ... the atmosphere is amazing ...
,,"Cheap, handy",4.0,,you can eat here different kind of asian cuisine- from cheap to a little more valued. it can get crowded
,,Interesting place in the middle of the financial district,4.0,,"What a great variety of food. Chilly crab, a bit pricy but do very nice. Don't go there too late though especially during a week day n some stalls were closed by 9.00pm"
,,Like a local,4.0,,"It`s not a fashionable restaurant, just a place to eat outstanding local food. The historical building adds something special to the tasty and cheap foodd. Plenty of choices! If you are able avoid time between 12 and 2 pm because it`s crowded then."
,,great place for satay,4.0,,"We visited this place for the satay with our two teenages, arrived at 5.30, satay stands which were outside the main bldg didnt start untill around 7.0pm, there is also an aray of food stools inside. Sat back and had a few beers waiting on the satays, there is fierce competition between the vendores, real fun, great cheap, tasty street food."
,,late dinner dine,2.0,,"Closing the street around 10 pm and serving a lot of grilled foods especially shrimps and squid makes me feel so excited. A lot of tourist eating and drinking. I just noticed that the other foods was so oily. Well, its a chinese style. The shrimps is so salty, i cant eat it."
,,Visited for lunch on a Friday always busy and always nice food,5.0,,"Nice food good prices, freshly cooked and always packed with people enjoying the food, the butter chicken was awesome,"
,,Open air BBQ / satay and cold Tiger beer,4.0,,"At 19:00, everyday, Boon Tat street is closed and tables and chairs are set in the middle of the road. From there you can order a variety of satay (skewered beef, mutton, chicken, prawns), from different vendors.
Personally I recommend the ones from stalls 7 and 8, as they got the best ones and it comes very quickly.
Also some of the vendors from the food court will offer their menus - try the Baby Kailan with sauce (vegetable), or the stingray. Those are simply delicious.

All in all a nice atmosphere, a bit touristy, but is a mandatory experience if you're visiting Singapore, and also a nice after-work option for those of us who work around the area."
,,Street Food,4.0,,"We took the MRT into the business district to find the big hawker centre situated in a Historical building. We started from the inside out - because of the many food stalls to choose from, we shared all the meals, leaving room to sample all the yummy different food stalls, the only disappointment was the freshly squeezed fruit juice stall - the man and woman manning the stall were most unfriendly (perhaps just too busy??). We ended our evening sitting at a table; on a street that is usually buzzing with cars during the day, we had good satay and people watched."
,,Great food,4.0,,Had a really enjoyable evening here eating scrumptious food. Just be prepared to make up your own mind about what you want to eat and sit or you will be harassed into having a meal a stall holder thinks you might like. Satay was delicious and the atmosphere is buzzing all evening.
,,Worth the food visit!,5.0,,"One of the biggest hawker centres we've been to in Singapore!

3 circles with 5-6 pathways that lead to the middle and food ALL around you!

The satay store that won the prize (a row outside of the circular tavern) had amazing satays of chicken and beef (the two we tried). We tried one shop's chicken rice (so-so), fried stingray (done quite well), Indonesian roast meat (reasonable) and the Asian bread ""bao"" which was lovely!

Absolutely mouthwatering and relatively inexpensive (but don't fancy the competing shopkeepers pitted against so many other stores!)"
,,Its okay,3.0,,"Very big and impressive venue especially with the quaint history tied to this place. Food wise, there is many varieties. Personally if you are coming from a neighboring country, then there food wont really wow you, but take this opportunity to try something different. Like we tried a food stall which sold Puerto Rican food and it was awesome! Great price and big portions!!"
,,Another awesome hawker centre,5.0,,"Another great Singapore Hawker Centre. A bit more modern and less congested than Maxwell Road Hawker Centre but both are well worth visiting. Food here is slightly more expensive than Maxwell Road but still very cheap!
There is large variety of cuisines here from all around Asia."
,,Where the locals eat,5.0,,"Lunch is good, a business card on a vacant table means someone is sitting there and will be back with food.
Dinner is better with the Satay Shacks opening to serve delicate sticks of Satay cooked the traditional way. You will get hassled to a table, but don't let them talk you into taking too much food. Try bits form all the stands.
Grab a beer and enjoy
Will probably eat here every night next time!"
,,A quiet little market now with a historical skeleton.,3.0,,"The Old Market is now a food centre for the office workers in the vicinity. 150 metres from the MRT subway train stations, this is a place to go after office hours for satay, a local grilled meat on a stick dish served with peanut chilli sauce and rice cakes with onions and cucumbers on the side. This place is rather quiet compared to the 1990s. But for a tourist. Grab some of the BBQ stuff and soup dishes, wash it down with coffee and tea just like the locals. Wow, minus the old smells and yukky things of the old days. Clean and bright, airy place to eat at."
,,Awesome satay!!!,4.0,,It's my fav food place in Singapore!! I love to eat satay on the street! And the prawn is SUPER yummy!!! You really need to try out here!
,,Best Satay #7 and 8,5.0,,"There is a whole long row of the road that is closed off for Satay at nights at Lau Pa Sat (Which means Old Market in Chinese) and I am here to review one of the store #7 and 8 which is already featured in many places, blogs, and I think even in Tripadvisor here!

I had tried a few of the stores in fact in the past and I find that the best was still the Best Satay #7 and 8. Their satay is always hot made and fresh. You will get your satay on your place hot and steamy with the extras. It's not that this is the BEST satay in Singapore though, but that's another story, for Lau Pa Sat... This is the best store definitely.

I came in pretty late and past midnight in far on Saturday and I was really hungry, but this place made my day.. I mean night. The food was nice and in fact when I was there, they made a slight accident and some of the satay caught fire... So they recooked everything in fact, throwing away the charred ones. I am still impressed.

Price wise, this is kind of more costly then most places because this is a tourist trap after all. Expect to pay for packages in $25 and above. Compared to places like Chomp Chomp where $5 or $10 is still possible, this place is not. Be prepared to pay if you want to come. And for drinks, its is also costly, but the trick is you can actually order it from other drink stores inside Lau Pa Sat.

Best Satay, you must at least try it once!"
,,Good Hawker Center,4.0,,Visit this one if you are in Singapore to try out the local fusion way of cooking. This is one of the places foreigners usually go to. Food is great.
,,Relaxing and great satay,4.0,,"Open air tables and seats with satay BBQ aside, smokes and beers are just wonderful for the night. Satays are very delicious. If less guys promoting their menus will be even better and relaxing."
,,Fabulous food in historic setting,5.0,,"Lau Pa Sat is a must visit hawkers centre easily accessible from Raffles place MRT. Fancy pig organ soup? They have it! Vegetarian Thai? The ubiquitous chillicrab? Amazing satay? Ice kachang? All here and at very low prices. The most amazing roast pork noodles cost me $4. Wander the inside and pick whatever you like. Don't forget the satay vendors on the street from 7 pm.

Huge fans keep the temperature hospitable and loads of sturdy seating is available."
,,Good local food,5.0,,"This market is in the financial center so you see many business people eating. Go to the stalls with the longer lines, they have the best food. Went here for breakfast and had a toasted egg and ham sandwich with coffee for $2.50. The Costa Rican stall has good burritos for a good price."
,,Huge selection of food,4.0,,For good authentic food from most parts of the globe this place has it all. Grab a table asap because it does get very busy. For a good feed and large selection for cheap this is the place to be.
,,a must visit,5.0,,Love Lau Pa Sat - I like to eat here every time I am in town. Highly recommended to everyone to try at least once. You will be hooked
,,best place for a street/ late night eat out,5.0,,"amazing location, great variety of different cuisines, satay on the streets is a must try. prices are affordable"
,,Old made new. Thanks for restoring and reliving again,5.0,,Local delights and Satay was great. Go with a group of friends so that you can share good food found all round in this upgraded food court. BYOW for best results.
,,Delicious Cheap Eats. Yum Yum Yum,5.0,,"Food inside the pavilion is great. Tasty, cheap and what a selection
You name it....They have it.
However.....it's not the pavilion most people go for. It's the wonderful satay.
As you walk around the pavilion you will be drawn to the far end by the small of bbq meats and incredible sauces.
In the courtyard outside a selection of chefs are busily preparing fresh Satay on their own bbq and believe me....It's some of the best food you'll eat in Singapore.
And $35 for 50 satay skewers makes all the more sweet.
A must in Singapore."
,,Spoilt for choice,4.0,,"We had a couple of brunches and an evening meal here. Travelled as 2 couples so the hawker stalls work well to cater for all tastes .... Indian, Turkish, pizza, bakeries , Chinese, Filipino, Korean , Japanese, Singaporean etc etc etc
Allow about $5 a dish
Satay sticks 70c each in bundles of 10,20,30 etc. and great choice of beverages."
,,Convenient,4.0,,"Having Lau Basar right in the middle of CBD is very convenient, especially at nights, for restaurants and shops are usually closed at 8-9 p.m. Besides, it offered a wide range of food selections, from local snacks to dim sum, pastry and ice. Only that the price is a bit high here."
,,Spoilt For Choice,5.0,,"What a great place to take your pick of authentic cuisine from all over SE Asia and beyond! The choice is bewildering and the 3 times I ate there the food was superb. It is always busy but particularly at breakfast, lunch and dinner times."
,,A great place to eat a tasty snack.,4.0,,This famous old former colonial market place now houses a wide selection stalls serving delicious food. Those interested in architecture will also be interested in the original cast iron filligri work roof supports and pillars. Located approx 100m from Raffles Place. An hour should be sufficient time for a meal/drink.
,,Dissapointing,3.0,,"Having been told many stories about the hawker markets I was disappointed with this one. It has been rebuilt and I fear made far more characterless than it probably used to be. The food looked good and there is a amazing choice at very fair prices but it felt like the "" sanitised version"" the building is lovely with a very high iron and glass roof and worth a look in its own right. However there may be other, more original Hawker experiences to be had."
,,Best place to check out local food.,4.0,,"""Lau Pa Sat"" means ""Old Market""in translation. It serves a wide variety of local food. Go with an empty stomach and fill it with all the goodies."
,,Not a tourist attraction - it's a food court,3.0,,"My friend and I recently dined here and had a variety of satay sticks. It's an open food court and they close the neighbouring street off at night for the food court to eat outside, however it's a food court and not a tourist attraction."
,,Melting pot..,4.0,,"Amount of food here is awesome, take time to walk around and see before buying, similar food can have varying prices, and food on display like bbq pork and duck may be served cold ask for hot.
Satays are every where great experience. Must visit if you go to SG"
,,All that food!,4.0,,"I was visiting my sister and brother in law and they insisted that we visited Lau Pa Sat and I was not disappointed. The amount of food stalls available was incredible and I had to have several walkarounds before I could decide what I was going for first (which was crispy won ton noodles).

After 3 courses and being fit to burst, we headed outside to where the satay stalls are and we went to Satay Best 7 and 8 where I had the best prawn satays I have ever had in my whole life.

Just such a shame I never got to go back for a second time during my 10 days in Singapore!"
,,You will regret if you don't go,5.0,,"My family and I tried Satay Best 7 and 8. The satay was UNDOUBTEDLY great! It's absolutely delicious and you will want to encore! The prawn was amazing that you can't find a single word to describe its good taste, as well as the beef and pork. Although there were lots of people and quite noisy, the atmosphere was warm and you won't want to leave. You must go there!"
,,Don't waste your time,1.0,,"I cant believe this place features in the top 100 list. How?! The place is hot and humid. Yes it might be where the locals come to eat but it stops there. Perhaps if its near and you really want some chicken satay then ok yes, but there are little other options. It just happened to be next to our hotel (sofitel) that we bothered to venture to it."
,,A downtown institution,4.0,,"Lau Pa Sat ('old bazaar') is an iconic building in downtown Singapore, now used as a food centre. Its atmosphere is very different between lunch and dinner time. At lunch, it is full of local office workers (very few ang mo as it's not air-conditioned and not posh enough!), since it is arguably the best and most comprehensive hawker centre in the CBD. In the evening, it is less packed (so you can appreciate the architecture more), and populated more with tourists. None of the eateries here made it into KF Seetoh's Makansutra guide to the best hawker stalls in Singapore, but quality at the better stalls is still pretty good. More importantly, it is amazingly diverse: chicken rice, carrot cake/oyster omelette, biryani, satay, Malay, bak kut teh, offals/kway chap, prawn mee, yong tau fu, etc. Since a recent innovation, there are also some foreign food stalls - Costa Rican, Turkish, Vietnamese, Korean & Japanese, Filipino; unfortunately, most of them are below or well below par."
,,Below average hawker centre,2.0,,"Food are in general below average. Other than satay which are good. After extensive renovation, ambience is better, but food is still bad."
,,Good quality food,4.0,,Went there for dinner in August 2015. Can easily be accessible. A large choice of food and drinks. I tried prawn noodles and a sugar can juice (for less than 10 SGD) and it was very good. Some people do not speak English well so not always easy to communicate. I recommend it.
,,Great Hawker Food,4.0,,A huge selection of delicious hawker food. There is certainly something for everyone here. I did some napkin math while eating the last time I was there and you could eat dinner at this place every night for more than a year without ever eating the same thing. Try it at least once while in SG and have fun stuffing your face!
,,Mixed reviews!,3.0,,"This pavilion contains several hawker stalls and various eating options. we each tried something different. Of the 5 of us, 2 really enjoyed their lunch while the other 3 were quite disappointed. I guess you have to choose the right thing! One thing we did note was that some of the stall owners spoke little English, (which was unusual for Singapore) and made it quite difficult for us to understand what was in some of the dishes."
,,Great hawker food,4.0,,"Don't think it is as good as it used to be , some of the stalls have been converted into shops , but still enough choice of some great street food . Just a short walk from Raffles Place and easy walk from Marina Bay"
,,Lau Pa Sat = Satay Heaven,5.0,,"Searched for satay following a long flight from Paris. Went to Chinatown first but there was only one stall on Smith St with an hour wait according to the stall vendor.
After getting advice from our hotel bagman I visited Lau Pa Sat.
Straight away you can notice the great atmosphere and abundance of satay stalls. Tourists and locals alike dine together on outdoor tables with orders taken at your seat. Paid around 70c per satay, with the usual cucumber and onion condiments and beautiful satay sauce.
Well worth a visit for the satay and the local experience."
,,Great place for a bite to eat like the locals,4.0,,"An institution in Singapore this is hawker food to the max. Great place to drop in for lunch or dinner as you can choose from a myriad of different places to eat. Beware it gets very busy indeed to finding a place to sit can be a challenge.

Food is generally good and very cheap so if you're on a budget this is great value, especially for Singapore."
,,Must visit in the evenings,3.0,,"An historical venue that dates back to the colonial days. Lunch time is crowded with those from the nearby offices. Best avoided. In the evenings, a side road is closed for the setting up of open air food stalls, serving nice BBQ skewers called Satay. Dipped in spicy & sweet peanut sauce, plus open air breeze. A welcomed break in this busy city"
,,Bustling food,4.0,,"So much going on, lots of choice, free toilets, reasonable prices. We went to a patisserie for a slice of apple pie with cream and fruit for 4 dollars, a great finish after grabbing some skewers outside"
,,Try a Satay Stick at Lau Pa Sat,4.0,,"Every evening at 7pm the street between Lau Pa Sat and the Sofitel So Hotel is closed off and made into a mall so the Satay stalls and tables and chairs can be set up. The delicious smell of Satay wafts down the street as people settle in at their tables with a beer to start people watching. You can also choose to eat from the Pavilion and bring your food outside (or eat inside) where you will find a variety of foods from Singaporian, Indian, Chinese, vegetarian, noodles, noodle soups, rice, fresh juices, desserts, etc. It's very hustle and bustle and if you forget your tissues or wet wipes, don't worry as there are hawkers walking around from table to table selling them. It's a great look into a traditional food hawkers market and a must visit if you are in the vicinity."
,,"Interesting experience, average food",3.0,,"We visited Lau Pa Set for a taste of local Singaporean hawker style food and to sample the satays. The atmosphere and hustle was what you would expect from a busy hawkers market and getting a table is not always easy. The sights and smells certainly heighten the experience, but it's a pretty sweaty experience too!
We found the food disappointing, both from the couple of stalls inside we tried and also the satays we bought from the street vendors outside.
Whist it was an authentic hawker style experience the food was probably the most disappointing we had whilst in Singapore. We found Satay by the Bay to be a far better food experience."
,,Satay Sticks in Singapore!,5.0,,For the past two years we have looked for the Satay Club in Singapore as it used to be in Clarke Quay and finally this year we discovered the wonderful Lau Pa Sat Festival Pavilion! During the day you can get all sorts of Asian food but at night the close off the street and out comes the Satay Club! They fill the street with tables and chairs and within no time it's filled with people enjoying the wonderful Satay Sticks at an incredibly cheap price! I whole heartedly recommend this place if you want to taste the delights of the Satay Club!!!
,,"Hustle, bustle and great food",4.0,,"We were drawn to the hawkers market by the smell of charcoal and satays. Outside seating certainly has the most character, especially if you like people watching. The satays are copious and delicious, the noodles are gorgeous, and the variety is superb. Great fun."
,,"Really cheap, really good food!",5.0,,"Had a few small bites from a couple of different stands here, and they were exceptional!

The satay is amazing! You haven't had satay until you've had satay in Singapore! Must visit for lunch or dinner during your stay in Singapore.

Tip: bring tissues to wipe your fingers!"
,,Quality local food at reasonable prices,4.0,,"As a local who's quite proud of our local food, the food here is definitely not the best, but of good quality. It's for anyone wanting to try classic Singapore dishes in a relatively clean and well furbished place, without travelling far to some hawker centre outside the city centre, which most locals would honestly not even know about now that times are changing."
,,Overated,1.0,,Very very touristy. Stalls are just of the same food with PRC cooks who clearly lack expertise. Head elsewhere.
,,Hawker food at its best in Singapore,5.0,,"Grab a seat at the many tables and in seconds a tiger beer waiter will be on hand to deliver some needed cooling refreshment

Sit back & breath in the exotic smells and sounds of asian cooking - then wander around and choose what you fancy and bring it back to the table.

The satay are yummy, the Char Kway Teo (noodles) worth travelling for and then take your taste buds on an adventure across Asia

It is hot and humid (hey it is singapore) so shorts & T shirts are required

No issue getting a taxi later - defiantly worth a visit with everything to cater for all tastes"
,,Fascinating place to wonder around and sample local cuisine,3.0,,Lau Pa Sat or also known as Telok Aiyer Market is in the Central Business District and is known more for its atmosphere than the food. The place comes alive after sunset with mostly tourists looking to sample local cuisines. The stall indoor are reasonably priced but outdoor Satay stalls are expensive for what they offer. You will also be constantly haggled by vendors wanting to sell you stuff as you sit down to eat. Singapore is full of many such eating pavilions with better and cheaper food albeit without the same atmosphere.
,,"Already becomes a tourist hell, forget it.",1.0,,"Now have more ""specialist"" like high value seafood, S$3 full ice juicy, TaiFood, Japanese etc. No more a hawker market. We are intended to find Satay food the day we go. However, maybe it is Sunday, no Satay hawker found, a man comes across and said he can get satay, a usual 40 pieces cost S$49 already. More worst, wait for 15 minutes and when it comes, it is not hot just warm. We feel suck."
,,Back again Since I'm back in Singapore,5.0,,"Great food excellent prices, A must visit when in Singapore, meals range from $5 upwards, a Jug of beer is 17 - 19 which you will get 4 pints out of. The street adjacent is closed at 7pm for the satay stalls."
,,Good Varieties of Food!,3.0,,"A lot of varieties food. It is a best place for tourist to hunt for Singapore food. Too many choices around, and it definitely a distraction to go for the best one. Be aware of the crowd during the lunch hour as there are a lot of office towers nearby. The price range is very reasonable. It was a good complimentary i could say as I stayed at Sofitel So Singapore Hotel, just next to it. Easy for me to hunt for food at any time."
,,Historical!,5.0,,"Great variety of foods (try all the Singaporean, Cuban, Indian, Japanese places if you can) in this historical building lost in the middle of all the CBD's skyscrapers. Enjoy at any time of the day!"
,,Historic Venue that houses a food court,3.0,,"This is a landmark of Singapore, which has Victorian style metal structures which is pretty.

Itbhouse a hawker centre in its earlier years before underling extensive renovations and refurbishments to restore it to its former glory.

It now houses a big food court, with a wide variety of cuisine. An average meal here will cost about $6.

At night, the street next to it is closed and concerted into a satay paradise. Satay is BBQ skewered meat and eaten with peanut sauce. Eating here along the street is unique and a good experience."
,,Big variety for the small pocket,4.0,,"A renovated fish market now an indoor/outdoor food pavilion. You can visit a variety of stall and choose from all varieties of Asian delicacies. Beer is available and there is waiter service on the outside seating areas so you can order satay and noodles from one place, beer from another and a sweet from yet another and all will be brought to your table - you will need to settle each bill separately.
Extremely reasonable prices and the satay cooked in front of us was delicious!"
,,Get your satay fix here,4.0,,"I was a little hesitant to eat 'street food' but when we got to Lau Pa Sat totally changed my mind. Each vendor's shop front looked clean, the food looked good and really there was just so much to choose from. We were really searching for the satay sticks which are actually outside the pavillion on the street and you must must must try the satay sticks, I think we ate at no.6 but I'm sure they are all really similar. Overall this place is really clean and a great experience, if you forget to bring tissues (they dont have serviettes) they have people selling them and I don't know if they have toilets as I didnt have to go while I was there."
,,Delicious - and affordable - local food,5.0,,"Fantastic variety of cuisine and a lively vibe. Heaps to choose from, and all at very affordable prices (unlike many tourist-focused eating spots). Best pork bao available here."
,,Satay Satay,4.0,,"One of the first hawker centre in Singapore, beautiful iron architecture recently refurbished. Great variety of different food but the most interesting part, is Satay Street. Lots of tourists, excellent satays, great ambience. Make sure to buy tissues from the old guy that passes around (they will be useful) but mostly because he will keep coming back until you buy some. Easy to access by MRT."
,,Food paradise,4.0,,It's a food paradise! You may find international cuisine in this little place. But some of the restaurants selling the same food with quite difference price. Better walk around before order.
,,Amazing and unmissable,5.0,,"Great Hawkers centre with lots of choice, good quality and amazing prices. Be ready with some hand wipes as it can get messy if you pick food from the stalls off ""satay street"". We had delicious and good quality dumplings in the centre and prawn and chicken satay from stalls 7-8 on satay st - their satay sauce was the best we'd ever tasted and the prawns were huge. Get a seat in the centre, grab a jug of beer and get stuck in with all there is to try. Unmissable experience in Singapore and within walking distance (about 10 mins) of the waterfront to catch the light show from MBS."
,,Spoilt for choice,5.0,,"Great Hawkers market with so much choice!!
Don't go looking for fine dining or comfy seats but food so fresh & well cooked you can't go wrong and with prices you wish you could bring back to the UK.
I had the fried Tilapia fish with rice whilst my husband chose from one of the other stalls doing amazing dishes of chicken."
,,Too good to miss,5.0,,"This food centre is really worth a visit. There are lots different foods to choose from and the prices are reasonable too. The good thing about this place is the fact that it has a roof so if it rains you don't get wet. Also at night they close off the street and the stalls are out there too.

I can't recommend this market highly enough, it is great. Try Mamacitas Costa Rican Food Stall, it is really good value and the food is fantastic!!"
,,Authentic feel to it,4.0,,A very brief pit stop here as we were on our way to meet up with friends and were lost! It seemed an authentic experience to us and we can imagine it gets very busy when the tours arrive. But would like to return to sample the food next time.
,,Food paradise and unique location,5.0,,"Not only this place has got some of the finest samples of local, asian and world cuisine in a form of the street market. at night this place transforms into an open market with tables placed on the closed road: the view from those tables is surreal: glass and concrete skyscrapers next to almost 'primitive' food stalls.

A bit of advice. As soon as you are coming in you'll be pestered by Satay sellers. If you don't want satay, just politely decline their advances, and go straight to the stalls where all sorts of food is being sold, buy your food and occupy any table (inside or outside). If you are after Satay, then you need to use services of those 'salesmen' - they all seem to serve the same sort of food for the same price, so just go with whoever you like."
,,A feast for your eyes and one for lovers of satay,5.0,,"This hawkers centre was opposite our hotel we were staying at so we tended to opt for here rather than pay hotel prices for food. The variety and diversity of food was amazing and the setting was unbelievably clean. It is quite wonderful at night as they close off the road and set-up tables so you can eat under the stars surrounded by the urban metropolis that is Singapore. On the road of an evening there are a number of sellers set-up selling satays - they are delicious.

Plenty of the local delicacies are offered through the stalls there including chicken rice, kway teow, rojak, chilli crab and at prices that blow away what you would pay at a restaurant at Clarke Quay."
,,Its all about the Satay,5.0,,"I was introduced to Satay when first serving in Malaya with the RAE in 1967. My enthusiasm has not lagged at all and when in the vicinity of Indonesia, Singapore or Malaysia I am always on the hunt for good Satay. For many years now when passing through Singapore I always head for Lau Pa Pat Festival Pavilion and go to the street of Satay stalls beside it. It is easily accessed by the MRT from all over Singapore and the street is just full of simple tables and chairs with the Satay stalls down one side. At night it becomes a lot of fun and is frantic as Satay stalls compete for your business. Plenty of Drinks available as the ladies circulate taking orders for mainly beer but the Pavilion beside as well as serving all types of oriental food has a wide variety of drinks on sale.
Of course there is the Satay as well. Simple .. Usually for or five varieties to choose from and it is quick and affordable.
And when the old guys come to your table selling tissues for $1, buy some as it can get a bit messy and you may need them."
,,Great Food,5.0,,"This is the first hawker food center in Singapore. It was built in 1894 and it looks very Victorian…absolutely beautiful. Location of it is strange because it is kind of stuck in the middle of business district.
Great variety of food, we had black pepper crab and stingray (very spicy). It looks very pretty at night."
,,"Eat, Eat and Eat",4.0,,"Located in the heart of Singapore. Lau Pat Sat is a food haven, you can chose all types of food. Prices are crazy cheap and food is great quality. Love that tourists and locals use this place. Can't wait to my next trip for satay, curry and much more"
,,"Good food, great atmos, poor service",4.0,,"Our hotel receptionist recommended this place, where they close off the street at night and it turns into Satay Street. We had barbecued chicken, lamb and shrimp satay with fried rice and bok choi and onion greens. To be fair, the barbecued dishes were very good, the shrimp (langoustines?) were enormous and probably the best I've ever had. Sadly you choose the bbq and your veg dishes from different vendors and they arrived 20 minutes apart, which took the enjoyment right out of the meal."
,,Great hawker market,5.0,,"Wonderful experience.the food was great,lots of choices.the best cheap eats in singapore,a must visit."
,,Not bad but over priced,3.0,,"Although the food was pretty good it wasn't worth the price. This is a hawker area geared toward tourist. My advise is to ask a taxi driver or hotel receptionist which hawker stand they prefer. There are over 40,000 stands in Singapore and they all get inspected and their grades for cleanliness is displayed in the front of thier stall. We found a place near the Queensway shopping center and it was fantastic and I'd recommend it."
,,Must do in Singapore,3.0,,"Without trying hawker food, you couldn't really claim you have experienced Singapore. This is a very known and famous for hawker food. Vast selection of choices from Malaysian to Thai and from European and Indian. All sorts Buzzing night and day"
,,Beautiful builidng with a variety of food stalls.,4.0,,"On our previous trips to Singapore, we failed to go to Lau Pa Sat and we would not be denied this time. Planned to go for dinner to experience the stalls offering satay on the street but had to visit for lunch instead due to time constraint.
My daughter, who is a conservation architect, loved the structure with its beautiful ceiling. The place isn't so bad with its huge ceiling fans and open sides which kept the place well-ventilated.
During lunch, not all the stalls were open. We settled for our favorite SIngapore fare - Grilled sting ray, crispy baby squid, and fishball noodle soup. All were freshly prepared, very flavorful and serving size was adequate. Food was also very affordable. Our lunch for 4 people cost less than S$50 with drinks.
I've read that the satay stalls which open at night serve very delicious assorted satay. This would have to wait till our next Singapore visit."
,,A bit of the past and the flavors of Singapore,4.0,,"This historic outdoor dining area with its beautiful architecture is the perfect place to sit and eat. Wait until 7 pm for dinner and sit next to the Satay vendors. At 7 pm they close the street and lay down the tables for their customers. Of course order the amazing Satays with a side of peanut sauce and pressed rice, chili crabs and a variety of asian and latin cuisine. Personally, I favor the local food but local is now debatable as Singapore has become a melting pot of various cultures from all over. Beware of the smoke from the Satay vendors though as the wind can blow them towards your table."
,,Excellent selection of quality food,5.0,,"Lau Pa Sat became our favorite hawker center during our holiday. All the Singaporean must-eats are available, as well as a wide variety of other items. The seafood, like both black pepper and chili crab as well as stingray, were totally delicious servings that we'll miss the most. The specialties of the 'house' are the various satay skewers and they are definitely worth a try. Compared the other hawker centers, Lau Pa Sat is as its best in the evenings between six and 10 pm. As usual, drinks are bought from a specialized vendor and usually there are waitresses mingling about to offer you a refill. Good value for your S$:s."
,,Beware of grumpy vendors...,2.0,,"This was a must do for us. It was recommended by so many people… We arrived early at about 5:00pm. Not all the stalls were open so quickly did a survey and found one thing we wanted to try- satay! Unfortunately only one stall was opened at the time and it only served a Chinese version of what satay is supposed to be (AUD$15 for 20x baby sized skewers). By the time we finished, the
Malay stall was opened- the real satay with peanut sauce. I guess you shouldn’t go too early or too late ☹
Biggest shock was how rude the vendors are. I’m assuming they are not locals as they couldn’t speak English. No one knew what “Sweet and Sour Pork” was ?? Beware of the woman at the drink stall. She throws your change at you and turns away in a dismissive manner… WT…?"
,,From Sate to Sushi,4.0,,"A great experience and cheap, good food of all varieties - laksa, sushi, satay and everything in between.

Inside the ornate ironwork building are stalls with tables at which to eat the food that takes your fancy, both sweet and savoury. There are also juices and beer available. A small grocery shop around the outside sells individual bottles of wine, if you prefer a nice cold Chardonnay. Take your own napkins or wet wipes because none are provided, although there are some on sale from vendors who come around the tables.

Outside is where the charcoal burners and BBQs are sizzling with hundreds of sticks of satay. Sitting on a trestle table, surrounded by the skyscrapers of the CBD, nibbling on smoky satay and sticky, sweet peanut sauce is an experience not to miss. Then go for cocktails. It's a top night out!"
,,"Come for the Heritage, but the food can be better elsewhere",4.0,,"Lau Pa Sat, which in in a mix of Hokkien dialect in local Malay language means Old Market, is a popular heritage site. The architecture makes this a Singapore landmark and one of the places to visit for local street food.

In my younger days, I hear my friends mention that they have the best Satay in Singapore (although i would say in reality it’s a hit and miss). Nevertheless, the place is a good place to sample a variety of asian street food from Chinese, Peranakan, Malay and other South East Asian delicacies.

Heritage building lovers will love the architecture and the clock tower that sits on top of it. The area of course is in the heart of the financial district and very close to Marina Bay Sands."
,,Beautiful Heritage Building,4.0,,"Worth a visit to see this lovely heritage iron building which has been refurbished recently.
Once housing Hawker stalls it now has trendy slightly up market shops that sell food etc.
Mostly tourist eat here with perhaps the odd office worker .
I found that the use was OK not bastardized like so many other historic places .
would recommend a look and perhaps a cuppa coffee , all the tea was Early Grey or camomile ."
,,Great Hawkers Market,4.0,,"Went here for dinner with friends on 2 occasions whilst staying in Singapore and having it recommended to us. Great choice, great food and the beer is cheap (relative to the rest of Singapore ) and if you go in the evening don't forget to look outside where you will find all the satay being cooked. Take the time to walk around before placing you orders as you will defiantly find something to your taste. Fantastic."
,,Highly recommended because of the architecture and food!,3.0,,"Also known as Telok Ayer, this market deserves a visit not only for the food but also because of the architecture.
This is one of Singapore landmarks, built on an octagonal industrial cast-iron style.
There is a mix of Chinese, Indian, Peranakan, Vietnamese, Costa Rican (!) and other western food (patisserie also available).
We tried one of the stalls with traditional Singaporean staples, since we were looking for carrot cake, oyster omelette and chendol.
We found it tasty, though a bit oily.

We recommend this place for a quick sneak-pick of the Singaporean food centres."
,,Too pricey,3.0,,"It's a great venue but we got 30 sticks of satay costing us $42, also had a problem getting change. Next day we had satay at chinatown satay stalls costing $21, you do the maths, maybe other food is cheaper but I wouldnt call it an authentic experience. satay stalls at Garden by the bay are good too."
,,"Oh, What to eat?????",4.0,,"In the heart of the financial district, Lau Pa Sat is a must visit when the businesses close and the street gets taken over by sellers of street food. There are hundreds of stalls and the choice is mind blowing.

Be warned, you will have your fill and then feel tempted to try something else"
,,Singapore's Night Food Market,5.0,,"Lau Pa Sat is a pavilion or food court at Raffles. When we went there not all stores are open (read somewhere that it was renovated and rents increased so some stalls didn't return). There were stalls which sell indian food, chinese food, malay/SG food, seafood like chili crab (kinda expensive), refreshments stall. But you should really go here to try & taste their award winning satay! Order from stalls outside. It's a nice place to chill after a long day over delicious satay, rice, kway teow & beer. :) Closes at 12mn."
,,Lovely Eating Place in the heart of the financial district,4.0,,"An century old architect in mist of modern buildings @ singapore business district !
Its place where you get “Variety” of food ranging from vegetarian to non vegetarian .. (Ambience is good)

Best time to visit is in the evening when side street is turned into hawker food street - offering the best of local cuisine (Off-course cold beer ) and enjoy a plate “satay” (is a dish of seasoned, skewered and grilled meat, which is served with a sauce @ peanut)

PS: avoiding going at office lunch time hour - getting place to sit is bit diffcult"
,,A must come here,4.0,,"I and my family after we walked for 2 hours, and our family was feeling hungry try the local food and china.Places very nice to try and playing all kinds of food.Star from local food to international food. We here just want to try and some food very good."
,,Lau Pa yummy food worth a visit,5.0,,"during a work trip to Singapore we were introduced to this place by a work colleague. Over a 10 day work trip I visited this place about 8 times sometimes twice a day for lunch and the evening meal, prices range fro $4.50 for an indian meal, to $40 for pepper crab, or 70cents each for a chicken satay. and $18 for BBQ Chilli Stingray, the food is great and cheap. I noticed all stores had a rating of B for food safety and hygiene which is good 'A' being the best to 'D' the worst.
This was a 15 minute walk from our hotel and a 20 minute waddle back after a great meal and a couple of beers. a jug of Tiger was $19.

Well worth a visit or or 2 or three times.I'll be re visiting the next time I get to Singapore, fingers crossed it will not be a 10 year gap like last time."
,,Amazing place to try different foods,5.0,,"I run into this place whole I was looking for a dim sun restaurant. I just couldn't believe my eyes. There are all sorts of restaurants with cuisine from all different places in Asia, and it is very tasty and relatively cheap for Singapore. I tried Indian, dim sun and Korean on different occasions. Fruit juices were also quite amazing."
,,A lot of food,5.0,,"We just walked here from Merlion Park, and we found endless choice of foods with good prices. Perfect opportunity to try the foods here since we already hungry from the walk. Just try to eat as much as you can."
,,A Variety of Food can be found here,4.0,,"Lau Pa Sat, at here u cn find almost every kind of food tat u cn think of...but the price is a bit pricey The lacking number of fan making the place hot"
,,Choose wisely,3.0,,"I've been to Lau Pa Sat twice, first time in 2007, second time in 2014, both times I'm not very satisfied with the satays, they're dry and tasteless. The seafood there was average as well. I had high hopes for the chilli crab, but it let me down. I'm sure there must be great food vendors there, but be sure to do the homework before the visit, because there's so many to choose from!"
,,Best place to try all Asian food,5.0,,"If you want to try out an eclectic Asian fusion here is the place. Every type of dish you could imagine from vendors selling in the revamped pavillion. Go in the evening and they close the adjacent street and you can eat al fresco. We had indian vegetarian, Filipino roast chicken, chinese noodles and more. It's cheap too so only you tummy will stop you eating more. Its a must for foodies"
,,Many Good Restaurant,4.0,,You can find many god food stall here with so many choice with affordable price. It is quite busy during lunch and dinner time
,,A different dining experience,5.0,,"What a delightful find! So many different types of food and stallholders, it is difficult to choose which one to buy from! Very good for vegetarians. We spent ages walking around the different stalls and eventually parted company to purchase our lunch separately and then met again at one of the many tables provided for sitting. Food was excellent and varied, plenty to eat and very cheap (6 SGD for rice, 3 different veggie curries and dhal). Yummy, would definitely revisit, especially to try another cuisine. Very clean."
,,Delicious Yum Cha,4.0,,"Arrived in the city around 2am after a long flight and was craving some good food so everyone I asked recommended Lau Pa Sat which was close to my accommodation. Ended up at the yum cha / dim sum stand and everything was so delicious. Prawn, crystal and pork dumplings, bbq pork buns and spring rolls. Very good quality, especially that early in the morning. The lady running the stall was a bit cranky but understandable at that time but we eventually got a smile out her! If I lived in Singapore having access to this place (sober or drunk) would be dangerous... so much better than a kebab!"
,,Great tight Arxx dinner,5.0,,Was a regular to old venue. Even better now. Took some colleagues who had never heard of it. They thought it was an amazing and authentic hawker experience. You must visit. Dinner and drinks $20!
,,Great food and sooooo much better value than the normal restaurants,4.0,,"Great choice, great food and the beer is cheap (relative to the rest of Singapore ) and if you go in the evening you can grab a table in 'Satay Street' just outside and experience waft of bbqs under a starry sky in the middle of downtown Singapore. Fantastic."
,,Great hawker food,4.0,,"Lau Pa Sat offers an endless selection of traditional Singaporean hawker food as well as Western dishes. Satay is also available from the satay vendors outside the pavilion. The quality of the food is excellent and the prices are very reasonable. The only downside is the condition of the rest rooms. I am not sure if they are always in such an appalling state, but the next time, I would definitely avoid using them."
,,"Nicely restored, good introduction to Hawker style",4.0,,"We visited this centre around 6pm on a Sunday night with 15 people and had no trouble finding seating. The centre is clean and has recently been restored and if you are considering visiting a Hawker centre but a little intimidated, this is a good place to go. The food selection is great and prices very reasonable. Make sure to head outside to find the Satay vendors although they will probably find you first! Also a good selection of western food like pizza for those with less adventurous tastebuds.."
,,Endless Choices,4.0,,Our group of 6 friends went for lunch & we couldn't believe the huge choices of authentic international food that is on offer for a really really cheap price. Seems the place to eat for locals which is always a good sign. Fabulous food and a meal costs around S$6. Don't miss it
,,Dozens of food hawkers in a beautifully renovated cast-iron pavilion.,5.0,,"Close to several MRT stops in the CBD near Marina Bay, Lau Pat is packed with office workers and travelers looking for good food and value. Bustling atmosphere and clean public restrooms."
,,Great meal in the heart of downtown,5.0,,"We headed here for a bite to eat on night. We ended up having satay on the street. It was delicious! Freshly bbq chicken, prawn and mutton satay with a spicy peanut sauce. Great spot to sit out beneath the sky scrapers and enjoy good food."
,,Great food in a fun venue,5.0,,"This food court is great for breakfast (yum cha), snacks (fresh fruit) and for dinner (satay in the street). We visited here several times during our stay at The Sail, Marina Bay."
,,Overpriced bad food,1.0,,"Really lovely building but he food was so so expensive and bad. The sugar cane drink was watered down - how mean is that? The grilled fish was tasteless. I have never had such appealing food in Singapore. If you want to see the lovely building, I suggest you have a teh tarik, look around and then leave...whatever you do, don't eat anything!"
,,STREET FOOD,4.0,,"Singapore Lau Pa Sat is situated right at the heart of Singapore’s Centre District and when in Singapore it is a place you must not miss. It was built in 1894 and is the largest remaining Victorian filigree cast-iron structure in Southeast Asia. It was formerly a wet market known as Telok Ayer market and is now restored to a hawker centre at CBD area offering a wide range of Singapore local food
During day time beside the Victorian building structure, the hawker is nothing different from others hawker centre. The food it served could be found in most of the hawker centre and food court around Singapore. It is packed with people from the neighboring offices around the hawker centre during night time the whole stretch of Boon Tat street south of the Lau Pa Sat is blocked out to give way for an open air hawker. The road is filled out with tables and chairs for people to eat BBQ food. It creates a unique ambiance and feeling when you eat your food outdoors. If you are in Singapore and want to try hawker street-food then I suggest a visit for lunch or dinner would be recommended."
,,Old market tuned into street foods haven,4.0,,"An unique memorable dining experience, cheap, and tasty. Try a few ! Clean and cool with big fans. Nostalgic. Near Merlion and Fullerton. Hainanese chicken rice is cheap and good. Fish noodle soup is average. Many food stalls, you just has to try it yourself."
,,Worth a visit if you can avoid the crowds,4.0,,"Good food, lovely building (didn’t see inside before the renovation but I understand it is much better) – I often look for the Handmande noodle stall and order the #1 dish with Ee Mian – this is the first time I have had fresh Ee mian (they usually have every noodle freshly made but Ee mian is dried ). Try and avoid the lunchtime crush – this place is bang in the middle of the business district after all…. I got stuck in a line that barely moved as a lot of people seemed to be ordering for 6 people to take away (back to the office?) … For someone who has no sense of direction it is quite a confusing place (huge and everywhere looks the same) and I got lost trying to find my table after I got my food! Next time I will not chop (save my place with a tissue) – just get my food first and find a seat! To summarise – get there before 12 and take a compass!"
,,Great food,5.0,,"Has been recently renovated, so is a little more upmarket that the local hawker markets. Excellent food. Must do Satay Street out the back of an evening....the hustle and bustle of the Tiger Beer girls, the touts for the stalls and the smell of the satay sticks cooking is so Singapore. We tried a couple of them but found Stall 7-8 called Best Satay the best."
,,After the latest renovation: a mixed bag.,3.0,,"This month marks the 40th anniversary of my first visit to Singapore, and of my first meal at Lau Pa Sat (then Telok Ayer Market, though mostly converted to a food hall by the time of that visit.) Also the 40th anniversary of my first visit to the original Satay Club, which was subsequently moved a couple (or more?) times, finally winding up here. I've come back occasionally since then. Recently visited for the first time since this recent renovation.

Went with a group of extended family for satay and other stuff. None of the others had revisited since the renovation. We went on a cool, clear Saturday about 9PM. The group sat outside – at the adjacent tables where satay, and other stuff, was being cooked. But a few of us also walked through the main hall – for washing hands, getting drinks and other extras, and to check out the place. Outside tables (rickety metal, with cheap plastic stools, set up on the roadway which is closed for this purpose during the evening) were mostly taken – but two adjacent tables were prominently vacant – just enough for our group. Hawkers came by to push their menu/price cards in our faces. Satay sellers were heavily pushing their “sets” which we found to be a bad deal on pricing and nil on flexibility. We ordered chicken and mutton satay, chili stingray, squid, chicken wings and drumsticks, morning glory, and a bit of steamed rice – and got the drinks separately. I had iced lemon tea – and later went back for sugar cane juice. Our satay had good (very fresh, well selected, cut and cooked to order) meat, apparently no marinating of the meat, poor-quality sauce (appeared to have been padded with cornstarch, seemed oilier with cheap added oil – and lacking of natural oil emanating directly from the peanuts, no chilli spiciness – in short, cheap quick preparation with minimal to no simmering), and so-so salad accompaniments (average cucumber, white rather than red onion where I much prefer red, and tofu). The stingray was good, the morning glory was delicious (fresh, with perfect chili level), the chicken wings and drumsticks were nice. My iced lemon tea was typical {a bit too sweet IMHO, as unfortunately is common} – my sugar cane juice tasted more like sugar-water than sugar cane extract {though they were squeezing the cane when not serving customers - but I suspect some later dilution from water or melting ice}. It made me wish for the good old days in Singapore (and the better places in Malaysia) when price and profit pressures had less impact on food quality than they do now.

My brother-in-law noted that he had recently visited East Coast Park for satay, on a Thursday. At first taste, the satay seemed a bit odd, and also dry and tough. On the second stick he realized that it had been coated with sugar. By his reckoning, the meat could have been a day or more old, and perhaps even recooked – with the sugar perhaps to mask parted of the “aging” of the meat – and the toughness perhaps resulting from the “twice-cooked” process. He said that he complained, and the hawker acted sheepishly in response. The meat here was far better than that, at least.

My impression of the renovation of the building? The exterior seems essentially the same as after its last reconstruction ~25 years ago. I didn't notice a difference to the inside of the main structure, either. (Good on both of those points.) The place seems a bit lighter and more airy (renovation reportedly reduced the number of stalls and increased the seating area and number of seating places). On this Saturday mid-evening the inside tables were about half occupied – leaving many places for diners. I'm not sure how well the floor will stand up to the wear and tear of heavy usage. I think that the wrong material was selected – which will have to be replaced within a year – or be left to look grungy.

The demographics were interesting. I didn't see any Caucasians outside, other than myself. I saw few non-Caucasians inside, other than vendors & workers of the place. This is not as it used to be pre-renovation (and might not be the same as weekdays at lunchtime). Was this a strange night, or has this become typical? My companions, all locals, offered the opinion that it is more expensive inside. I spied that on the price boards of the food stalls that I looked at – though drinks prices were what I would expect for this downtown place. Food prices do seem higher than prior to the renovation. This is not unusual, as such renovations often result in steep increases in rental rates – with prices similarly rising – to the disgust of, and sometimes the avoidance (at least for awhile) by, locals in the know.

A suggestion. As satay IMHO is a function of meat selection, freshness, and cook-to-order; plus quality of the sauce; plus selection and quality of the salad accompaniments; plus vibe of the location – walk around the area – sample the satay sauce, check the meat and accompaniments before ordering. If they push sets on you – make sure that they aren't padding the price, and aren't giving you stuff you don't want (e.g. expensive prawns to pad the price, when you may only want chicken, mutton, beef, or pork). If one vendor is hustling his wares less than the others - it might be worth asking - is this place doing better on quality, forcing the others to push their sales? Maybe that place is a potential winner? An hypothesis to test on the next visit.

Also, check the prices of the other hawkers who push their menu cards on you. Are they good quality and value, or aggressive hustle? We like Indian food – but found the vendor near to our table to be overpriced far beyond what we were prepared to pay. (Would I pay $10 here for murtabak which is $6 elsewhere? Probably not, unless we saw food reviews which justified the price.} We generally eat hawker food in the heartlands, where prices are 30-50% lower than here for; though the price here for satay was competitive (e.g. good). Just order a la carte and don't fall for the “set promotions” unless that is exactly what you want."
,,Tasty Lunchtime Madness,4.0,,"After enjoying the views from the Singapore Flyer, it was time for us to enjoy some hawker stand food. The first time we visited La Pau Sat, only a select few places were open because it was the day after Chinese New Year. We did not know the name of this eating area at the time. After this recent visit, I now can associate La Pau Sat. On this visit, we did not really think about it until we saw the crowds while walking from the Downtown Station on the Downtown Line. We arrived at noon, the height of the lunchtime crowd. This was the first time I finally saw the packet-of-tissue as a place holder. My mom was about to take a couple of seats until I told her that they had already been reserved. I should have tried it with the packet of Singapore Airline peanuts I had in my bag I saved as a necessary snack. Some of the things I got to enjoy were the Chicken Rice as well as Fried Hokkien Mee. As a cool down, I enjoyed a mango shake as well as packaged watermelon pieces. This is such a fun place to visit and plenty of different stalls to try! I will try them all on my next visit."
,,Clean and many food varieties,4.0,,"Went on a weekday around 11am and they were not many people. Place was very clean for a hawker center and food varieties ranged from fast food chains to local and international dishes. Food prices were generally less than SGD10. The large fans were cooling and the chiming clock-tower was a nice touch.

Just a short walk from Downtown Station."
,,Significantly better than before,4.0,,"I've previously never been a big fan of Lau Pa Sat, but post the renovations I have to concede that it is looking a lot better. Visiting outside of peak hours is also a much mroe pleasant experience as it's not necessary to battle the crowds in order to get something to eat. Worth a visit at lunchtime though to fully experience the atmosphere of one of Singapore's best known hawker centres."
,,Satay Time.,2.0,,"We went for the night time satays, but were disappointed in the quality of the food as well as being hassled to sit and pick a particular vendor. Part of the fun is to walk amongst the acrid smoke and smells of the barbecuing meat, all eerily lit by flames from the grills. Then pick your vendor of choice from which to purchase your meal. We ended up doing this, leaving behind some seemingly unhappy touts. we did end up choosing out own stall, and enjoyed what we got, but felt that it didn't quite live up to our expectations. The meat was tough and over cooked, while it was difficult to discern what was what. S$38.00 saw us served 10 spicy prawn sticks and 30 mixed satays, so at least pricing was good. Team that with an icy cold beer (S$19.00 jug) and all in all it was something we can now tick off of our list. Been there, done that, but wouldn't rush back."
,,Such a variety of food!,4.0,,"This is a great choice for lunch or dinner, particularly if with a family or group of people and everyone wants different types of food. So many choices from pizza, pastries, satay, curries, Chinese, Wendy's burgers, etc. etc. The pavilion is a buzzing hive of activity with a great vibe and all sorts of delicious aromas."
,,"Fairly standard fare, except the satays",3.0,,"Maybe I’ve changed rather than this place changing, but since my last visit 10 years ago the gloss certainly seems to have come off the place. The satay sticks were still the highlight, but a lot of the other food is pretty straightforward stuff. Having said that, it doesn’t claim to be anything more so if you enjoy satay and want a cheap meal, it is worth dropping by."
,,Cheap/average local food,2.0,,Didn't really enjoy this place. It's gets too crowded at night. And the quality of local food here is pretty average.
,,Authentic dinning experience in Singapore - revamped!,4.0,,"Lau Pa Sat has recently been refurbished and it brings a better dinning experience. The centre is now clean and well lit, with good amenities surrounding the place. Highly recommended to go and sit on the outside street area and enjoy hundreds of satay with your friends!"
,,Cheap eats,3.0,,"The building is beautiful so although it's a food court, it's much more atmospheric than the shopping centre food courts so ubiquitous in SG.
There's plenty of choices of cuisine: Indian (veg & non-veg), Vietnamese, Chinese etc, even pig organs and a drink called ""ice milo Susu"". The food itself is cheap and decent, if not the finest you'll ever eat. The portion sizes can vary from stall to stall though.
It's an easily accessible place in the heart of town with something for all tastes. Watch out for packets of baby wipes on the tables - that's how the locals reserve their seats. Move them at your peril!"
,,"Eat, Eat, and Eat",5.0,,"It's a big food fest market with heritage building. Any kind of Asian food, name it, and you can find it all in here with reasonable price. Even this place is big and full, but not feel crowded because the heritage building has a high ceiling. Take a picture in some spots in here. It's cute!"
,,Lovely refurbished building,4.0,,This old Victorian building has been sensitively restored and refurbished and now is home to a wide range of small food outlets. Worth a visit.
,,Once is never enough,5.0,,"Locals or Tourists alike, its a must visit for anyone who is into FOOD.
Every possible local dish in as many variants can be found here. Post renovation, the place has a much better feel and is more comfortable.
The satay street adds to the old world charm of the place. Dont know if there is any better option that satays off the charcoal grills alongwith chilled beer. Its divine !!
nestled in the central business district, it plays host to the office goers during the day and late workers / tourists / local gorumands after sunset.
No trip to Singapore would be complete without a visit to Lau Pa Sat !!"
,,VALUE FOR MONEY,5.0,,"VERY happy with the value at this lovely "" traditional "" street style food emporium
Clean, tidy, good food at very reasonable rices a MASSIVE selection and close to the MRT ( we walked ) MA & PA type establishments - very quick service absolutely reccomend a visit"
,,All the Hawkers,5.0,,"This was recommended to us by a local and it did not disappoint. Not far from the MRT stop. All the hawkers under one roof. Great value and the opportunity to taste test many dishes. Avoid those that come to your table, seek out those that have long lines. We found the Japanese and the Korean to be the best."
,,Enjoy the aroma of old Singapore - al fresco Satays and cold beer,4.0,,"The development of Singapore often meant that the city is overrun with modern European style fusion eateries while the delicacies of Old Singapore could only be found with the assistance of locals. Lau Pa Sat is a renovated Victorian vintage market into a food court right in the middle of the CBD. This food court services the multitude of office workers during working days. The stampede of office workers at lunch time has to be seen to be appreciated. BUT when the sun sets, one of the street is closed off, and out come the traditional Satay stalls of old. For those who remember the good old days, of the street stall Satay stalls at old Alhambra Cinema at Beach Road, this is where they have relocated to. Generations may have past, but the wonderful aroma of hot oil and barbequed met on hot charcoal still evoke nostalgia of cheap eats of by gone years.

We were a party of 11, with 5 children from Sydney. We arrived on our first night in Singapore, with shorts and T-shirts to savour the experience. Important that you do not arrive over dressed as the smell of satay cooking will permeate through your hair and clothing. We ate till our heart content with satays, roti prata, and mee gorent. All washed down with plenty of ice water and jugs of cold Tiger Beer. The kids had a great time and experience. What a wonderful way to enjoy Singapore on our first night there."
,,Good & variety Indian Veg as well as non-veg food,4.0,,We tried food here and is walkable (750 M) from Merlion. This place has more than 6 Indian stalls and some are pure Veg. Tested good non-veg food here Milind
,,High End Hawker Center,5.0,,"Post renovation, this place is sleek and yet maintains its Victorian roots.

The food ranges from very cheap to as expensive as you want (ordering seafood, etc).

Compared to Newton, it is much less of a rip off in terms of being a ""touristy"" place -- maybe because it services so much of the downtown office district who keep them on their toes.

If you are going to eat at one Hawker Center in Singapore, it should be this one -- for the ambiance and for the food."
,,Lau Pa Sat Festival Pavilion,4.0,,Cheap by any standards - if you couldn't find something you liked - you are a fussy B!!! Pig's Organ soup didn't do it for me though.
,,Must Eat in Singapore,5.0,,"We were recommended this eatery by a Singaporean local and were not disappointed. The most difficult part is choosing what to eat, there are so many options! The variety was amazing and the prices just as good!"
,,Recently renovated - delicious cheap food,4.0,,"This recently renovated hawkers market offers you a chance to eat wonderful food really cheaply. The hardest thing is to decide which stall to go to, you have 54 to choose from!

Many Singaporeans eat their main meal at hawkers markets every day.

If you are new to Singapore do try the carrot cake (it's neither sweet nor does it have carrot in it!). Instead it is made with Daikon ( a white radish) and more resembles a frittata than anything else. There are 2 versions, white and black - the black is slightly sweeter due to the addition of soy sauce. If you haggle they may give you a half portion of each."
,,Best Satays,5.0,,Came here for tea one night very busy but they will find you a seat. Enjoyed a variety of satays rice and vegatable dishes at a very good price. This place is a must if visiting Singapore. I will be back.
,,Satay Paradise,5.0,,"Grab a satay at Best Satay #8! Worth the wait in line and watching these guys smash out hundreds of sticks of deliciousness was quite entertaining to watch. Great value for money and huge choice of food stalls, I also managed to get a chicken rice for $4."
,,Upmarket hawker centre offering good value food,4.0,,"Nicely converted hawker centre with an excellent selection of restaurants offering good value food and drinks. Generally kept cleaner than many hawker centres and with indoor and outdoor seating available. Features many satay restaurants too each competing to offer the best satay. Jugs of Tiger beer were reasonable value for money. As someone who still enjoys Newton Circus, LPS offers better value for money but not quite the same atmosphere overall. If you are staying in the city then LPS is the one to choose. Highly recommended in a city with too many overpriced restaurants."
,,Good food and good price,4.0,,"Former market converted into Hawker, is a wonderful option to eat in the heart of Singapore, you can find food from anywhere in the world, clean, well lighted place, currently there are fans and every hour sounds like a clock. Do not forget to bring napkins, there only sell food and drink. On the outside of the market are small Satay stalls, you ask them what you want and they bring to the table."
,,Hawker Heaven!,4.0,,"Food here is great-if you like your street food, If you like your satay's, you'll love it here. Come at night, Boon Tat street has tables where you can sit and eat. Selection is great (beef,chicken,prawn etc). They also cater for Indian and Asian cuisine. You can crab a juice or one or the beer waitresses will grab you a beverage. Good ambiance for families or friends."
,,Fantastic choice,4.0,,"We were advised to go here to experience some good local food, we were not disappointed. There was so much choice it took ages to decide what to eat. For 4 of us it cost around $30 for main, fresh squeezed juice and dessert, what a bargain. This was definitely the cleanest, most organised and best value over all hawker market we visited. Recommended."
,,Awesome Food,4.0,,The food here is great. You get so many varieties to choose from. More time will be spent in deciding which stall to visit to. Amazing taste and value for $$.
,,Large selection and reasonable price,3.0,,"Was it a great experience, not exactly. It was nice to be able to have this huge selection. However, the food wasn't that great and I feel as though it wasn't as authentic. Nevertheless, it was clean and convenient"
,,GO HERE!!!,5.0,,"The food here was so cheap! My husband and I ate lunch here for less than S$10 total! And the food was so good!!! The selection was HUGE!!!! You will have a hard time deciding where you should eat. And, as with everything in Singapore, it was SO CLEAN! I normally don't eat street food, because the quality is.....street food. But everything here was so clean and organized and they have to live up to health codes. It's great. Great food, great experience. Go here is you're a tourist, or even a local!"
,,Food Haven!,5.0,,"Lau Pa Sat is the first hawker market area in Singapore. Now it's been over shadowed by places like Makansutra Gluttons Bay. Recently Lau Pa Sat underwent renovation and for me it's become a better place to eat in. Why?

- More food choices (and try to canvass around as price differs from restaurant)
- Better ventilation (they have fans around)
- Choice of indoor or outdoor.
- Its well lit.

However, i think Makansutra has a better location and better view (Marina Bay)."
,,Best sate in the city,4.0,,"During night time Boon Tat street south of the Lau Pa Sat is blocked out to give way for an open air hawker. The road is filled out with tables and chairs for people to eat BBQ food. It create an unique ambience and feeling when you eat your food surrounded by lighting and tall buildings. The best sate is served by stand 7and 8. Try chicken, mutton and prawn sate."
,,Singapore - food and shopping,4.0,,Lau pa sat is a old food centre and well.known for its local singapore food. It has since been refurbished and upgraded but the food is remains good quality and if you want to experience singapore food court cuisine this is one of the place.
,,options options options,4.0,,"what amazes me in SG is the number of food choices available may it be indian, chinese, japanese, thai and malay etc. but i think the crown for mother of all hawkers should be awarded to this place. its huge but its clean and there's a lot of tables available. we are always able to find a seat no matter how busy the time of the day is. i specifically like the bbq stalls at the back. they sell delicious satays. its a bit of a walk from the raffles mrt station, use exit I. and just like any other hawkers, they do not handout tissues so better bring your own. i have only tried some of the stalls but will definitely come back to try them all out"
,,Value for money,4.0,,"After undergoing a recent million dollar renovation, we were immediately impressed at first sight, there must have been 50 permanent food stalls in front of our eyes. I don't know how many times I walked around trying to decide what I wanted, every stall looked so good. If you’re after traditional, authentic, value for money local food that hasn’t been dulled down to suit a tourist palate - this is the place to head. Noodle dishes, dim sum selections, delicious hot and spicy Asian flavours, strange and wonderful foreign feasts, you’ll find it very very hard to decide and I can almost bet on it that you won’t be disappointed."
,,singapore must,4.0,,definitely the right place if you need just a snack or a complete meal... evry kind of cuisine available...!!
,,Disappointed,1.0,,Our second hawker store visit during our visit in Singapore. The price was expensive but the quality was not as good. It felt like a food court for the office workers to go to for lunch.
,,Cost of Renovation reflected in increased Costs,3.0,,"It used to be where hawker food was abundant in Singapore, but gradually these have been closed down and Lau Pa Sat is probably the best in the CBD area.

It has undergone renovation and is looking a lot better. As per other reviews Best Satay Stalls 7&8 is the best to try. The food is good without doubt, but what used to be good quality street food at reasonable prices, has now become an opportunity to hike up the prices materially. It is still not expensive compare to other establishments, but it's not what it was."
,,Lau Pa Sat has great variety of Singaporean food,4.0,,"Lau Pa Sat has an excellent variety of food stalls, most under cover. In the centre is a place where you can get fresh squeezed sugar cane juice which was very refreshing. We had satay in the 'satay street' outside the pavilion, from stall 6 - a mix of prawn, beef and chicken and a rice cake (ketupat) for $32. A couple of paratha with egg from an Indian stall. And to finish off, teh tarik which translates as 'pulled tea'; the maker pours the tea from one receptacle to another in as long a stream as possible, which looks quite spectacular with a skilled maker. The whole thing was not hugely cheap, but very reasonable all the same."
,,Cheap,5.0,,"Enjoyed several meals here, which were priced really cheap about $5.50 a great way to recover some over spending of the day. An amazing variety of foods. A burger place as well for the kids who don't enjoy the spicy hawker food. Highly recommend."
,,Hot and nice food there,4.0,,"Inside the Lau Pa Sat is a lot of food store and recommended to eat their food and was nice to eat

I would recommend the food during midnight to try their satay cost around $30 plus that come with prawns , satay and rice cake."
,,Fun casual experience,5.0,,"Decided to check out 'Satay Street' after watching Tom & Bens Singapore Sling on #7, glad we did as we weren't disappointed. Chose our food from 'Best Satay 7&8' - it was well cooked, very tasty and more than enough (we couldn't finish it all). Vendors weren't too pushy and we found them friendly and polite. For a crowded street it wasn't too cramped and it was lovely to enjoy a local treat under the stars in the middle of the city."
,,Authentic .,5.0,,"We have been here a few times and it is always so good. Finding a table was easy enough even at dinner. We love the mutton murtbak, black carrot cake, chicken rice and satay sticks, to wash it down go for either lime juice or sugar cane juice, yum. Tip: bring your own napkins and wet wipes."
,,Best Satay stall 7 & 8,4.0,,we all went down to Lau Pa Sat for some satay and we certainly were not disapointed. Hawker food at its best. We went to stall 7 & 8 which had the best satay. It had featured on Tom and Bens Singapore adventure on channel 7. There are a number of meats you can choose from and if you are looking for something other than satay they have pretty much everything and its a nice cheap meal.
,,Best Hawker Food,5.0,,"My husband & I feel very lucky that this Hawker Market was recently reopened. Its the place to go for variety & quality at very very decent peices.
We have had Chinese, Malay & Indian food. Our expectations have always been met.
Due to recent renovations the market feels very clean & tidy. It has wonderful high ceilings & open feel. My husbsnd was working in an office close by & he ate here more than 5+ times during our 2 week visit to Singapore."
,,Worse than before,2.0,,"Its just as stuffy but the food is expensive, portion too little and the service is appalling. Was at the dessert stall, but after waiting and finally tell the lady what I wanted, she continued with her washing at the sink."
,,Good variety of food,3.0,,The market had opened again by July when we visited. Good variety of food and unique experience outdoors. Less value for money than other food markets in Chinatown which are less crowded
,,Overrated,3.0,,We went here as we had heard good things. We found the experience to be overrated. We ordered from stalls 7 & 8 - beef prawn & chicken. All it was was BBQ meat on skewers with a small cup of satay to dip the skewer into. The beer was $20 a jog for tiger beer.
,,Barbecue for an OWL,4.0,,"Never get bored eating barbecue Satay at this place...
Recommend you to try BEST SATAY stall no 7 - 8 as they meat, especially prawn are fresh.

Located in financial district/area of Singapore,...
You will never realize that this is a busy-car street on day-light as in the evening; they closed the street and open a SATAY stall and operate only during weekend and/or public holiday.

Can not give any recommendation on the opening time as we are an OWL and always end up ate there between 11pm - 2am...

Open air place with sky as the roof create a different atmosphere for affordable eating place in Singapore which is perfect to spend dinner + weekend hang out with friends, families, lovers [if one of your friends, families member not into SATAY, Chinese + Indian food stall also available].

Now, as lots of construction-redecorating going on in Singapore here and there.
The LAU PA SAT food center also get affected with it, however you can not really notice it since the construction work only going on during day-light."
,,Renovation worth.,1.0,,"I am a tourist and I have been to Singapore on many occasions. Lau Pa Sat food festival is one of my favorite eating places cos I really like the satay street open concept. I was there in December last year unfortunately Lau Pa Sat was under renovation and I was told the renovation works will take another month so I would expect it to be completed in January/February 2014. I m here now in Singapore since last week and again I visited Lau Pa Sat and to my frustration, the renovation works are still not completed. Several days ago I read an article published in the straits times wherein it said Lau Pa Sat is not ready yet . The management has spent SGD 4 million for the renovation works. I wish to highlight that this is a monument in Singapore and having spent SGD 4 million,:the roof which in bad shape is still not replaced. Is the management looking into this? Is this not part of the renovation works as it appears to me that the image of Lau Pa Sat with this kind of roof is down to earth. Just sharing my personal opinion based on the article i've read with this SGD 4Million worth of renovation for this kind of eating place. Up to date it's still close."
,,A delicious fun place,4.0,,"Downtown Singapore, streetwise food festival. The best satey you can get! The best place before hit the clubs, to have fun with friends and have delicious streetfood for less sitting outside. Cash only!"
,,Satay at its best,5.0,,"While the pavilion is closed for renovations, satay street is alive and well on the street next door. Right in the Central Business District amongst the skyscrapers, at night a regular street closes down, tons of tables and plastic chairs come out, and street vendors cook fabulous satay in roadside stands. The beef, prawns, and chicken satay were out of this world!"
,,Interesting and yummy dining experience,4.0,,"We found the idea of eating on the street in the middle of a business area quite interesting. But the food definitely does not disappoint either. When we got off the cab, we were immediately shown menus by a waiter and it seems every single server will try to persuade you to eat at their stall (but not to the point that they harass you like in other places).

Most of the stalls sold satay (chicken, beef, mutton, mushroom, etc.) at 10pcs for $6 but there were also stalls that sold chicken wings, roti, char kwa teoy, etc. so there is a lot to choose from. There is beer and a lot of different drinks (we loved the Rose Milk tea!) including the usual tea tarik, lychee juice and lemon tea.

Unfortunately when we went the main pavilion was still closed for renovation we heard it will open in June of this year but we were not disappointed because the satay dinner we had was soooo good! It is walking distance to the Merlion park as well so that was a good as well."
,,Best Satay in Singapore,4.0,,"The satay stands are still open every night from 7pm till late. Great atmosphere for everyone, we take work colleagues, family members and groups of friends. The best satay stand is number 8, we've tried them all. Their's have the best flavours and the prawns are shelled for you, a really friendly family run stand."
,,Closed. Visit other Hawker Centres Nearby.,3.0,,"Lau Pa Sat (Old Market) is closed for renovations and there are no clear indications on when it will open. This place is opened and priced for tourists.

Suggest other food centres nearby like Maxwell (Take to Chinatown train station), Newton Circus (Newton MRT) or Old Airport Road Food Centre (Dakota MRT). If you're an adventurous tourists, head to the heartlands such as Bishan, Ang Mo Kio or Clementi. Equally good."
,,under renovation - try Newton Circus,2.0,,"simply put, Lau Ps Sst is shut down for a rebuild, so go try somewhere else. the side street that open s at Night is ok, but Newtown Circus or Maxwell Road would be better"
,,"Good Food, Great Value!",4.0,,"They don't call it the ""Festival Pavillion"" for nothing! The hawker center has a very festive feel around it. It was well-lighted and very easy to locate (it's a block away from Raffles station). During lunch and dinner time, the place fills up pretty quickly but since it's very spacey and has lots of seats and tables it's pretty easy to find a place to settle down. There are lots of food stalls for you to choose from offering a variety of cuisine-- Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Malaysian, and even Western choices! We were quickly gravitated towards this certain Chinese seafood stall which sells the famous Singapore Chili Crab (a MUST-TRY!) for a good price (SD12.00 for one piece; SD45.00 for two pieces). Beside it is an Indian food stall from which we ordered Roti Prata and kebabs.

The only fault we found was regarding the place's cleanliness (there were little bits of thrash here and there and some tables were not cleaned immediately, but eventually these little concerns were settled). We do understand that it's a big place to maintain, though."
,,Still closed but satay available,3.0,,LPS is still closed for renovations with no indication of when it will reopen. The saving grace is that every night at 7 pm (3 pm on weekends) Boon Tat next to LPS is blocked off and about a dozen satay vendors set up their stalls with tables in the street. It's a great place to sample as much satay as you can eat!
,,Dissappointing,2.0,,"Unfortunately Lau Pa Sat was being refurbished on our visit. The feel from the stall holders and taxi drivers was that the landlords were pushing the rent up way to much making it difficult for the vendors.

Its a shame as we have found it a good place for larger groups or families to go mingle have a feed and a drink."
,,Open Yes or No?,2.0,,Since long we went several times to lao pa sat and were more then satisfied with tis excellent Food. But since 2011 the LPS was always closed... the few foodstalls right beside the LPS are not really an Option!... missing the the special athmosphere... check carefully if the LPS is open in advance when closed Forget this place!
,,Even the locals love it,5.0,,"An array of local delicacies await visitors here! Even the locals love it!

Come in the evening after 6pm for the satay stalls. My favourite is stall no 1, Fatman satay, they minced the meat before stewing it up, so at your bite, the succulent meat simply melts in your mouth. You have to dip it in the peanut curry sauce that goes with it. Sides like onions, cucumbers and the malay rice cakes go well with it."
,,Yum!,4.0,,"Yummy hawker style, street markets if you like satay. We walked there after checking out the Merlion and ordered a mix of prawn, chicken and beef satay sticks and an icy cold beers for parents and cold drinks for the kids. Yum and great atmosphere."
,,Satay and Beer,4.0,,"Lau Pa Sat has a very unique atmosphere. Its a mixture of people eating a different hawker foods, drinking beer and socialising. The smells and sounds are mouth watering. I have visited LPS numerous occasions and personally I go to the Satay Stalls situated just around the side. My favourite is Fatman Satay as the meat is generally tender and cooked correctly. On this visit we ordered Mutton and Chicken and I would recommend this as if you are new to this concept you do not want to miss out.The dipping sauce is also much better than others I have tried, although a little place on Grange Rd is equally as good. If you like your Roti Paratha's or Char Keuy you can also get this here. As with most Hawkers centre's hygiene should be put to one side as the turnover of people is massive. The location is great and if you exit Raffles Place MRT its about a 5-10 minute walk."
,,Lau Pa Sat still close,4.0,,Went to Lau Pa Sat on the 01 December but the place is still close. No doubt some write up mentioned it will reopen by Nov/Dec 2013 but looks like there is an indefinite date/month to it.
,,Satay Street is the main dishes by now,4.0,,"Since the Lau Pa Sat is redecorating. it's a beautiful building but is closed, so you just can have those Satay food beside it, It starts every night from 7pm, It tastes very good, and always in a Set. so you can go there for your dinner, and you'll not regret it."
,,Beer & Satay........ nice,4.0,,Went there during October unfortunately i was been renovated not to sure if it is open again however could experiencing the total affect of it... overall had some good beer and satay with a couple of friends...need i mention a very peaceful and quiet atmosphere (could be actually since we went there quite late in the night)
,,expect the best food Singapore has to offer.,5.0,,"The Good =) ~Opens from early morning to post-dinner times. ~Gd variety. The Bad =( ~Because of high rentals, some dishes are over-priced. My Tip for future visits: ~Walk 2 rounds inspecting all food choices & make a decision later."
,,Pavillion closed but the street stalls are still open!,4.0,,"My husband really wanted me to experience the food hawkers in Singapore and this was one place he really wanted me to see. We had heard that the Pavillion was closed so he rang them and they advised that although the pavillion is undergoing refurbishing the street stalls are still open. We arrived early and walked along the street watching the cooking start. Then right on the dot of 7pm the street closed and tables and chairs were madly positioned in front of each stall. Such an interesting experience! We were quickly ushered to a table and chairs arrived. We were sitting in front of stall number 10. We ordered a mixed set and the beer girl arrived with a jug and two glasses. The mixed set included prawns, lamb, duck and chicken. I walked along the road looking at the other stalls while my husband finished the jug of beer. We decided to try another stall and after awhile decided on stall number 6 as the girl was very lovely and found us another table. This end of the street was the busiest end so we thought the stalls here must have the best food. We ordered another selection set and was not disappointed. One more jug of beer and we were done for the night. Stall number 7/8 advertises food awards. We will give them a try next time! A quick walk to Raffles MRT station for the train to our hotel. This was my last night in Singapore and left me with great memories."
,,more of the name than the food,3.0,,"Eating here is really more of the place. The food choices here are more varied than other hawkers center. I didn't find the food that our group ordered any special. In fact, I find the food in other hawkers better than here. So its really...More"

,,Avoid going inside,2.0,,"avoid going inside,,dirty place,overly aggressive barkers follow you around pushing their menues. food was not really good. Better sit outside where the satay stalls are located"
,,Nice ambience,4.0,,"My wife and I went after 7.30pm when they close down the street. After seeing other reviews we went for the set A from stall 7-8. The satay was good with beef, chicken and prawn sticks. There was a beer wench and we also had fried rice. However this is not the best satay I have had. The old satay club in Singapore was better. Cost of satay with rice was $30. A good night out when in Singapore. Also very friendly staff. One tip, make sure you take your own napkins as they are not supplied."
,,Good selection of very tasty food,4.0,,"Local friend invited us to experience Lau Pa Sat in the evening when side-street is closed and multiple satay places work there. Unfortunately satay were not very good, but other food - omelette with oysters, noodles, laksa, fish - very fresh and tasty. Probably cheapest beer in Singapore. Atmosphere was amazing as well...
We really liked it and went for the second time few days later. This time we gave a miss to satay and enjoyed tasty food again... The selection is huge - local, Malaysian, Vietnamese, Indian, Korean, Indonesian cuisines just few to name... There were many locals in business suits having food after work at the Pavilion. To us it was clear indication of good quality food.
Definitely would go there again..."
,,No frills but worth a visit,4.0,,"Cheap, local tasty cuisine in a simple street market type environment. Was a little scruffier than I was expecting with very simple tables and chairs but on the whole generally clean and a good atmosphere. Good mix of food and a variety of local foods to meet all taste! Worth a visit if in Singapore for a few days!!!"
,,cheap good food!,4.0,,"Lau Pa Sat has great tasting food from a variety of cuisines, representing Singapore's diverse menu options at an affordable price. Its not cushy seats or anything like that but its a great authentic experience and there are fans aplenty to keep you comfortable. Highly recommended to try at least once. The architecture alone is fascinating, plus you're close to Raffles."
,,If you like eating outside and want a nice selection of clean different foods and drink served until very late go here,4.0,,"I love the atmosphere of this place it's got a real buzz to it. It is not luxury but sitting on plastic tables and chairs whilst different vendors of food and drink come to your table to offer their produce. It is not luxury but it is good food and a great way to get lots of variety in one meal. You will see over a dozen satay places. I always go to number 5. i like the skate, crispy squid, pepper beef, sweet and sour fish but there are loads of good things to try. This is not a fancy restaurant but a good experience which you should try. Good clean inexpensive ( for Singapore anyway) but go for the atmosphere and the experience. I have been 20+ times and love it."
,,Cheap and loads to choose from,4.0,,$10 for two meals! Very fast and fresh food. Packed full of locals and tourists. We caught a taxi from the Raffles Blvd to get here and it cost under $10. We ended up walking back along the river stopping at the Merlion and Fullerton Bays hotel and esplanade. A great evening. Everything is so close when you work out where it is.
,,Authentic Singapore Eating Experience,4.0,,"We've eaten in Lau Pa Sat on a number of occassions and have always found it to be clean. The satay stalls line the pavement outside and are very good, last night we had mixture of chicken and beef satay.

There are many, many stalls offering food from all over asia. For example, last night on our table of 4 we had chicken satays, pho bo from Vietnam, a laksa, prawn dumplings and fresh spring rolls.

Be prepared to do a lap first trying to work out what you want to eat. The choice is endless. Great fun, great experience."
,,So many choices......,4.0,,"I had a fried oyster cake there from a stall called Lai Heng - it was a little on the oily side, but that is probably to be expected from an oyster cake. The oysters were so tasty tho, they use full size oysters, not the tiny ones and they sort of throw it in there last minute to pan fry it a little, and serve them almost sitting on top of the ""cake"".

Personally i love Filipino food, and i was surprised to see that there were a bunch of filipino food stalls there - try if you like pinoy food/have some space (which i sadly did not)

Also as everyone is saying, there is a satay street outside, again i had no more space in my stomach so i did not try but a tip: MINIMUM ORDER OF SATAYS IS 10. so if you cant eat 10 then..... you might have to skip it like me :(

The actual physical location is really really impressive. I have to say it is worth going, the outside is beautiful, as well as the inside."
,,"Satay, Satay, Satay",4.0,,"I ate at the Lau Pa Sat pavilion for dinner on a Saturday night after spending lunch at the Maxwell Road Food Center. I was surprised to find the place not very crowded at 7:00pm, but that was a good surprise. I went straight for the satay since this was supposed to be the highlight of th hawker stalls. I ate at best satay 7&8 and had the chicken and beef. I thought both were very good and especially liked the dipping sauce for the chicken satay. I was by myself and found the XS portions to be perfect for one. After the satay, I had black carrot cake from a vendor inside the pavilion, which was equally good, but after the satay, was a bit much. I wandered around before making any selections and found this set of stalls to have more ethnic food selections (Korean, Indian, Vietnamese, Malay) compared to the Maxwell Road Food Center. Overall, I thought the satay was worth the visit (you can also get prawns, mutton or other things that I did not try). If you find that there is nothing for you, there is a Wendy's on site - if that's your thing."
,,Enjoy good in Singapore way !,5.0,,"Probably this was the first place to eat which was introduced to me when I came to Singapore . Since it is in the central business district(CBD) you will find everyone from the office eating here.
Best part is you will find all variety of food from Indian , Chinese, Korean, western and local cuisine at the reasonable price .

Be prepared before visiting this place on weekdays lunch time , it will be difficult to find a seat and you will find people standing on your head waiting next to you.
How we reserve the seat for ourselves when ordering food is just placing a newspaper , a pack of tissues.

If you visit Singapore do visit this place and enjoy it."
,,Not very nice satay,3.0,,"The best satay in Singapore is still East Coast Park. Lau pa sat is nowhere near that. The meat was fatty not tasty, not well marinated, the dipping sauce was nice. Every stall was the same not good"
,,Just so so,3.0,,"not so special. The price is a bit higher than foodcourt in Maxwell - Chinatown. I try satay (outside) and the taste is just fine. The location near Merlion/ Rafless MRT, just about 10 minutes walk."
,,Nice place for Satay,4.0,,"Go to stall 7 & 8 for their satay. Order deep friend squid as well, but I don't know which stall it is from."
,,Touristy Hawker Centre with less than exceptional food,3.0,,"On our three night stay at Singapore we ate at three different hawker centres and Lau Pa Sat was easily the worst. It is the most famous (I believe) in Singapore which has brought in a lot of tourists but sadly the quality isn't up to par with the others. Go to see the heritage site but the food isn't anything to rave about.

It's famous for its satays but when we were there the satays were nothing but dry tasteless meat (we ordered from Stall 7/8)."
,,A must in Singapore!,5.0,,"A great place for street food, a real Asian experience.
Very reasonably priced and good food.
We started off having satay (on satay street), store 7 and 8. Amazing! We shared a large plate between 3 as a starter. 20 sticks was $12!!!
We all then chose individually from different vendors and met together at a table in the middle. I had a minced meat noodle dish, which was delicious. It cost $3.50!!!!
We can't wait to go back again!"
,,A special slice of Singapore,4.0,,"We had a lovely meal at Lau Pa Sat. The building alone is worth looking out. The tables were clean and there is a wide range of food available. We had murtabek, nice and freshly-made, satays - delicious and lots of them - and a noodle soup with roasted duck. All were very tasty and washed down with jugs of Tiger beer. Tip: serviettes are in short supply so either take a supply of wet wipes or buy some some from the man who wanders round selling them. We did neither and ended up wearing quite a bit of the food! A great experience and we would definitely go again."
,,Worthwhile to try different satays,4.0,,"We went here solely for the satay street - the rest of the pavillion did not look very attractive. Each stall has a number, so if you know where to get your food from that will make it a lot easier. We got our satay from 7 & 8 (which was recommended to us by a friend) and were not disappointed - enjoyed it thoroughly, as well as the business of the place. For a couple of hours this s a very crowded place, full of people eager to try the best satays."
,,Tastes from around the world,5.0,,"We loved this hawker center, although is at the financial city the place is really nice, the setting is tradititonal and you can have a taste of different parts of the world. We recommend the corner with the old stalls: Korean, Chinese, Vietnamese, howkien, the most traditional are the better and you can try great Singapore Specialties like laksa or Fried Rice Hokkien and great fresh spring rolls (our favorites) from the viet stall."
,,Preferred Newtons,3.0,,"This hawker centre was recommended by a taxi driver, his opinion was that it was better and cheaper than Newtons. The centre has a variety of vendors, we had both BBQ Prawns and BBQ Octopus from one of the outside stalls which was good, then Satay Chicken and Satay Beef also from an outside stall the satays were delicious and it was a generous serve for the money, that was out starters done. We walked through the inside and were not really happy with state of the place, so we headed back to Newtons."
,,Authentic experience,5.0,,"Beats Newton hawker centre hands down. Much more authentic, and less touristy. many food choices - some more western-style than others - be adventurous! Sorry we didn't get another chance to go back."
,,"Famous, cheap & beer....all you need to know",4.0,,"As clueless foreigners we stumbled onto the Lau Pa Sat Food Pavilion near the Raffles Place MRT. It is a large undercover food mall with over 30 stalls. Singapore is famous for its claim as the unofficial capital of SE Asia, a crossroads of cultures which share linked pasts & intertwined futures, this is most true here as food from all these representatives from Malay, Chinese, South Indian, Japanese, Korean, Thai & Vietnamese can be found.

What sets it apart from other large food mall is firstly its heritage status as a 100 year old building with pretty iron pillars & high roof helping to ventilate the large area. There isn’t modern aircon but the atmosphere, noise & fragrances of Asian street food makes for an interesting night of gastronomy. The price for the average dish is $3 to $6 SGD. People whinging about Lau Pa Sat are crazy & especially harsh as there is plenty of variety here & the prices aren’t something to complain about. You can find fresh grilled chicken satay skewers, 20 different Won Ton Soup varieties, Malaysian & Indonesian Rendangs, Vietnamese Pho, spicy Laksa, Tom Yum Goong, Indian Samosa’s or Singapore Chilli Mud Crab. Thankfully, you won’t find poorly cooked backpacker pizza or pancakes here. There’s a famous saying that people eat with their eyes but Lau Pa Sat is a place where you can choose with your nose.

Pros: large variety of food, most stalls feature pictures of dishes-point & nod, really cheap, freshly cooked, very nice heritage building, lively atmosphere, Saturday night jazz band, close to Telok Ayer St & Raffles MRT station, grilled satay chicken is cooked fresh outside on hot coals, very safe & family friendly, tables are cleared by workers, good for Australian tastes, good opportunity to try new flavours, female friendly, plenty of tables, perfect for large groups

Cons: no air-con, cash only- stalls don’t use electronic banking, Saturday evenings can be hard to find table, self-service, no hamburgers, Europeans won't find potatoes or pasta here, only 1 beer station, no beer wenches, smoking is allowed undercover here"
,,Love that bbq meat on a stick,3.0,,"The stalls inside the pavilion serve a variety of foods that are cheap, tasty and fill you up. The setting is good for people watching, although the pavilion looks as though it could use a good scrub.

Arrive after 7pm... that's when they close off one of the outside streets and turn it into a satay strip. The satay is dearer than the pavilion stalls (About $20pp compared with about $5pp). I ate here twice during my July 2013 Singapore holiday - I took my parents (in their 70s and not intrepid travellers) and they loved it for the atmosphere and variety. My first satay experience was better than the first, but I'd still go back. There's something about that bbq'd meat on a stick that I just can't say no to."
,,Not so great food except chicken rice.,3.0,,"Nice choice of foods, but some staffs were not even smiling nor accommodating, kinda different compared to other food pavilions maybe because of the ambiance, chicken rice is superb."
,,Worth a visit but food is not exceptional,3.0,,"It is true that it gets more and more difficult to enjoy real tasty hawker food in Singapore nowadays, and the same goes for satay unfortunately. Some of the stalls are not bad (though the murtabak was really disappointing) but if I had to pick a tourist spot where food is more pricey, I think I'd rather move to Chinatown or even Newton rather than be stuck in a tiny road with absolutely no view, save for the replica of the lau pa sat market. If you happen to be in the neighbourhood, like we were, it can be an option"
,,Great food and great atmosphere,5.0,,"It is in an old fashioned building. There is loads of atmosphere and is a vibrant place to visit and a whole range of Asian foods to choose from. I had satay sticks from one stall and the biggest plate of fried rice you would ever see from another. Just wander around before you make up your mind. Have a look at what other people are eating and then choose. My wife had a vegetable curry. There was nothing wishy washy about it, plenty of taste and spice. You can buy a beer or soft drink from the centre stall. There is a lot of competition and the serves were very generous. If you want a quiet, gentile place don’t go here. If you want a bit of fun and cheap, tasty food then make a visit. It is miles better than some of the up market food malls."
,,A must when going to Singapore,5.0,,"I haven't been to Singapore since 2008, but the Hawker Centers have always been in my mind since my last visit. Since I stay at Fullerton Hotel, which is only a 10 minute walk from Lau Pat Sat, I decided to pay a visit there the first evening. Many stalls were already closed for the night unfortunately and the place is a bit dirty. But then again, there is a certain charm in the place and the dirtiness is a part of a Hawker Center. We are not expecting to step in to a Michelin- starred restaurant anyway.
There are several different stalls and a broad variety of food! Had a hard time to decide where I should start from. The easiest way for me was to look at all the people what they were eating and then decide from there.

The food was as delicious as I remember it being in places like this. I went to several different stalls for food and drinks. Since all the people working at the stalls don't speak English, I just pointed at some picture and at the juice stand, I chose whatever the local people before me purchased. I ended up with bamboo juice or something similar like that which was actually quite good. I also had the best chicken in my life. So juicy and tender!
Will definitely go there again during my trip!"
,,Always fun and good food,5.0,,Took the family to Lau Pa Sat for their first taste of a Singapore food centre. All four of us loved the vivid environment and food.
,,best place to hang out after a stressful day at work,3.0,,"this place is at the Center of Singapore Business District. If you are Jogging from the Marina Bay Sands or just want to hang out after office, you can enjoy live bands and alot of food selections . I 1st tasted the Katchang here."
,,The place is kind of run down with lots of stalls closed,3.0,,"The place is quite dirty too. You can go try out the place if you don't mind the dirty sight and unhygienic look of the place. Though it is open space, it is quite hot eating in there."
,,A must do in Singapore!,5.0,,"Huge food court with tastes and meals for everyone ! You can find chinese, thai, vietnamese, japanese, indian, indonesian, singaporean, etc etc... Located in the middle of CBD, you cannot leave SG without going!"
,,Best food court for evening meal,5.0,,Recommended by ex-pat fot after six dining when outside street is shut down and tables moved to street for dining. Beautiful renovated train station in heart of Singapore. Don't miss it.
,,Cultural and food experience,5.0,,"Pros: experience, multicultural, cheap, tasty food.

Amazing cultural and food experience. Dirty cheap and lots of variety. It's also interesting the ethnic diversity.
These food markets are a must try. You can not miss it.
We had noodles. It comes with an extra bowl that contains a meat broth, liver, pork and a boiled egg. DELICIOUS.
The place where we bought it looks one of the most popular places.
I felt like Bordain in his TV shows in Asia."
,,great place for satay and more!,4.0,,"The hawker side of this venue has plenty of variety and decent food and drink at great prices; the satay part, where you can sit outside on a cut-off street, is fantastic. It's busy and crowded and you have to run the phalanx of satay-hawkers -- so much fun! Cold beer right to your table, SGD18 for 25 sticks of satay. Been a few times now and love this place!"
,,Great Satay At Night,4.0,,Unfortunately I didnt get to visit more Hawker Centers. But this one was great. You especially need to go at night when they shut down one road and Satay stands open up. Great bargin and great food. Grab a jug of beer and grab some satay.
,,Cheap and Good Eats,4.0,,Went there on a recommendation and was not disappointed. 'Best Satay' Stalls 7&8 are the most popular and lived up to the expectation we had built. Fed a family of 4 on $24 including drinks all round. YUM
,,"Fantastic food, exciting atmosphere with potential pitfalls",4.0,,"Ideally, you want to visit Lao Pa Sat in the evening during or after sunset when the crowds come en masse to relax and indulge. It is quite a scene to be sitting outside amongst hundreds of people enjoying the excellent food and setting.

Upon arrival, you will likely be approached by countless ""hostesses"" with menus who will try to seat you and get you to buy directly and only from their food stall. AVOID these people. Take your time walking around the stalls and looking at the pictures of the food. You may very well want to order food from a variety of stalls. To do this, you will place your order directly at the stall and bring it back to a table.

Prices for many common items are similar across all stalls. However, you will find variation when it comes to foods charged by weight like crab. Be sure to agree upon a price for the crab that you select.

Yes, you can get a full meal here for under $10, but I suggest you indulge in some of the more pricy options like a beautifully large crab, which will cost more. The seafood is fresh (often still alive when you select it), and this is partially what makes Singapore such an awesome food destination.

If you do not want to eat with your hands or chopsticks, be sure to request silverware or seek it out in the pavilion. Rarely if at all are napkins/towels available to clean ones hands. Bring your own or wash your hands off at restrooms near the McDonald's (or was it a burger king?).

Don't forget to rinse it down with inexpensive (relative to all other alcohol prices) local beer. Sit back and take in the beautiful evening.

Prices here are more expensive than other hawker centers. However, few other hawker centers can provide the atmosphere that Lao Pa Sat provides in the evening.

Enjoy!"
,,"Eat local, its worth it.",5.0,,"If you only eat at one food court make it this one. Walk round, decide what you want by looking at the pictures, order it & take it to a table to eat. You have to ask for cutlery (locals use chopsticks or fingers) and there are no serviettes so take your own. Prices around S$4 - 8 for a full meal, its fast food like you've never seen or tasted. The place is full of financial district workers at lunchtime and sharing tables is the norm. There are toilets which are very clean but old. The road to the west of the building is closed to traffic at 7pm and the traditional street satay sellers set up tables & chairs actually on the road."
,,It changes so much now.,4.0,,"When you are there, avoid sitting tables with stall menu occupied. This is because when you sit on that table, its a must to purchase something from that stall. A wise tip is to ignore touting stall owners and approach a owner only when you are interested in that particular food they sell."
,,Fast & Fun street food served on the Street!,4.0,,"Adjacent to the antique covered Food stalls of Lau Pa Sat out on the street itself each night the ""local hawkers"" appear and serve on plastic chairs and rickety wooden tables (why is it that one table leg is always shorter?) but its fast and fun gourmet. From satay skewers to steaming Thai chili fish all is cooked and delivered in minutes to your table - pay cash only no credit cards or fancy RFD cash registers here! Great to see Singapore can still serve ""local"" style without the aircon. Lots of Raffles Place businessmen/women eat on the street so its not just for tourists. Walk back to Robinson road to catch a taxi its faster there."
,,Street food heaven,4.0,,"So many choices, so many types of food to try! The building dates to the colonial era, but it is dwarfed by the surrounding neighborhood of hi rise office buildings. Lau Pa Sat is street food heaven, where you can try the chili crabs or the Indian banana pancakes and chase them both down with a cold beer. Plan to stay a long time and come with a group so you can try many things. A real Singaporean dining experience."
,,Nice local food in the CBD,3.0,,"Wide range of food available, our favorite is the Vietnamese stall which is great for soup. You need to have a look around as some of the stalls are average at best. Overall, a good place for a nice and reasonably cheap meal."
,,"Good indoors, great outdoors",4.0,,"Came here on the recommendation of our cabbie after dropping us off at the Merlion. At first the location seemed like any other hawker market only older and more picturesque. It's also situated in the business district so prices are higher than say Maxwell Center.

We tried some steam buns and dim sum from the centre stall and they were delicious, then barbecued stingray and black pepper crab which were also good. There's only one place at the entrance who sell beer to the whole market so look out for the waitresses puttering around in the Tiger beer uniforms.

We then decided to explore a bit (I was on the hunt for noodles) when we realized the satay stalls were all set up lining the building (because of all the smoke from the BBQ grills).

Plenty of people will approach you to try out their stall, we settled on Best Satay 7, they had the most unassuming sales guy and delicious satay. There's no pork but they do duck, chicken, beef, mutton, prawn and babat (intestine).

We tried duck, chicken, mutton and babat and they were all delicious especially the mutton and babat. There are also wandering hawkers selling wet wipes and I recommend buying a pack, they only cost a dollar and come in quite handy after eating satay."
,,Best satay from Best satay stall!,4.0,,"Our daughter who lives in Singapore recommended us to try the satay from stalls 7 and 8, named Best Satay! To start with we had trouble finding them, thinking they were somewhere inside Lau Pa Sat. We then realised the satay stalls were only just heating up their fires to start cooking at about 7pm when the road outside was closed to traffic and tables set up on he road! It was worth waiting for. The satays, especially the prawns, were delicious. We had the set menu of mix of mutton, chicken and prawn satays that came with two sauces, onions and cucumber. Plenty of food for two for £12! Bought cans of beer from the local shop. But one tip. Make sure you take plenty of paper tissues or serviettes with you to wipe your hands. None provided and you will need them! And give the loos a miss!
But great atmosphere and the best hawker court we went to."
,,Great food!,5.0,,"Got here pretty late so there were only a few stalls open. A man offered us a satay platter which consists of chicken, beef & mutton. It was so good! Then we got some fried rice which is also good even by itself. Would love to try other stalls there next time."
,,Heaps of choice,4.0,,"If you are looking for lots of choice at reasonable prices, Lau Pa Sat is for you

We had earmarked a trip to this hawker centre when planning our hols, following internet write ups, and they were pretty much spot on

There is soooo much choice, although most vendors do see chicken rice. I opted for duck noodles, which were great

There's a chance to do some haggling too, but prices are pretty cheap. Lots of drink store to select your favourite juices, again at good prices

Well worth a stop if you're feeling peckish!!"
,,Eat as the locals do,5.0,,"Avoid the overpriced restaurants in the city and eat in Lau Pa Sat instead. It's a busy place but very few foreigners go there to eat (perhaps some expats) though the food is fantastic. Try the carrot cake for a typical Singaporean dish along with some of the delicious peanut sauce dishes from the Malaysian stalls.

I recommend heading there around 11am to get a table before the lunch rush starts, and perhaps 4pm before dinner rush."
,,Good satay but go more for the atmosphere!,4.0,,"I ve been here about 10 times and never fails to impress. The satay street NOT the indoor hawker stalls which look great as well. A steamy night, full of people enjoying good basic food is what you get here. Satay SAtay and satay. You will be approached by vendors spruking for you business but dont worry all are good. Grab a table and order satay sets denoted by quantity and choice. We always have a mix of prawns, mutton & chicken. they come with an individual satay bowl and onion and cucumber, YumYum Yum delicious and cheap. You pay on delivery so if you have a group best have 1 person pay and divide later. Jugs of beer $sg16++ cheap for Singapore! Order sides such as fried rice or baby kai lan in oyster sauce. A cheap fun tasty night mainly full of locals (which is a good recommendation) Its close to the Merlion. Fullerton Bay area."
,,Quaint Old Style,4.0,,Lau Pau Sat is one of the oldest hawker centres around. It does look a bit tired but at least it is unpretentious. There is a good range of food and drink and it has evolved over the years. I first went to LPS in the early 90s!. Also a good satay area on weekend evenings. Lunchtime has the office crowds and night and weekend the ambience changes
,,Gooood food,4.0,,"My kids and I were in the Marina area when we hailed a cab and asked to go to Newton Hawker Center for dinner. Our cab driver advised against it because of the distance and the traffic. He brought us to Lau Pa Sat instead and assured us that the food would be delicious. Good advice.

There is so much choice in this place. We opted for Chicken rice (naturally; it was our first night in Singapore) but we ordered Indian curry, kidney and liver soup and satay too. There's Chinese, Japanese, Western cuisine, Korean, Malaysian, Indonesian, Thai and burgers (Wendy's)! The problem may be too many choices. And all of it smelled so good! It seemed like the food was all home cooking based on the cooks' mothers' recipes.

The original historical structure is there and gives the place its charm. However, I am not giving this hawker center top scores because there is one side of the center that could stand some cleaning. It smelled like dishwater and cooking oil. Ah well. There had to be a stain on an otherwise very positive experience."
,,Just an average food court with poor ventilation,3.0,,I didn't find anything particularly special about this place. Food choices were dismal. Pricing was expensive. Ventilation was poor.
,,Good food lovely building,5.0,,"Set in an old (Scottish) cast iron built market this is a great food court. In fact the only real thing wrong is that it is so good it hard to get a table.

Tip, putting a packet of tissues on a stool while you go and get your food reserves the table for you."
,,Great find!,5.0,,"We visited after our cab driver recommended it - he said ""this is where the normal people eat""! We ended up going twice over our 2 day visit, just because the selection is so good. I had Indian and hubby had Ramen. There are over 100 stalls, with amongst others Indian, Vegetarian Indian, Ramen, other Japanese cuisine, all kinds of Chinese cuisine, Thai, some pub style place on the outside, dessert places and even a Wendy's!

Yes, it's hot - there are fans, no aircon. I guess it gets extremely busy during the week, as it's in the middle of the business district, but we where there on a Friday night and a Saturday afternoon, not busy at all. It's also cheap, for a full Indian meal and a drink, I paid around S$8, if I remember correctly.

Will definitely visit again."
,,Original Victorian structure and great atmosphere,5.0,,"This hawker market was heaving at lunchtime, full of office workers as well as tourists and locals. Huge selection of food, I had chinese and my husband had indian, both good and both really cheap. Would recommend it but probably best to avoid lunchtime, we will be back in the evening to sample the satays that are only sold in the evenings"
,,If you haven't had satay at Lau Pa Sat you have not experienced Singapore,5.0,,"Dn't miss the satay at Lau Pa Sat if you are visiting Singapore! Forget the highly over priced food at Boat Quay and go to this historic preserved beautiful authentic food court to have some satay and a Tiger!
Every evening they will cut off the Boon Tat Street and transfer it into the Satay Street! Our favorite is the stall 7&8! The Tiger selling ladies will walk around to take your orders!
You will also have the napkin selling street vendors - please treat them with respect, they are just trying to earn their living. Pay one dollar or two, and wish them a nice evening!"
,,Authentic experience go for Stall 7/8,4.0,,"This is a down and dirty authentic food experience. I went there on my last night just in case of tummy troubles. Old plastic tables, plastic chairs, plastic plates and plastic cutlery. BUT amazing satays and hardly any tourists. It is filled with Singaporeans. The vendors are pushy so try to get a middle table where you're out of the way of vendors. Do buy a pack of wipes from one of the passing salesman for $1-2 as the satay sticks are greasy. Go to the toilet before you go as the toilets there are revolting. I wouldn't eat anything that wasn't hot just in case."
,,Great Weekday Lunch,5.0,,"We came here around 11AM in the morning expecting to see a ton of activity. We were disappointed because it was fairly empty when we came. Since we were tired and worn out, we decided to that we'd just sit here and eat lunch. During the hour that we decided to sit down and eat, the place literally came alive with activity. Tons of workers from the nearby buildings come here to eat for lunch.

It was also a bonus that all the food we had here was quite delicious!"
,,Satay!!,5.0,,"Fantastic hawker centre in the middle of the street! The Satay was amazing! Beer served at your table too. Great atmosphere and is a MUST do when in Singapore, do go later in the night."
,,Amazing satay! Do not miss!,4.0,,"We visited Lau Pa Sat during a recent brief trip to Singapore and were not disappointed.

It was packed with people enjoying many different types of Asian cuisine. We had a satay set from 'Best Satay' and it was delicious. The tables are set up outside on a closed side street with the satay fires sizzling away nearby. It was a great atmosphere and was definitely one of the best meals we've had in Asia.

Beer is cheap too!"
,,a must eat at place,5.0,,this is in the CBD but is frequented by locals as well as tourists I love the place and go there whenever we can. My husband who works in the cbd eats there almost everyday. u can find a wide selection of food as well as the satays that starts at night .very good prices as well
,,Great Satays!,4.0,,"We were taken here by our Singapore friends. The place doesn't look much but it's a
Singapore institution.
We had beers, fresh juices and fabulous satays all for an amazing cheap price.
It's very casual and relaxing although in the financial business district.

The Satays were the best I've eaten in Singapore, far better than at a five star hotel earlier in the week.

This is an experience and won't cost the earth."
,,A little costly and crowded,3.0,,"a little costly for food court food, but has all the variety... I have tried malay, vietnamese, japanese, Indian (almost all the Indian stalls) and Italian food here... The food is not awesome but you can manage with it if it was not for the cost you pay here for ""food court"" food... but the satay stalls they put up in evening serves some good satay and beer combinations... Should try once if you eat non-veg and visit Singapore..."
,,A bit faded but still charming,4.0,,"Still probably one of the best of the old food centers in Singapore. A bit worn and in need of some refurbishing but has a strange old world charm to the place. Great variety of cuisines from across Asia, good food and cheap prices are perfect for a fun night of food exploration. Tried the dumplings, duck rice and mixed meat and vegetable rice and all of them were good. The satay stalls outside are also great and although a bit more expensive than the main food stall are still affordable. You can get satays brought to a table inside if you want some as a side dish to your main meal as well. And the touts are less aggressive than at Newton Circus. A lot of stalls tend to close early though so make sure to go early to get the best selection of food. Recommended."
,,The best place for satay,5.0,,There are many satay stalls open in the evening after 7pm. The road is closed and tables and stalls are set up. It's the best place in Singapore for an evening of cheap local food in an outdoor environment. There are hidden gems inside the centre. The indian stalls are great value compared to little india's restaurants. There is a variety of food here that would please everybody. It gets busy in the evenings but there are always tables available. There are many satay and seafood touts advertising their business. Ignore them and look around on your own before you choose your food. Outside drinks can also be brought in but the drinks are quite cheap compared to the nearby Clarke and boat quay. It's near raffles place MRT and there are signs to follow from then onwards. A mixed group of customers from business to locals to tourists. There is also a Wendy's hamburger outlet if your kids are not keen on local food.
,,A sample of old Singapore - tastes from all over Asia,4.0,,"My second visit to Lau Pa Sat, went with a local to dinner tonight.

The Indonesian stall took our attention - tried two dishes that I can't remember plus complimentary soup. The dishes and soup were tasty and delicious although a little salty. I think one dish was crisp tofu with fish in a satay sauce.

Washed the meal down with an iced fruit punch like drink - refreshed the mouth immediately.

Then my friend wandered over to the Dessert stall for some Iced Cendol... again to refresh the palate.

While we were eating a band was playing in the background. It was a pleasant catch up with my friend on a warm evening in Singapore."
,,I miss the BBQ prawns and Satay!!!,4.0,,"That's a lot of fresh seafood here and nice local food here,don't worry it won't spent you a lot of $$$,is consider average price here."
,,ordinary,3.0,,This is pretty much the same as any hawker centre. food isnt any better or worse. the touts for satay can be very offensive and over charge. Best go with a local.
,,perfect dinner place,5.0,,"If you want to feel like in the olden times and also have a taste of the incredible Asian kitchen this is the place to be.
Even taking away for a small dinner on the riverfront so that you could see the light show is not such a bad idea as it is very close by."
,,Fantastic Local Food and So Cheap,5.0,,"When in Singapore do yourself a favour and visit Lau Pa Sat for extremely cheap, delicious local food. No frills just honest to goodness great value for money and to top it off within walking distance to Marina Bay to catch the light show and enjoy the atmosphere afterwards. One of the highlights of my trip."
,,Foodie Fun,5.0,,"An incredible variety of everything from buns, to soups, noodles and some of my local favorites like Kway Tow..All at great prices and a very lively , festive environment. Great to go with a group and claim a bunch of tables and order a bunch of dishes. Better yet it is very affordable."
,,Lots of options for different styles of food,3.0,,"We ate here after a long flight from Australia. The best time to go is after 7pm when the satay huts open out on the street. However that is also when you are most likely to have the vendors bothering you!! Lau Pa Sat itself has a large range of different styles of food, and appears to be where the locals eat. The food quality is good, and cheap. It's a good way to experience different foods."
,,Nice range of dishes,4.0,,"Had a nice dinner here - especially a nice satay!
Seems like a good place for a quick meal with friends and a few drinks, although the beer wasn't as cheap as I was expecting.

The best part would definitely be the large range of vendors, so you can choose depending on what you feel like at the time."
,,Do not go to Stand 3/4!!!,1.0,,"In the evening, you can seat outdoor on Boon Tat Stret to eat Satay skewers. Do not go to stand 3/4!!! They cheat you! They tell you that they offer things for free but, when you see the invoice, things are totally different! Avoid!"
,,Choices Galore,5.0,,"The food court is located under a massive historic roof at Raffles Quay. The choice of cheep, great food from all over the world is incredible. My wife and I ate there a couple of times on our recent visit to Singapore and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.

If you want amazing choice, economical price and great food, a visit here will certainly not be wasted.

Great for lunch and dinner."
,,international food stalls,5.0,,its a old british structural centre in the heart of the tall buildings.....where you can drink and dine....match mixing food from different asian countries.....and....by the way...the SATAY over there is famous where they need to close one street every night to accommodate patrons
,,A memorable iconic location but expensive fare!,3.0,,"Brought some overseas visitors to LPS to savour satay and local fare. The location is iconic and beautiful but the food did not give the value-for-money satisfaction! We had satay, mee goreng, kambing soup and a plate of stir-fried vegetables + a jug of beer. The cost - S$70!. We could have gone to a chu-char joint and ate a hearty meal!"
,,A great place for lunch each day,4.0,,"If you are working in the financial centre, there is no place better than Lau Pa Sat at 18 Raffles Quay for a quick bite of lunch each day. One of the oldest historic hawker centres in the city, you can choose from food across all of the Asia Pacific under one roof. Look for the long queue and try a different place each day. Be sure to try the fresh seafood and chicken from the satay stalls on the main street. Don't forget to bring your own napkins."
,,Old-Style Ambiance,4.0,,The building itself speaks of old Singapore...grand and imposing in contrast to the modern high rise surrounding it...the interior setting is even more appealing....a wide array of food stalls and choices...the food impressive and surprisingly cheap....I would surely visit this place the next time I go back to Singapore
,,Historic Hawker Center,4.0,,"Good cheap food! In Singapore, you can get a great authentic asian meal for under $5 USD. And one of the most historic hawker centers in the city is Lau Pa Sat. I eat there at least once a week (my office is a couple blocks away) and I love it every time! In Singapore ""Q-ing"" (standing in line) is a common thing. It probably means that it's popular or a good deal! So find a ""Q"" and experience a great local meal for less than a Starbucks latte! TIP: hawker centers don't provide napkins, so pick up a multi-pack at your local Guardian or Watsons and bring them with you everywhere. Also, to ""hold a table"" leave a few packets on the table. No one will steal them, and it lets people know ""this table is occupied""."
,,Lovely,5.0,,Arrive just before lunch time before the office staff if you can. Have a wander around and then if you see a queue forming - join it. Impossible to spend much and everything is worth trying!
,,Nice building in between Eiffel and gingerbread style,3.0,,"It is a hawker center : the food quality is not the same in every food stall; in general it's really fresh considering the number of customers going through it and I must confess having been impressed by some seafood in the plates of my colleagues. The prices are on the high end for hawker center, around 5 to 6 something dollars and not the 2.50 you can get in some other places; it remains cheap in my opinion and a satisfying quality/freshness price.
I've been there regularly for lunch with colleagues, trying different stalls and mostly some Indonesian barbecue. I will go there again, though I might not choose this as my first choice.
At lunch peak hours, it's really noisy and it can be difficult to find a table.
I know it's supposed to be open 24 hours but have never been outside lunch time."
,,Eating Satay,5.0,,"Delicious food , chilled beer and setting. Full of character and locals eating. Ate at loads of hawker places in our visit to Singapore and KL, going back tonight for more satay. Try the ""chendol"" ice dessert......interesting."
,,With a hint of Covent Garden,3.0,,"When I first saw this building in the 1980s, I was impressed. Very nice. Very colonial. Very tropical. White fret work. Cooling, tall roof.
It reminded me of Covent Garden, slightly. It is a pity there is no opera house nearby. I suppose you could walk a few blocks to either the Esplanade Theaters or the Singapore Chinese Concert Hall, but Lau Pa Sat is here because of food, tourists and nearby office workers on high salaries.
Is the food better than anything else in Singapore? No. Is the experience better? I suppose it depends on what you want. If you want to eat with tourists, fine. If you want real hawker food in a real setting, go elsewhere. But then, if you were a tourist, you probably wouldn’t. For reasons that I partly understand, most westerners take a look at a hawker centre and scream: hygiene, before running back to the Fullerton for high tea. Which is a shame. These places are strictly controlled for hygiene by the NEA so the chances of food poisoning from smelly thumbs in your laksa bowl are rare.
At best, Lau Pa Sat is a hawker centre which has some charm, but if it is a real hawker centre you are after, it is no better, and indeed a lot more expensive, than almost any other hawker centre or coffee shop/ food court in the heartlands where at least you might meet some real locals.
And certainly get equally good, if not better, food."
,,La Pau sat,5.0,,"Diversity of food cultures and tastes on offer, easy relaxed, as cheap or expensive as you want to make it, central location"
,,Satay Street after 7pm - A must try!,5.0,,"Lau Pa Sat is a large Hawker Centre located in the Central Business District. My husband works nearby so its a favourite of ours to stop in after sundown to sit on Satay Street. The road is closed off to traffic from 7pm and by 7.05pm the satay stalls have taken over! Its a really brill experience.

Bear in mind you can sit on any table - don't feel you need to order from whoever may show you to a seat (if at all) but in our experience 'Best Satay' is quite literally, the best! The prawn satay is so good and if you ask them they will de-shell for you, so you don't get too messy!

A good way to try authentic hawker food in a bustling, busy, hot, fun atmosphere. Everyone here always seems to be having a good time!"
,,Too Commercial for As Tourist attraction,3.0,,"I will not recommend my foreign friends to eat at this Hawker. It is too commercial and the price charging is not really cheap. You can get the same quality of food in any shopping center in Singapore.
However, if you would like to try SATAY, no choice you have to come here, no doubt the satay at Lau Pa Sat is a good to try on."
,,surprisingly good quality food,4.0,,"great range of Indian vegetarian / non-veg food, brilliant lunch spot if you work in the Marina Bay area"
,,Very good to place,4.0,,"Lau Pa Sat is a very good hawker center in Singapore. If you are a seafood lover and love the smell of satay then perhaps its the place to be while you are in Singapore. Most of the time the place is crowded and thus you get a very good atmosphere and vibe in there. The food are nice in there just like the atmosphere. While you are in there you should try out the stingray in there as Satay. Overall the place is awesome, just that you may find it hot in there due to all the satay making and other such which generates heat. Expect to be followed by the sales agent of the outlets pressuring you to place order from their outlets"
,,classic food court that's worth a visit,4.0,,"I visited my friend who is from Singapore, and Lau Pa Sat was on her list of food courts to take me to. There are a lot of good food courts in Singapore, but this is a particular favorite of mine. It's not the cleanest or most well organized, but it did feel very authentic to me and not just a gleaming set of stalls like in Takashimaya mall, for instance.

You can see from the pictures here on TripAdvisor that it's a big pavilion filled with local people. It's kind of amazing that such an old, classic food court stood the test of time even thought it's surrounded by huge skyscrapers. It's still around, and for good reason!

There are myriad food choices at Lau Pa Sat and I definitely would recommend a visit to this foodcourt both for his charm and simplicity. It's food at a low cost in a local setting that isn't typical ""moneyed"" Singapore."
,,Great Lunch Venue,5.0,,"Great variety, good mix of crowd and atmosphere was very lively. Lunch time was fun joslting with the cbd crowd but all in the name of finding good local delicacies."
,,Variety of dishes,4.0,,A good place to try many different dishes. The satay are good. A very big hawker centre but can be warm especially in sunny Singapore.
,,Awesome food :P,4.0,,"Must go once, so many varieties of food is there and even veg and non-veg both are available. Few Indian stalls also there for good Indian food, I had nice Indian food in reasonable price. Price also not that much expensive everywhere it's almost same, but must go at least once to see variety of food :)"
,,Ok but would not make a point of returning,3.0,,I swear satay sticks are getting smaller in Singapore. Anyway they were tasty but not great value. Also like everywhere in Asia it seems you'll get pestered everytime you walk past a stall.
,,variety of local food and worldwide,4.0,,"I like the satay, environment but a bit hot. the food price a bit expensive, but you can find really good and creative food.Savour"
,,dont get ripped off,2.0,,you cant get to choose a seat without hawkers bugging you to order from their store. No freedom of choosing and you could get better food elsewhere for a better price.
,,Satay Stick? More like a Satay Trick!,1.0,,"Lau Pa Sat has got to be the WORST hawker centre in Singapore now.

We have been to Singapore on numerous occasions and we have always managed to visit
Lau Pa Sat. Unfortunately, this will no longer happen. As per usual, the customer service is Pitiful and Pathetic, but that is everywhere you go in Singapore (Restaurants, Hotels, Retail stores etc) so we expected that.

Lau Pa Sat is now unhygienic and most importantly the price increase for portion size is outrageous!! The Satay Stick portion size at Lau Pa Sat has reduced drastically!! (It never used to be so small!) At least in Tokyo the Yakitori we had was a decent size along with the BBQ sticks in Manila (Which tasted a lot better too and was packed with chicken)

Bottom Line – Lau Pa Sat has been flushed down the toilet lately.If you are in desperate for a quick feed and willing to pay the extra, then give this place a go (If you do,Please look around and don’t get sucked in by what the locals say!) Otherwise please avoid at all cost and try East Coast or Newton Hawker centre instead."
,,Eat Local and Cheap,4.0,,"All the tastes of Asia in this large out door food court. A great satay vending area with good prices ($4-$6) plus all the local specialties. Eat where the locals eat and enjoy the sights, sounds and aroma."
,,Great gastronomic experience!!!,5.0,,We love food!!!! And we love variety with a great atmosphere! We sat outside in one of the stands where we could identify more locals (this is one of the best tricks for finding good food) Great prawn satays!!!!!
,,Suite every taste bud,4.0,,"We love this hawker. It has many types of cuisine, but we love the fresh satay cooked roadside from 7pm, when they close off the street to traffic. We always take our overseas guest here."
,,SATAY STRIP,4.0,,"Plenty of Satay available, and a food court with hawkers stalls behind for those who dont want satay"
,,"CBD hawker centre by day, Satay st by night",4.0,,"Centrally located and within walking distance of Raffles Place MRT (exit I) is Lau Pa Sat festival pavillion. By day, it is not your typical tourist trap - it is a fully functioning ""food court"" where a good majority of CBD workers are snagging communal seats (with tissue packets), paying with their kopitiam payment card and grabbing their lunch time feed. Popular meals at Lau Pa Sat include Hakka thunder tea rice from a store called 'Thunder tea rice', though it must be an acquired taste as I wasn't a fan (hope you like basil!)

By night, there are sometimes live performances in the centre of the pavilion, but the action is really on the side street adjacent to Lau Pa Sat which turns into ""satay st"". I'd say satay street is must do for a true Singapore dining experience! It is a bit touristy so expect to be 'assisted' to an table by a satay store rep and therefore assumed to order from that store. Given the stores are fairly indistinguishable, I wouldn't get too caught up on it. All stores generally sell satay platters for parties of 2 people and above. Sit back, buy a beer from the designated beer rep (& perhaps a packet of tissues from the old folk who sell them!) and enjoy the satay experience."
,,Worth the visit..,4.0,,"The locals may poo poo the venue...albeit there were certainly plenty of locals the night we went.

Great example of British colonial architecture with an array of outlets whereby no one will not go hungry.
After a flight without touching the fare...the cold jug of tiger beer, pungent, flavoursome satay sauce, rich spicy chilli sauce smothering a crab or two and some wok greens for under $S40 for two can be deemed 'good vale' by this tourist."
,,Satay,4.0,,Have Satay or Skewered Meat BBQ on charcoal and eat them in open ground. Best you compliment with Teh Tarik or silky ceylon tea. Goes well with satay.
,,What's left of the original Singapore,4.0,,"It is amazing to me that there are still places in Singapore that are 'normal', and the way Singapore used to be... In a city/ country where they fine you $900 for smuggling a pack(!) of unopened cigarettes or for eating/drinking on the subway, where you need to spend a minimum of $3000 in some of the night clubs, and where your bill includes a 60 cents fee for using the napkin, it is amazing that you can still find some good, fresh food, authentic atmosphere, vibrant night activities on the blocked street ( blocked for multiple satay vendors) and have some fun for under $100 with your family. I was told that 70% of Singaporeans don't cook at home, this place ( and all the other hawker centres) might be the reason."
,,Classic,4.0,,"Singapores oldest food court offers you a wide range of loca and SEA kitchen food. Try to be carefull and avoid the seafood scammers, than its an enjoyable place."
,,Locals don't like Lau Pa Sat,2.0,,"Most locally born Singaporeans don't fancy Lau Pa Sat for many reasons. Most of them are just average in taste yet pricey. Some of them even tout, which is just not acceptable for the locals.

For visiting tourists, if you have some time to venture a little and like to try what some locals get for their dinner daily, do try ""heartland"" favorites like Kovan 209 Market & Food Centre (MRT: Kovan ) or Chong Pang Hawker Center (MRT: Yishun/Sembawang + bus). Old Airport Road Food Centre (MRT: Dakota/Mountbattan) is many locals' favourites. Look out for stalls with awards, culinary certificates or photos with local celebrities and join the queues! It shouldn't go too far from wrong! :D"
,,Average Satay - Reasonable Hawker Prices,3.0,,"Lau Pa Sat really has turned into a tourist trap. The reality is that the satay is barely average, and prices at other stalls are higher than what they should be (regardless of the fact that this is located in the CBD). Expect that satay vendors will be heckling you constantly (a more gentle Singaporean heckling), and don't feel the need to order from them.

If you are in the indoors area, you can sit at any table and order from any stall. Although someone may leave a menu in front of you, it does not mean that you need to order from that menu to sit there... these are not full service restaurants.

My recommendation is to go to another hawker market (Newton, Chinatown-Maxwell, even the one at Esplanade) if you want good food (there are exceptions, where you can actually find good food at Lau Pa Sat, see other posts)"
,,Tourist trap!,2.0,,"Dine here at your own risk. Ambience at this place over 10 years was vibrant, full of local flavour. Perhaps that's why it managed to build a reputation. Now, it's just a tourist trap based on its past reputation. Exhorbitant prices for local fare."
,,cheap place to eat,4.0,,"Satay, satay, chicken rice, satay! good place to find relatively cheap but good food. There are many food stalls that offer different cuisines.

i like the structure of the building! they said it used to be a wet market.

its located in the middle of the city's business district so expect to see office workers eating here during lunch time.

i prefer going here at night for beer and more satay with friends!"
,,Think of a dish and you'll get there,4.0,,"It is an amazing place, there are around 114 stalls and you will find different kinds of cuisines, Korean, Italian, Indian and the list goes on... Great place to visit with Friends, avoid lunch time from 12-2pm as it is very crowded, during evenings there are Satay stalls, great idea to grab a beer and enjoy sizzling Satay."
,,A great hawker centre with character,4.0,,After a long days travel we decided to go local and inexpensive on our first night. The place is amazing with so many outlets to choose from. Had some famous chicken rice and other dishes at a cost of a few dollars. More character than maxwell road food centre
,,"Historical building, ordinary food",3.0,,"A nice, cheap place to meet friends for satay and a beer but the quality of the food stalls aren't so good, I prefer Maxwell Food Centre. The building is lovely, it used to be a market. Satay and beer is about $9 per person."
,,A Wasted Venue,2.0,,"Firstly! let me say that the suburbon Hawker centres or food courts are by far better in cleanlyness and professionalism and a far better place for a local expieriance.Lau Pa Sat is the most over rated attraction in Singapore by a hundred mile and an absolute shame as it is a lovely old grand pavillion.If any tourists or locals want to eat or even just visit there on a Sunday afternoon or in the evening the place is only a quarter functioning at most and the rest is in a shocking state from the night before.Dont bother as you cant see what you are eating on a dark night on the street and if you need convincing get there on a Sunday afternoon to see the food preperation areas and the filth being hosed into corners ,you,ll never go back.I gave it a 2 because of its archatecture and nothing else."
,,Victorian architecture and authentic food,4.0,,"Braving a tropical downpour we achieved our destination only to find that 3pm on a Sunday was a pretty quiet time in Lau Pa Sat and many of the stalls were closed. That said, we were able to wander around, make our choice, and find a seat without any trouble."
,,Great Satays!,5.0,,"I live in SG but I always to our family and friends from home to have a large serving of satays at a great price, and my husband loves to add a little history to the trip too!"
,,Hawker Food in Victorian Splendor!,5.0,,"Everyone hears about hawker food in Sing. If you want the real thing with a modicum of Health Dept oversight go to Lau Pa Sat, a cast iron Victorian relic near Chinatown that contains at least four dozen different food stalls cooking made-to-order Asian food. My wife enjoyed a Korean fish stew and I had a tasty Indian fish curry. We could have eaten sushi, dim sum, Szechuan, a wide variety of Indian and local foods. It is always crowded, smells wonderful and is a sight in itself. It was raining when we visited but that did not dampen appetites or enthusiasm. This a a must stop!"
,,Dissapointing,2.0,,I grew up in Singapore...Lau Pa Sat used to be a nice place to go to eat for various Asian dishes at local prices. Nowadays its like they ambush you the moment you step into that place and shove their menus in your face so you eat at their stalls. Once you done ordering and receive your food...they are not interested in you anymore. They don't even look friendly before and after ordering food. There's so many other places with much better service....food court types. Foreigners might not know the difference...but the locals do.
,,Enjoyed the meal and cold beer,4.0,,"Had a nice meal with Singaporean work friends. They did the ordering and we had meals coming to our table from all directions. We had satay sticks,black pepper beef , a great spicy coated stingray flap and a tasty noodle dish. Happy hour jugs of tiger were $16 and we had a nice evening."
,,Vibrant atmosphere + awesome food = Great birthday gathering!,5.0,,"Absolutely LOVED the vibrant atmosphere of Lau Pa Sat, providing a large variety of food selections from different Asian culinary styles, and everything that we had were excellently prepared at budget prices! We planned a birthday celebration at Lau Pa Sat, and it was a surprisingly awesome experience: we got Indian food, Shanghai-style pork buns / noodles, Vietnamese food and Malay-style Nasi Lemak, everything were cooked to impress. Our gathering ended up costing less than $50 for 10 people, not bad at all! Definitely would recommend Lau Pa Sat to anyone looking for good food at a clean and authentic Singaporean hawker centre bearing an indescribable character and charm!"
,,Still one of the best.,4.0,,"This place is an institution in Singapore. We have visited many times over many years and always look forward to going back. No matter what you feel like on any particular day, there is something there for everyone. Served with old fashioned service, care and a smile, if you're out and about this is the place to stop for a feed."
,,A little disappointing,3.0,,"I don't know whether it was because it was a Sunday, or because it was the middle of the day, but half the stalls were closed so choice was a little restricted. What I did manage to get was perfectly edible though - Char Kway Teow and Kopi with Kaya Toast."
,,food yummy...,4.0,,"wanna try some local satay..the steet is blocked by the vendors and you have smokey saty tempting your palate...so grab some(meat),..."
,,good atmosphere and nice food,5.0,,"the satay there is a must try! overall the food there is nice and there are different bands performing every night. though the food there is nice but price wise, is more expensive.
and is located in the town after dinner or supper you can go down to clarke quay to visit pubs or clubs or take a stroll along singapore river"
,,A street night market for Satay,4.0,,At about 7pm this short street is closed and folding tables and chairs are set out and satay stalls open along with drinks stalls and other local food from the adjacent hawker food market. This is the most popular location in Singapore for Satay and it is well worth a visit. Beware of the rather frenzied attempts to serve by the various waiters trying to get your business as you enter the street and try to decide on which of the many stalls to buy from. There is also competition from the ladies selling beer so just slow things down before deciding what to eat and drink.
,,So much fun!,5.0,,"We loved this hawker center! Exactly what we were looking for! Great atmosphere, right in the middle of everything! Awesome food & beer! Sit in the street where the sate grills are! Awesome experience!"
,,Great variety,4.0,,"This is worth the visit! A real taste of Singapore if you ask me. I thoroughly enjoyed the part where I could not make up my mind and had a hard time choosing what food to eat, the stall and food choices were immense. I ended up buying a bit of everything. The satay was just perfect."
,,The place where only tourist goes.,2.0,,"Quite curious on how the people rated this kinda rating.

Just a Guide for tourists.

Singapore food isn't about Lau pa sat (old market in mandrain) and Newton food centre. If you ever wonder then why people always recommended you guys to go there. It's only because they right in city and wide varities combination at 1 location. The price is expensive. The quality is ok only. the annoy people that keep asking you to order and rushed over to the table you are walking towards.

It used to be very nice. but that was like 12-14yrs ago.
Personally will recomend you guys to amoy food centre and china town market if you really want good food near the town. If you really really want fantestic local food. Then you have to search for them 1 by 1 at different location.

Best will be searching trough internet protal like ieatishootipost.sg/ or www.hungrygowhere.com/ for good food"
,,Great Variety,5.0,,"Was at Lau Pa Sat quite late, nearly 12am. Can see that many stalls are there but only couple are left open. Tried out the Fried Carrot cake, Fried Kway Teow & Satays. Satay was really awesome and delicious.

Overall, a nice place and gives you a wide variety of food. A very famous place to dine at, even tourists from all over had heard of this place and tend to visit it. Cheap / Reasonable local delicacies can be found at La Pa Sat."
,,Not the best food but a great choice and atmosphere,4.0,,"OK so the below few reviewers would rather send you to any other hawker centre but Lau Pa Sat. I dare to disagree with them. Here's my 2 cents:

- OK so the food is not consistently as good as some other hawker centres. However, there are loads and loads of stalls, and I've had some pretty decent food there as well. And let's face it, you don't go to a hawker centre for haute cuisine...
- As for location, this is by far the most interesting to be. It's right in the CBD, looks good, enjoyable cheesy entertainment some nights - so much easier to get to and more entertaining than say Old Airport Rd. For tourists, unless serious foodies I wouldn't even want to send them far out of town for their S$5 meal.

What would I recommend? As an ex-local, I would probably tell people to go here especially if they're just stopping over in Singapore. The building and atmosphere is worth it, and whenever I've been there with friends it's been great. If you're in Singapore longer and want to sample loads of hawker food, then still make a stop here but be sure to try several hawker centres to ensure you've had the full Singaporean food-on-a-budget experience!"
,,It was ok - worth a try,3.0,,We had gone to Newton Hawker Centre the night before and wanted to try somewhere else so decided to go to Lau Pa Sat. It was a very different vibe to Newton. The food variety there was ok - I felt it was a bit lacking after visiting Newton. The taste itself wasn't bad but it wasn't something to write home about. I don't know if I would visit again. The prices were very good though.
,,Idea location to try a variety of Singapore food,4.0,,"A unique setting, a variety of Singapore food, affordable prices (not the cheapest) in a non-airconditioned setting. Whether it is char-kway teow, carrot cake, rojak, satay, nasi lemak, mee goreng or pratas that you seek, you will find them all here. This is a much better location to patronise than the food-court at Newton where there are many reports of tourists being fleeced (especially when they order seafood)."
,,Nice place,4.0,,Worth a visit! We had lunch and chose Indonesian food which was very tasty. The pavilion is nice and a good place to have a break. But it was very surprising that they wanted to charge us 30 cents for paper napkins!?
,,The best food court!,5.0,,"Located in an elaborate Victorian worked metal building, this food court in the business district has all the favourite stalls, but in the evenings, a whole row of satay stalls are set up and the air is filled with roasting meat smells - yum! Enjoy satay, sugar cane juice, char kway teoh, charcoal grilled skate wing, etc etc....not to be missed!"
,,Wide array of food,3.0,,"Wide array of food, but overpriced. But it's a good congregation of the entire spread of Singaporean fare"
,,Satay oh satay............,2.0,,"Eversince Satay club closed down near the City Hall, I only go to Lau Pa Sat for the satay. They´ve set up for many years now the satay street of Singapore. I find it everage bacause, the satay there are all the same. There´s not much variety in taste. It seems like all of them buy from the same suppler. People trying to grab you to buy from thier stall, slow service, loud and rude waiters are some of the things that I hate going there. I just hope that there,s a bit of order in that street will do us all good!"
,,Can try,3.0,,Odd to travel to a business district for makan. seems to cater more to the working crowd although the food is worth trying.
,,"Atmosphere, good food, great experience",5.0,,"Took some french friends here...far from michelin star and they loved it. Grab some chairs and a table and wait for the menus to arrive. satays are great and choices of prawn, lamb, chicken. other sellers can bring rotis and rice. jugs of beer are also available. A must experience in singapore."
,,Interesting place to get some lunch,4.0,,"Overall: yes. Lau Pa Sat is an interesting thing to experience for some lunch. The food is good, cheap, and it shows you a different side of Singapore that is worth getting to know a little about.

Quick note: I would disagree at the reviewers calling it ""touristy"" because when I was there at 12:30pm on a Monday, it was filled with office workers (unless all tourists in Singapore dress up in business attire). Getting a seat can be hard during the lunch rush but at about 1:15pm the place emptied out as people went back to work.

It's cheap -- noodles for S$4. I don't see how that is overpriced. 7-11 has a bag of chips for about $1 if you want to save money....

Recommendation: Bring napkins or tissues because most places don't have them. Drink bar is in the center and they have Tiger Beer :)

Yes, the toilet is dirty and if that is offensive, then perhaps staying in your hotel is a better idea."
,,Must try!,5.0,,Satay along the streets at night is a good for tourists. one of the best satay i've tasted not to mention the cheapest too!
,,Great for lunch,5.0,,We like to visit for lunch .... before the office crowds. Pick stalls with queues and we found our best curries here. Evenings produce great satays in Satay Street!
,,so much choice,4.0,,"there was an almost overwhelming amount of choice here - koren, indian, thai, chinese.... we ate here twice, once arounf 8pm and once around 5pm - later was busy and bussling but a few people hassling with menus - earlier it was very quiet but lacked the atmosphere of later. The beer here was the cheapest i found in singapore. The food is good although i suspect differnt quality from different stalls the food we had both times was good (from 2 different stalls) although no better than the food at most food halls across singapore. cheap $4-$10 per meal. tkae wet-wipes as napkins are not avalable unless you pay. By Singapore standards its not quiet as clean as many places but Singapore is the queen of clean."
,,CBD's hunger port,3.0,,Thousands of people flock to Lau Pa Sat daily during the lunchtime race and so they forget to enjoy their meals and so much that the hawkers have learnt to forget tasting the food they sold.
,,"Excellent food at low prices, try satay !",4.0,,"An excellent place to try different South Asia cuisines, but also Indian, Japanese, Correan, etc. The choice is really wide, and the prices very low which makes this place very popular among both tourists and locals so you can expect crowds at some parts of the day. The tables are not at the highest hygiene standards so be prepare for it (this is a hawker centre!), but the food is very tasty and it is difficult to resist and try as much as possible. On top, there is – in the evening – part of the market with satay of all kinds, at 60c per stick: chicken, beef, mutton, prawns, and they are really delicious. Mug of beer and 10 sticks are really recommended. The centre is well located and easy to find, very close to the river and bay, not more than 10 minutes walk."
,,Great little hawker centre!,4.0,,"I went here specifically as it was advertised as one of the great tourist places to go to in Singapore and I was not disappointed. There was an abundance of stands around the pavilion, serving both traditional and other culture foods. Along the back, at night, are the satay stands and you should definitely try it!

Some people may find it intimidating with so many people asking if you want to buy from their store, but I found it part of the charm."
,,Awesome place with good food.,5.0,,Nice ambience at night for the night revellers looking for a good fare of asian food. A lil bit pricey and please avoid it on weekday lunch time due to the crowd.
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,Well worth a visit. Cheap and delicious meals. Average prices seemed to be around $4 SGD. We had lunch there and we are pleased we went. Ask around if your not sure of what to eat. Lots of variety. It was very good indeed.
,,The best hawker center by the Marina,5.0,,"A good number of stalls with a variety of food. We were never disappointed! Great value. There are also an entire row of satay hawkers on the south side. Look for the stalls with the grizzled veteran working the grill, using all the tools including the fan. Nice layout of the pavilion especially when they have live music."
,,Lots of choice,5.0,,"Great atmosphere, food was fresh and quick. BYO available. The staff were helpful and informative. ATMs on site. Good toilet facilities. Easy to access by MRT, taxi and bus."
,,Huge variety of hawker food amid faded victorian architecture,4.0,,"This faded beauty of a building houses a large range of stalls featuring food from different regions and countries. It is all a bit grubby and tired, but we found the food to be really good value and extremely tasty on both occasions that we visited. Unlike other people, we weren't hassled by the hawkers (unlike at Newton Circus where we found the vendors to be extremely pushy, and the selection not as good). Enjoyed both our visits here, and only wished we had more time in Singapore to try all the different foods on offer."
,,Reasonable price for inner eateries but beware of outer eateries near Lau Pa Sat,4.0,,"It is a nice spot to check out for cheap foodies and leisure area. Its architecture is also very attractive, it worths foto section apart from foodies

I had tried a chili crab from one of the eateries here, costs SGD 25 only! Very tasty and juicy ^-^ simply like it!

One information I would like to give tourists that the eateries inside Lau Pa Sat are reliable (not cheating you for the price since they are also written on board), Beware some random people come to you nicely and ask you to go out/ near Lau Pa Sat for trying their satay sticks. You look up their menu seems cheap, but when you sit down and start to order, they force you to order a quantity and choices, turn out could be very expensive!"
,,"You have to try the food here, but there are a lot of dirty tables",3.0,,"It's like a huge food court with hawkers on sidestreets at night. Don't expect a clean food court though.
You have to try the chili crab, stingray, and the hawkers selling ""barbecue"" on the sidestreet.
Food here is cheap, and some dishes come in big portions so you can share (like the chili crab and stingray).
Quite a long walk from the train station, but is worth a try. Just prepare yourself for the dirty tables and plastic chairs and tables."
,,come here for evening satay - street becomes satay vendors.,5.0,,"Young grandsons love to come here for satay in the early evening. Stall 8 has terrific satay - chicken, lamb and beef. Last time we tried the shrimp, it was excellent as well. Between 2 kids and 3 adults there were 93 ""empty sticks"" from satay!"
,,Good experience,4.0,,"Open air eating. Road closed at night for satay stalls. You will feel pressured to buy as soon as you walk into the night satay market. If you can handle this until you order, then it is a good night out. Beers are $4,40 for a mug. Satays are 60c from every stall. Rice and noodles can be added. Cheaper meals inside but not a satay market."
,,So much choice,4.0,,"So much choice! The must be close to 150 stalls here serving every type of cuisine you can imagine, all in a really nice Victorian building. Difficult to recommend any one stall, but I would recommend going as a big group and ordering things from lots of different places. On an evening the close the street behind, and bbq stalls are set up (good satay!).

Prices are almost unbelievably cheap: SGD5.50 for chicken tikka curry, rice, naan, sauce, vegetables. SGD 9 for 15 skewers of beef, duck, chicken satay. Beer is SGD 4.40 for a glass, SGD 3.70 for a can.

The process for ordering and seating can be a little overwhelming for the initiated, but you can't really go wrong!"
,,Lots of variety of food,3.0,,"Lau Pa Sat is a very nice place to experience the different cuisines of Singapore. Bang in the heart of the Singapore Business district, its has a good old market charm to it.

At night the road besides this market is closed to vehicular traffic and converts itself to a open air cafe.
Good eatery!"
,,Dinner on the street,4.0,,"They set up tables at night time, we ordered BBQ set with lamb, beef, chicken and prawn. Taste right but price a bit high."
,,Beautiful hawker centre,4.0,,The food in Lau Pa Sat is like in most hawker centres good and the variety is breathtaking. What sets this one apart is the design. As it is in the CBD it gets very busy at lunch time. Have a look at the ceiling and enjoy the victorian iron works.
,,Great for a late night meal,3.0,,"Prices of food here are not as expensive as one would think. Almost comparable to most food courts now. More than ample seats around. There are several seafood and satay stalls in the food centre. Choose wisely and do not be pressured to order from the first hawker that comes up to you with his menu. Chances are, they are the poorer (business wise) ones."
,,Good eat!,4.0,,"The whole family enjoyed our very late dinner here at Lau Pa Sat! However, while on a taxi.. The taxi driver warned us to order directly from the restaurant stalls not from boys calling for you to order from them to save money. Satay and the stingray were really good! Sugarcane juice was also good!"
,,My favourite Hawker Centre!!!,4.0,,"The best Hawker Centre in Singapore, right in the middle of the city inbetween all the highrise. The road is blocked at night and all tables and stands are put on the street. Many stand owners will come by to offer you food and drinks. While enjoying the food, the sky scrapers makes the setting intriguing. Don't forget the satey...they're the best and it's very easy to overorder."
,,Top Notch!,5.0,,"This place is up there with the Maxwell Food Centre. There is a huge amount of choice with pretty much everyting being in the 4 to 7 dollar region. The new hygiene rating system in Singapore is in evidence, and saw nothing lower than a 'B' rating, which was fine by me."
,,"Good food,",4.0,,"Food available early but suggest you dont go until 7pm and atmosphere kicking in when Boon tat? street becomes ladden with tables
walk to merlion and back afterwards - took an hour and worth seeing the lights and marina bay sands etc
Nothing will ever be as good as the old satay markets from last century but enjoyed the sting ray dish and prawn satay this time"
,,Sizzling satay sticks in the open air!,5.0,,"Just got home from dinner here and enjoyed the experience! I suggest arrive about 6.30pm to check out the stalls then hang around the satay stands (on the street outside) until they set up the tables in the street from 7pm. Then grab a table, order many satays and cold beer (you pay cash when they bring the food to your table) and enjoy the very fresh satay, spicy sauce and atmosphere thick with smoke, sizzle and people watching in the open air (instead of some centres where it can feel stuffy and hot under the roof). Many stalls have sales people waving menus but don't feel obliged. Also tried the bbq stingray with a spicy sauce, yum!

Toilets were standard for this type of centre in Singapore."
,,Satay!!,3.0,,"Tasty satay and BBQ seafood choices like sting ray, squid, prawns. Airy place amongst the tall mixed of modern and old architectures in shenton way. Located just at the gateway to Marina Bay Sands. Great place to be in after a walk during the weekends down Singapore Financial District!"
,,A feast for all the senses,4.0,,"My 2 boys, 10 and 14 and my husband and I had dinner at Lau Pa Sat. The taxi dropped us off and we walked into the amazing wrought iron painted white building. Only half of the stalls were opened and i was curious to where everybody was as I had heard it was one of the best. Then we walked through to the other side and the place was alive with people, food, Tiger beer on tap and best of all sates cooking on coals. We found a table and ordered a selection of sates, an oyster omlete, fried chicken and roti and baby clams with dipping sauces. We ordered a jug of cold tiger beer and 2 glasses of lime and sugar cane drinks. The atmosphere and food were amazing, the smell of the sates cooking and the slight smokey haze let us know that we were in Singapore."
,,EXpensive tasteless food,1.0,,"The place definitely needs a very thorough cleaning. I wouldn't be surprised if the place is infested with cockroaches and rats. There were a few stalls which got bugs crawling all over the 'supposedly' clean plates. The place is often very hot during summer, outdoor seating are prone to bird droppings. I have never went there again. There's seriously some hygiene issues over there. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone to go there."
,,"Worth a visit, especially for guests",4.0,,"Ok, so LPS is a bit more expensive and a bit of a tourist attraction, nevertheless the food is pretty good and the setting more interesting than most food courts. The won tan was good and the chicken rice tasty. Get there a little early (11:30) to avoid the business workers lunch rush and you'll have no problem finding a table. Due to the size of the place, tables are round with stools, which also is much nicer than the refectory Formica standard tables in other food courts. Definitely worth a visit and your guests will enjoy. If you are driving into the CBD there is parking on Telegraph Street 6th floor, although $5 per hour is a tad expensive. Go and enjoy"
,,Food quality not fantastic,3.0,,"i was bringing guests in town to experience the local street food, great ambience but for better quality food, i would have gone to newton. the touting was quite irritating as well."
,,This place level of standard has dropped...,3.0,,"Be it the food or the ambience, the level has dropped compared to eating here years ago. The satays were almost the same for every stall and the foods standard were not as delicious as before."
,,Pretty expensive hawker,3.0,,"I thought it would be very cheap like $2 or so but nope, most items are food court prices such as $4 and above. Lots of choices of hawker eats but nothing too great to my liking that would get me coming again and again. Will only pop by if in the vicinity and need food to fill the stomach. Usually hot weather in the afternoon."
,,Satay Satay satay,4.0,,"Surprised the place isn't busier being so central, but I guess at night the biz district clears out. All the better to chill at then... if it's not raining head outside and load up on the stay...abd Tiger"
,,Varities...,3.0,,There are plenty choices of food.Its from Local to International range. At night its a satay parlour....must try the prawn and cuttlefish satay coupled with the sugarcane with lime. Its one stop hawker or food court enviroment.
,,Affordable and More Choice,5.0,,"My wife loves to eat. When we were going to Singapore, we made a plan to visit this place. This place looks so well maintained. The ornament looks classic. There are a lot of choice of foods and beverages with affordable prices. Next time, if we go to Singapore, we will not forget to visit this place."
,,Spoiled for Choice,5.0,,"Lau Pa Sat offers a variety unmatched without bursting the bank.All the Asian delicacies can be found at one place,it is in the heart of the CBD and near the new Marina Bay district.Well connected by public transport."
,,Crabs and more,4.0,,We usually go here for the crab dishes. have visited twice and liked the experience. they have a variety of other foods as there are all kinds of stalls there!
,,Good variety and price,4.0,,A good foodcourt in the CBD. There's a huge variety of options available and the prices are good. Worth a visit.
,,Disappointing - maybe the wrong time ?,3.0,,"We were there on sunday evening to get some local food. Additionally to every written guide our host recommended to go to a hawj#ker center, maybe not this one or oat another time....

In the Festival Market approx. one third of the stalls were closed and the others had more or less the same offer...
Outside were a lot of bbq with satay and that was a little crowded. Although there enough seats avalaible the table brokers tried to do there job...

At least we were a little bit disappointed, on our way back we recognized arounf mosque street severa nice looking restaurants with different dishes."
,,Good for first-timers,4.0,,"Lau Pa Sat is a massive hawker center conveniently located near the Fullerton Hotel. The locals will tell you to avoid it because it's for tourists...ignore them. And let's face it, if you're reading this you probably are a tourist so enjoy it.

It's a great mix of all kinds of foods (and many locals), and plenty of them. And cheap too! For about $10US you could try 3 different stands. And it's open 24 hours- bonus!

I've been going there for 10 years, and I'll still go- tourist or not!"
,,Best satay sticks,4.0,,"We have visited few times and the satay sticks despite not being the cheapest are great. There is other food available of course, the juices are freshly squeezed in front of you and very cheap."
,,eat till you pop lah,4.0,,so many different dishes something for every taste bud...10 of us over indulged in far too many dishes
,,"Great food, but clean tables are hard to find",3.0,,"Some really tasty food here, at very low prices, esp considering the location so close to the city centre. Lots of office workers buy meals as takeaway, so the food must be good.
But the cleaners are a big letdown. Tables once used simply don't get cleaned for ages.
We often eat a meal without seeing a sign of a cleaner, dirty tables are left untouched.
When I last visited March 2011 I gave up eating here, it was hopeless finding a clean table in the evening. Perhaps it's less popular now, but we can find enough unused tables to eat here, and do so regularly. Despite the messy tables, I've seen no signs of flies or any other issues, so still use it.
Unless you like smoke, don't eat near the satay stalls! Also the singers are so over-amplified that it's difficult to shout over them near the stage.
If it wasn't so convenient and cheap for the city (and the food is excellent) I'd avoid it, but it is a nice place despite its problems. I've been coming here for 20 years, and I'm sad to see it going downhill."
,,great range of foods,4.0,,"fantastic value for money, good atmosphere, very busy at lunch. What bit of the animal wont you find cooked here!"
,,Satay Number 8!,4.0,,"If you go to Boon Tat Street in the evening for Satay then Satay No. 8 is the best of them all! The best satay in town.
If you prefer Dim Sum then go to the middle of Lau Pa Sat to the 24 hour Dim sum stall - yum!"
,,Great place,5.0,,"Lots of great selections, just a nice, chill place to eat and hang out. Loved the cereal prawns and satay."
,,Good Eating Venue Downtown...,4.0,,"Ate here with the family on our two-night Singapore stop over en route to Oz.
This was the last of three hawker centrea that we tried. Very large eating space packed with tables. As ever, a bewildering choice of various foods to try. We showed p around noon and the place was buzzing with local workers having a (very) quick lunch. Good food, maybe not the best centre we ate at but still pretty good."
,,Good food in 'old Singapore' setting,5.0,,"Went at lunchtime and wished that we had the chance to go more times. Beautiful old cast-iron circular market, lots of seating and small stalls selling a huge variety of food and drinks. Sit at tables on small stools under the ceiling fans and just grab whatever you fancy from any of the stalls. Clean, interesting, a great spot to eat and people-watch."
,,"Good food, great experience",5.0,,"The beautiful intricate ironwork in the historic market make a great setting for Singapore hawker fare. It sits like an oasis in the middle of the bustling financial district. Well frequented by visitors and locals alike, and a welcome change from the high-tech, high-priced glitz of the nearby Sands complex."
,,Satay Station,3.0,,Lau Pa Sat is more about the experience of being surrounded by Satay vendors in the middle of the Financial district than it is about the food. Satay is good but nothing I would go out of the way for.
,,Okay..,3.0,,The food wasn't as nice as the last time I went.Maybe it wasn't my day when I went there haha.Like the satay I had was dry.
,,Good selection of food,3.0,,This is a hawker centre housed in a historic victorian style iron structure. It offers great selection of local food and it gets really crowded during lunch time on weekdays.
,,Touted as Iconic and historical market of old.,3.0,,Chasing for more visitors has taken away it old charm. She will no longer be a showcase but just another city eating place.
,,Busy as usual,4.0,,"The food here is great, and you choose whatever you like from one of dozens of stalls. It's ideal for trying small helpings of different styles of food, or having a banquet from a single stall if you prefer.

Everything is here, Chinese, Malay, Indian, Italian (eh?) anything you might wish for, and reasonably priced beer if you cant go without, yes, I can't.

Situated in the old iron Victorian market building Lau Pa Sat seems to have moved location over the years, but is as busy as ever, with the long lunch-time queues quickly served. It does get crowded, but the food is worth the search for a table, and the subsequent delicious food.

There's nothing to dislike here, though if you prefer a gentle restuarant atmosphere the bustle of Lau Pa Sat might not be for you - if in doubt, have a walk through before you decide - you might not be able to resist the food."
,,Foodtripping at Lau Pa Sat,4.0,,"Hungry? Nevermind the outdoors feel, and the grill-smokey atmosphere? Head to Lau Pa Sat!

Taxi drivers know where it is. It's a -10min cab ride from MBS area and it's cheaper than Makhan Sutra, another famous hawker place nearby.

Old world structure with hawker booths both indoors and out. The almost-elderly vendors in some stalls gives you the assurance that comes with age and expertise, giving your meal a well-rounded taste.

4 of us shared a meal from a stall by the edge if the elevated area near the corner of Boontat and Raffles Quay. Black pepper crab, Chili pepper crab, Cereal prawns, Rice good for all... for just SGD90! What a deal! Water bowl w/ calamansi is provided for finger washing dip. But still, better to bring wet tissues.

Bottled H20 and other drinks like Milo dinosaur, fruit juices, soda, are available at another stall. Satay area is down along Boontat street - yes, it's closed to traffic at night just for the hawkers.

Prepare for the meal, go there hungry!"
,,Hawker center at its best,5.0,,"Busy, crowded and genuine hawker center in the middle of skyscrapers, near Marina Bay. Old, nice building dating back 1894 (winner of the top ten best family experiences 2006 in Singapore). Delicious and very affordable, great variety of different kitchens. Live music most of the evenings between 8-10 pm. Dinner for two plus soft drinks all together 15 SGD."
,,Lotsa choices!,4.0,,"So many options for noodles, seafood, etc with very reasonable prices and there's even a Tapa King for Filipinos like me looking for a taste of home. Located in the beating heart of Singapore's CBD"
,,Food,3.0,,"Lau pa sat (english=old market) is an old building with the interesting history. Normally I only come to this place in the evening (after 7) for their satay. I don't think local Singaporean will intentionally come to eat here (except for night satay, seafood) unless they work nearby. I went there couple times and tried the local food such as Laksa and other food (noodle, etc) and the taste was different. The laksa was diluted and when i asked the stall assistant, he said the taste was like that. If you wanna try the local food, better try it at novena food market or other foodcourts/kopitiam."
,,Great Hawker Food,4.0,,"We first visited Lau Pa Sat some two years ago when passing through Singapore. At the time we were impressed with the beautiful wrought iron structure: a relic of a Singapore long gone, but even more impressed by the vast array of local ""street"" food on offer. Since then we've made a point of eating there at least once whenever we happen to be in Singapore.

Lau Pa Sat is housed in a distinctive octagonal 19th century building not far from Singapore's business district, and a short walk from Raffles Place MRT station. A lunch time is is jam packed with workers from nearby high-rise buildings, but wait until about 1:30PM and the place becomes a bit less crowded. After about 5PM an adjoining street is closed of and becomes a pedestrian area selling various types of satay.

We had one night in Singapore en route to London, and decided to pop in for dinner. Unfortunately it was a Sunday night and a lot of the stalls weren't open. But we still managed an entree of satay outside, and found enough to eat inside the building. On our return we had a full 4 days, so could time our visit a bit better. We arrived for lunch at the tail end of the crowd and waited a short time so we could get a table with a breeze near one of the entrances. I probably should mention that for those not used to the heat and high humidity of Singapore it can get pretty uncomfortable deep inside the building. Lunch was good and cheap.

A night or so later we came back for dinner, this time the full menu of satay from stalls 7 & 8 that so many here recommend. Not so cheap this time, but there was more beef, chicken and prawn sticks than we could comfortably eat. and they were delicious.

It's hard to say for sure, but in my personal opinion the food quality inside may have dropped a bit since our first visits. This is a very subjective judgement based on hazy memories, and obviously our choices of stalls and meals comes into play too, but I seem to recall it being a bit better than our last visit. There's certainly better food to be had in Singapore, but at vastly inflated prices compared to places like Newton circus and Lau Pa Sat.

And yes! Next time we find ourselves in Singapore we'll be sure to fit in a meal here again."
,,Best Satay Lau Pa Sat,4.0,,"Just to correct a previous review, I went to lau pa sat myself yesterday and I found out that Stall 7 and 9 are NOT the same owner. Stall 7 & 8 are the same owner. Stall 9 has a different owner. But you're right, stall 7 & 8 have got some really good satay. Thanks!"
,,Good quality 'hawker' food,5.0,,"Great experience...fantastic range to choose from, excellent value, good quality. If you go after 7pm the satay stalls are open in the street...street cooking at it's best."
,,Great hawkers food,5.0,,"The Lau Pa Sat Pavillion is located in the financial district of Singapore (get off MRT at Raffles Place and then head down Raffles Quay). It is a great hawker centre with a huge array of local delicacies and traditional hawker foods.

Don't expect a fancy dining experience, but do expect freshly made, tasty Asian and Indian cuisine. A great meal can be had for as little as S$4. The building itself is all Victorian iron work, but it isn't air conditioned so it can be a bit warm.

If you are looking for real Singaporean dining experience look no further."
,,Good Satay,3.0,,"It has food of various authenticity, local, chinese variety malay and indonesian, western, indian etc lot of variety and famous for satay"
,,Over rated,3.0,,This place has heritage but is over rated. Food is reasonably priced but ordinary. You can find much better food elsewhere in Singapore.
,,"Authentic, cheap and tasty",5.0,,"In a really cool iron building this place has it all when it comes to Asian Delights. We tried food rom over 5 stalls which were all very good, freshly cooked and as authentic as you will get anywhere. Amazing noodles for nothing, great juices and loads of interesting people. No wonder it is full of all the wealthy banker types. You don't need to spend top dollar in this city to get a good meal."
,,"Good food, cheap, nice location.",4.0,,"We ate here a few times during our stay in Singapore. Makes food courts in Australia look very lame. Lots of tasty food options, nice environment, live music was good. We did try the satay which is apparently the thing to try here. The satay guys walk around with a menu, you buy dishes of 10 satay sticks of each meat, we had 30 between two of us, they are smaller than the typical ones in Australia. Meat was chicken, beef and large king prawns. It was just OK, the prawns over cooked and I did find one of the chicken ones to look undercooked. I did have a bit of a dodgy stomach the next day which wasnt fun. I wouldnt bother with the satay, there are lts more options.

Our advice would be look for the busiest stall, the one with a queue or lots of locals eating in front of it. There can be two stalls selling the same types of foods, one will have a long queue the other could have noone ordering. There is a reason for this, go with the busy one. There was a really good curry stall here and there were tons of Indian people sitting out front eating, really tasty and really cheap.

This hawker centre is slightly more expensive but it was easy to have two large meals for less than 10 SGD, we were full and we are two guys. Just dont bother with the satay."
,,"Average food, poor service, nice building!",2.0,,"Lau Pa Sat is a must-try for foreigners in Singapore. I visited it last night (Saturday) with friends and was greeted by a live band. Their music was good. The building and the ambiance are pretty nice as well. That is all for the positive side!

For the negative side, really bad service! All foreigners (ie non Asian looking) are surrounded by waiters and sellers as soon as they step in the area and they stay around the table unless we tell them to leave us alone and have some time to think. Ended up having some Indonesian food at the Indonesian BBQ stall, food was ok but nothing to shout about.

We ordered to another walking seller a satay set of 40 sticks that NEVER came!!! We reminded them twice about our table location but they NEVER came to deliver the food during 30 minutes (yes 30 minutes). So we moved on and ordered satay at another stall and we had food in 5 minutes!!!

I found the area quite dirty for a hawker centre, especially in the city, and the floor was very wet and slippery!

I recommend people to go to Lau Pa Sat, have a drink, take a picture, and then look for some better food outside or in other hawker centres! Will definitely not come back!"
,,Good way to try Singaporean food,5.0,,"Singapore's best asset is the wide variety of excellent food, and Lau Pa Sat is the way to get a glimpse of this. While you will not find the best of the many different cuisines, they are more than worthy representations of the food Singapore has to offer.

Try especially the Char Kway Teow, which is my personal favourite and what I eat everytime I visit."
,,"Forget about restaurants, choose Lau Pa Sat for the many food stalls",5.0,,"There is nothing fancy about Lau Pa Sat but the food is awesome. There is so many different types of cuisine to choose from and they all very good. Stayed for just over a week and dined there almost every day. Getting seats at peak times can be problematic. If you can be a bit flexible with eating times, finding free tables shouldn't be a problem. The satay stalls are mostly open at night. A definite must try when in Singapore.."
,,"Fun option for casual, genuinely local eating in the business district",3.0,,"Another fun hawker center in Singapore's business district.

We dropped in around 4:00 pm for a second lunch (yes, if you only have four days in Singapore you'll have to double up on meals to taste all the great food that's available!) and it was very quiet. One nice thing is that we were not hassled at all by anyone touting for their stall.

We had Indian breads (naan and onion kulcha with curry dips) and a selection of satay, all enjoyable. There are numerous satay stalls if you go to the street at the back, outside the main structure, so it's probably best to make the effort to walk around and select the one you prefer.

Back in 1978 I used to eat here regularly at lunchtime as a cheap and authentic option. I doubt anything has changed since then, and I hope it never does !"
,,the food is average,3.0,,"I have to say this is a huge food court, with a variety of foods which we can choose from, but again sadly to say that, for the three stalls that we tasted, the foods is just very average. good experience though, the food court is located at the centre of financial hub of Singapore."
,,Huge Hawker Center,4.0,,"I went to this place to visit my friend that work nearby. when i come at 11.30 the place is still mostly empty and i choose to sit outside but at 12.10 the place is super packed with office workers. the place is huge and i get lost when im circling the place.

The food is varied from local fare, chinese, indian, malay, to japanese, and korean. i choose to eat rice with char siew and roast pork that cost me 4.5 sgd. the food is good.

lau pa sat it self is famous among tourist and you can see tourist in between office workers. the hawker center interior is open air and classic (singapore classic). the place open 24 hours a day and if you have some spare time you have to visit for some local food."
,,Great experience and worth a try after 7pm for satay,3.0,,I would recommend this place for the experience and the satay. At 7pm the road at the back is closed and the satay stalls are set up outside. The satay is cooked outside and tables are set up in the road - take your camera as its worth taking pictures of the satay being prepared. You need to order quite a bit as the portions are small but good. Don't be taken in by vendors trying to get you to sit in their areas go for Best Satay only as its by far the nicest. Wouldn't recommend this in the day or inside its only worth a visit after 7pm for the Best Satay experience outdoors

,,"Locals think it is over rated, but I like it!",4.0,,Big food court with nice foods of different kinds. For a few dollars you can eat and drink and experience a very lively atmosphere!
,,The most scenic hawker food court in Singapore,5.0,,"Especially on working days, when locals, office workers and tourists alike gather for a quick lunch and build up a vibrant atmosphere, this is the hawker food court to be. There's an abundant choice of meals from all Asian cuisines. I think you can come here for 10 years in a row and never have to eat the same meal. And all tt such cheap prices that you'll never have to leave in disappointment!"
,,"Satay, sAtay, Satay",5.0,,"A satay lovers paradise - better han newton circus, a oad is closed to set up 16 satay stalls and others in the old market. All Singapore food is here. My favourite is Stall No 1 Fatmans satay, but the others are godo too. Watch out for the Tiger girls, one is a miserable old so and so, bt genrally it's good service for food and drink"
,,Full of stalkers,2.0,,"I heard so much about this food market I was excited to come, however the whole experience was disappointing.

From the outset we were bombarded by staff trying to make us order from their stalls, and whilst we walked around looking at what there was on offer they continued to follow us around the stalls- it was highly irritating.

We settled for chicken rice in the end... the rice was greasy and oily, whilst the chicken was dry and tough... despite the cheap(ish) price I had expected more.

Better off spending your money elsewhere, or paying a little more for better food."
,,Poor ventilation,3.0,,"Though the place is very much a tourist attraction and favourite among local night owls, the place could do with some improvements in the ventilation.
Walking through the hawker, I saw and smelt smoke from the cooking. It came to a point when I felt so stuffy, I had to request to get out of the centre itself.
It certainly did not help that I was wearing smell-absorbing clothes that evening. AHH... I smelt like a smoked duck/chicken for the rest of the night...... :/"
,,Satay Club @ Lau Pa Sat is not to be missed,5.0,,"Without doubt my favourite dining experience in Singapore would have to be the Satay Club adjacent to Lau Pa Sat. This is what eating is all about. It will always be the first thing I do when visting Singapore and one of my favourite dinining experiences anywhere in the world. The colour, the flames, the smoke, the smell, it assaults every sense. At 60cents a satay it is affordable and at 16 dollars a jug of beer, it's some of the cheapest beer in Singapore. If you head to Singapore, this is a must."
,,Nice for Atmosphere,4.0,,Lots of variety with good food. Had chilli crab which was ok but crabs are much smaller than say Long Beach Restaurant or Jumbos. Make sure to work out the price first. The Satays were very good and especially the BBQ prawns. Overall not bad.
,,A zoo,2.0,,"Went here last month with some colleagues for lunch and my goodness the place was a zoo: chop'd tables everywhere, long lines for very ordinary hawker food, cockroaches scuttling around our feet, ancient aunties and uncles working far too hard with little respect from the diners. Won't return."
,,This is the place to eat,4.0,,"If you enjoy food, then this is the place for you. This was my first trip to Singapore, and Lau Pa Sat really is the place to eat. During the day, many stalls are closed, but comes night, and this place is filled up. There are enormous variety to choose from and the satay and crabs are real delights."
,,Late Nite,3.0,,"Trying to find good food and halal as well not easy especially when its late at night in Singapore. Ended up at Lau Pa Sat. Around 11.30pm only few eating outlets so the choice is limited. Eating satay....its bit hard except the gravy is nice. If you expect proper cutlery, that is not the place!"
,,Run down place,2.0,,"The place is kind of run down with lots of stalls closed. The place is quite dirty too. You can go try out the place if you don't mind the dirty sight and unhygienic look of the place.
Though it is open space, it is quite hot eating in there."
,,Evening Street Satay = Amazing!,5.0,,"We were recommended to go here on our fist night in Singapore and this remained our favourite eating experience! When you walk through the indoor stalls all is quite, then you step out onto All About Satay and wow! you are confronted with the most amazing smell of sizzling satay cooking on a BBQ in the middle of a blocked off road in the financial district. We chose tno, 7&8 and no regrets, it was all delicious. We also ordered many jugs of Tiger Beer from the ladies who walked around in between the tables. Great views, great atmosphere and most importantly, awesome food! Definately going back here!"
,,Economy meals in business district,4.0,,Located in business distric excellent place if you are staying in business are..a large complex where you have numerous food stalls and many options... the street becomes satay street from 7 pm.....as the traffic is stopped and there are tables out on the road and frest satay to enjoy and that too very reasobale around S$6 for 10 satay sticks.....
,,A historical place,4.0,,A place with wonderful and decent Singapore local foods. The architectural of Lau Pa Sat is very nice.... You can enjoy live bands ( not sure which day) while you have the foods there.
,,Satay Street is great,5.0,,"I take all my visitors to Singapore to Lau Pa Sat to sit out in the street, and feast on Satay's and other great local dishes. The locals of course say it is only for tourists, but it is still great - and cheap by western standards."
,,A huge choice of good quality and clean places to eat in one hawker centre,4.0,,A great place to sample the atmosphere of Singapore. Sitting in the out doors on plastic garden furniture smelling the satay cooking whilst being offered menus at drink at your table by a variety of food providers. Not too pushy but just offering their food. It's great to have a mixture of foods swilled down with a beer or lime juice in the evening warmth of Simgapore. Definetely worth a visit and because it is Singapore of course it is clean.
,,Mouthwatering satay,5.0,,The satay here gets great reviews. Well worth the visit. Also if you are a tourist you can come here and take the train from Raffles place to City Hall (next stop) to visit the Chimjes area for some drinks. If it's you first time visiting an Asian country be aware that the vendors try to haggle. It's a common practice in Asia and you will get used to it after a while.
,,Good Western Burgers/RaVISHING BBG SATAYS (STALL 8),1.0,,"Best Renditions of Malay BB Satays(Stall 8) , Seafood Mee Goreng(Chinese Vesion) Behind Stall 8 , and excellent Western Burgers WENDYS . Rest of food Average , advailable throughout Spore-No big Deal"
,,Crowded and Lotsa Food!,3.0,,Very crowded on weekdays afternoons as the office crowd flock to the market. Otherwise deserted during other timing. Lots of food at night to cater to everyone!
,,Authentic Far East experience,3.0,,"It's a must visit place once in your trip to Singapore. We had satay, but there were all other kinds of foods available - mostly oriental and Indian in nature. The atmosphere is dirty and the building is covered in soot and pollution.
The architecture is something to behold and the experience of sitting in the middle of the juxtaposition of a cultural complex vs the modern, urban financial centre with tall glass buildings all around, was quite something!"
,,Lau Pa Sat is a Food Court.,3.0,,"This is food court, with many stalls selling asian foods. Price are slighty expensive. This food court, is really famous for ""Satay"" - {asian meat/chicken stick}. But toilet is not clean."
,,An enjoyable evening !,3.0,,"Lau Pa Sat, a hawker centre in Singapore. Nice BBQ fish, chicken wings and chilli crab﹗The satay is just average, a bit too sweet. Yummy food with resonable price. Better go in the evening."
,,Great food centre.,5.0,,"There are lots of food centres in Singapore. Lau Pa Sat is one of the great food centre, with variety of choise. Satty (Stall 7-8), Char kway teow is good."
,,Lost its touch,2.0,,I must say that this iconic pavilion has lost its flavor over the years. It has lost its charm. The prices of food is soaring with quality dipping. Too much competition between vendors vying for customers.
,,Best Satay stand is number 7-8,4.0,,"It is very delicious and no upset stomach the next day which is very important for street food stand! We ordered 130 piece (meat, chicken and prawns) they de-shell the prawns comes with head and tail on a skewer, SUPERB, but my favorite was still mutton! They keep filling your glass with beer so try to slow them down for over pouring!
There are heaps of them but 7-8 I think is by far the best compared all the satays I had other places."
,,Satay - nom nom,4.0,,"The Satay at this market are sensational. We tried 2 different vendors and ate 50 satay sticks between us, they were very good. My favourite was the chicken, the beef and mutton were excellet also. Hubby also had steamed BBQ pork buns which he rated as excellent. Well worth a visit here and the atmosphere is great."
,,Normal food court with tourist crowd,3.0,,Went to eat at this place since this is the nearest from our hotel. A bit letdown since I'm expecting much from this. The inside dining area can be crowded sometimes and the band playing inside can be annoying at times. The food is just average and the price seems reasonable.
,,Good place to grab lunch,4.0,,"I work just along the road from this place... basic but great food selection, clean and tasty. The must take photo is the ""Pig Organ Soup"" sign - look out for it."
,,Mountain of Choice but a bit of a pain.,3.0,,"Old setting but mainly for tourists, lots of choice but pushy vendors, especially satay vendors start the minute you enter with a mass of plastic covered menu's shoved in your face. Price good for Singapore although I am sure there are more better price ones that the locals use. Not a bad experience and I got some tasty Vietnamese food. Maybe give it a go but not a must at all."
,,Satay stall that run by 'mafia',1.0,,"We were there for satay and as there were not sign stating on patrons must sit infront of the satay stall, we were to another stall to place our order. To our surprise, the stall that we wanted to order don't even dare to take our order cos his 'mafia' neighbour stall were scolding and staring. What a lousy experiences we had and that was the last time we eat at that so called satay place!"
,,Its a must do hawker centre,5.0,,"Nothing fancy about Lau Pa Sat, its rustic and basic but its by far my favorite place to have a great value evening meal enjoying really good food that will barely put a scratch on your budget. It is in my opinion the best of all the hawker food centres I've experienced, with plenty of variety in food but my favorite is the satay stalls. Its clearly popular with the locals and can get very busy but its a great atmosphere and a must place to eat for any visitor."
,,"Its the marketing tactic, not the quality",2.0,,"Lau Pa Sat has been a very historical building in Singapore, dating abck to the colonial time. It has been renovated in the 80-90s to ensure its continuous survival.

The place is basically a hawker centre operating on 24 hours basis. My wife worked near by and in the past and we went there for dinner on a few ocassions.

However, be warn if you intend to go there for a taste of Singapore Delicacy. If the place is operating at 24 hours basis, you can forget about finding good food around. Imagine that the food is prepared for a full day operation and by the time you order your dish, you won't know when they are prepared. There is little consideration for quality at all.

I do not find the food served by the hawker stall there attractive, there are other hawker centres in Singapore that serve much better than these junk.

Probably the only exception would be the BBQ stalls next to the satay street which operates only in the evening. The price is still reasonable and they do serve hot spicy freshly cooked stuff.

The other part of the place you may consider is the satay street which only opens at night. You can experience the open air eatery which serves a traditional Malay delicacy. Price may be a little higher than others on this island, but you won't get this kind of ambience any more in Singapore except here.

So my suggestion is, forget the hawker stalls inside the Lau Pa Sat, go for the open air in the evening and you will find your money better spent."
,,Conventional.....although there are some special things too!,3.0,,"I've visited this place for many times already and I could say that the typical Singaporean mainstays are similar to the ones you will find at regular hawker centers. In terms of culinary preparations, there are still restaurants who try to prepare meals by their bare hands. I am particularly sensitive in hygienic preparations for food. Also, the food prices here are a bit pricey compared to other regular hawkers. You might even find the quality and price of food better at other hawker stores.

But what makes this place special for me are these 3 things: 1. The architecture of the interior and the exteriors, 2. The presence of Filipino dishes and 3. the live entertainment during the evenings.

I will still be back for sure as I regularly bring along my Filipino visitors here when they visit Singapore."
,,Go for the experience,4.0,,"This hawker centre is particularly interesting because of the Victorian wrought-iron work that makes it look a bit quaint in such a modern part of town. Inside there are the usual million or so stalls with different foods, and when I was there last there was a live band playing as well.

Noisy, hot and sweaty, food not pretty but quite passable.... definitely worth a visit.."
,,large variety hawker centre,5.0,,"Now this is is a good hawker centre. Lots of variety. Went twice in one trip. There is a massive variety of food from Chinese, Malay, Indian, and Indo. The second time I went was in the evening and there was a 4 piece band playing cheesy pop songs which was great! Around the back is a large Indo satay section. I guess you got to try it, lots to choose from and lots of them ushering you to their store."
,,Good local food at unbeatable prices,5.0,,"This is a must stop in Singapore. Immense choice of Chinese, Indian, Japanese, Korean and even the odd Western food. The atmosphere is a bit surreal, a huge Victorian pavilion with countless tables to choose from. You get your food and sit anywhere, and just leave when you are done. Staff will pick up your dirty plates and return them to their respective shops. In the evening sometimes there is a but of a surreal atmosphere, with a band blasting away from a stage in the middle of the court. No A/C but lots of fans on the ceiling. Prices are really low and you get tons of food. A very full meal will set you back 10-15 S$ max, but you can eat for half that much. I am a regular whenever I am in Singapore."
,,DINNER,3.0,,"Wnet for a family outoing as usual over the weekend and decided to have our dinner and notice lots of new stalls establish for not local but asean foods ?
Seating was just infront of the sugarcane juice stall and started to order with the eager representatives from various stall awaiting our order.
Kids had their usual noodles soup.Wife and I had seafood sting ray with lots of sambal chili (portion was for 1 person) veggy was done not we expected and the sambal clams were just not to our flavour.Fried hokkien mee without MSG can try.
Ambience is smoky for the barbecue of satays all round and notice the ceiling fans were wobbling profusely just waiting for an accident to occur ?
Left with sadness as being the icon for local food it sure reflect some ""bad images"" to our country.

Toilets if possible ""avoid"""
,,Sooo much choice!,5.0,,"A huge hawker stall food court with a fantastic choice of food from all over the world. I was spoilt for choice and the food is really cheap but good quality. It is also in a really good location, just a short walk from the Marina."
,,Solid venue but tired.,3.0,,"There are many other places in SG that are doing this better. Shame because they secured a good venue. Just ""not bad""."
,,Quaint Food Court,4.0,,"Within the food court, there's food galore from hot and spicy to sweet and nourishing. Outside the road is cordoned off after 7 pm in the evening to all vehicular traffic and converted to a pedestrian mall. Table and chairs are quickly set up along the road and soon after drifts the fragrance of bar-be-qued dishes ( also called satay ) on skewers. Great place to dine with friends after a hard day's work. This place attracts the office crowd from the financial district of Singapore."
,,Best place to eat!,5.0,,"This was the best place to eat by far in the whole of Singapore. Open all hours this hawker food hall is amazing. The atmosphere and experience is one you should have if you visit the area. Everyone from locals to bankers use this place for food. It's great being able to go with friends and all have something different from different stallholders.

My tip is the chicken and rice man in the centre, he also does pork noodles but his traditional chicken, rice, greens and broth is perfect! Or the bbq places that do the satay sticks under the stars at night and just keep on bringing them fresh to your table until you say stop.

Very cheap too!"
,,Enjoyable except for possible criminal elements,3.0,,"We had supper in Lau Pa Sat (at the closed-off street section) and enjoyed the best satay in Singapore along with Tiger beer. Very laid back atmosphere, perfect for catching up with friends over beer and good food. In addition to Satay, we had (and highly recommend) the grilled Stingray and cereal prawn.

Unfortunately, this happy experience was dampened by my husband losing his wallet while on the premises. We were getting ready to leave when he realized that his wallet was missing. It's possible that it fell from his pocket (while seated) and someone took it or that someone picked it from his pocket directly. People from Lau Pa Sat offered that their CCTV camera might be helpful - but it didnt help as they said (we didn't get to see first hand) the picture was too dark to reveal anything. The next day, they called to say that someone had found the wallet - the didn't say who, how or where they found it - all the money was gone but at least the identification cards were still there. I was really disappointed by this experience especially since this was Singapore - a supposedly safe place esp for tourists."
,,Decent spread of food,4.0,,"Good selection of food, just depends on which stall you order from. Can't go wrong with the ones with long queues.. =)"
,,Best satay in Singapore,4.0,,"Eat outside at the back. Teases all the senses. Great food, reasonably priced. Vendors will direct you to a table, order your food, and it's brought to the table."
,,Best satay in town!,5.0,,"Do you miss the old satay club from years back in Singapore? Then head to Lau Pa Sat, you won't be disappointed. I always go for stall number 8 which to my taste serve the best satays."
,,"Bit of a zoo, but one you must experience",3.0,,"Wow I went to Lau Pa Sat for lunch this week. It was around 12:30pm and I was in the vicinity, so followed the crowds of bankers and hangers-on and went over for a quick bite. Quick ? My goodness there must have been a thousand people jostling to get their noodles, chopeing their tables so there's nowhere to sit once you have your food. Old uncles & aunties slowly clearing the tables and giving them a cursory wipe. I had Japanese, which was OK if not brilliant. Really the experience was quite something and one I'd recommend, if not for the food itself."
,,Must see in Singapore!,4.0,,"Loved the atmosphere of this place, lots of hustle and bustle and a great place for people watching. Taxi driver said the satay was good, which is what I had already resourced, and it was! We were seated out by stalls 7 & 8 for the satay and it was thoroughly enjoyable! Lots of wonderful food aromas, tall skyscrapers surrounding us and a beautiful heritage building full of amazing food stalls. A balmy Singapore evening, a few jugs of tiger beer kept cold in a bowl of ice, amazing food! A most enjoyable Singapore experience! Definitely a must do in Singapore."
,,"Fun, interesting and worth a visit",4.0,,"Lau Pa Sat is well worth a visit to get a real feeling for the Hawker Centre culture. A vast array of Asian cuisine is on offer on from the many stalls in this large Victorian structure that is very close to the heart of the City. Busy at lunchtime, it comes alive at night, when the public road running alongside is shut and becomes a vast open air restaurant, full of satay stalls and tables. Full of atmposphere it is well worth the visit. It attracts more tourist traffic in the evening, and the prices are rather greater than the typical hawker centre (particularly from the satay vendors outside), but it is well regulated and standards are high. There is a certain amount of touting for business on the outside from the different vendors, but it all adds to the fun of a great evening out. Highly recommended."
,,Needs a good cleaning,1.0,,"Went hear on the weekend for a quick lunch while we were on our way to the new Marina Bay Gardens. Place was relatively quiet as the CBD does not have much going on during the weekend. Decided to have some Pho soup. While waiting for our soup, couldn't help but noticed the thick layer of grime and dirt on the ceiling fixtures, fans, vents, etc. Was hoping it wouldn't land in our food. Little did we know, that was the least of our worries.

Food came and started eating. Soup was okay, nothing spectacular until I looked down to find a rather large bug (I'll leave the type of bug out for the squeamish) in my husband's soup. Needless to say, if there's one bug in the place, there has to be many. Maybe we just had a bad experience, but I won't be going back. Someone needs to take a giant powerwasher and clean the place up before I would step back in there. I should note, that I have eaten at other hawker stands and don't expect it to look pristine, but this was over the top."
,,Enjoy the tastes of Singapore!,5.0,,"Went to Lau Pa Sat 19/8/12, the Sunday night of a long weekend in Singapore, had a table outside on the closed off street. The night was warm, the food was all styles of spicy meat, seafood and vegetables.
Try the satay sticks, cood beer and the stingray...a very interesting taste.
The atmosphere was friendly and happy with families from toddlers to us ""oldies"".
A fun night of food and laughter!"
,,Great Satay at night,4.0,,Huge hawker centre that has all the normal good hawker food but we went there for the nightly satay and we weren't dissapointed. They close off the street at night and all the satay stalls start cooking. It puts you off a bit when the stall holders pounce on you as soon as you walk in and try to direct you to their food. They leave you alone once you've got some food though . Satay from #7 was great. There are ladies who keep bringing out the tiger beer by glass or jug so you don't need to even get up from your chair. Not sure which stall it came from as the guy came out to our table but we bought some really nice murtabak.
,,Great Food Center,4.0,,"Too bad we got there a bit late and most of the places were closed. Has the chance to have great seafood, deliccious rice and the coldest beer that day"
,,Indian or Chicken Rice,5.0,,Love this place the Vegetarian Indian on the Robinson Rd side of the market has the best Dosa in Singapore. Excellent chicken rice as well
,,Big Bytes,5.0,,"Best Place to eat Indian Food such as Dosa, Idle in this area. Podi Dosa is my favourite and Mini Idle is wonderfull..."
,,not much selection,3.0,,"normal food we can find in our locale coffee shop.with cheaper price,but the night time one side of the road would be close for chairs and table is quite abit difference feeling."
,,Street Satay by night,4.0,,"Stall 7 & * have the best satays compared to all other stalls as I have tasted almost all. This stall's satays do not have the skin or fats , just tasty chicken meat only. The mutton satays are well marinated and tasty. And of course the peanut sauce - you can never get enough of it."
,,HISTORIC HAWKER FOOD CENTER,5.0,,This food center is in a beautiful old building and very well laid out. It has all the usual hawker food but is a very upmarket look compared to most other food centers in Singapore. It should be a must see place for all tourists as the place is a heritage building being looked after by the government for good reason.
,,"Some great food here, especially satay!",4.0,,"A bit tired-looking (it is a historic building in it's defense) but some of best food in Singapore can be found here in the evenings. BBQ stingray, satay and rojak are notable. After living here more than a decade, I think this is the best place for satay in town, although which stall serves it is always changing and up for debate."
,,Boon Tat BBQ Seafood - excellent,5.0,,"I tracked down Lau Par Sat upon the recommendation of a local friend. I'm a lone traveller and wanted good food but I'm not a fan of sitting in fancy restaurants on my own.

Firstly, this place was recommended due to its rather impressive Victorian ironwork and it was indeed impressive.

Secondly, it was recommended for the food. And if there's one things the Singaporeans know about, it's food!

I must say that inside, it didn't look too promising (food wise) - not a very high level of occupancy at the tables and certainly no queues at any of the stalls (the best way to tell which one you should be choosing).

There were a couple of people touting for business - I had read that any establishment that feels the need to tout for business in Singapore, as opposed to waiting for the local to queue up is clearly to be avoided - good advice I think.

On the far side of the market, however, I found Boon Tat BBQ Seafood. It's within the iron structure but faces outwards where there are many tables - these were nearly all full - this is what I was looking for.

Upon sitting down, I was presented with a large photo menu card, but I decided to just ask what the waiter recommended. Despite not being the biggest, most central dish on the menu, he said that the stingray with sambal was by far the best dish. It came in small, medium and large options (maybe $12/$16/$18 from memory).

It was absolutely fantastic - I'm considering going back there tonight. And, unlike many places that I've been to in this part of the world, they didn't tone down the chili for the silly foreigner - I love hot food and this was perfect for me, but, oh boy, was it hot!"
,,A historic hawker centre - for eating more than shopping,4.0,,"TA has this listed as a shopping centre, and has a separate listing for it as a restaurant. It is neither - but rather a (food) hawker centre, with historic roots going back to 1822 and 1894.

TA asks if there ""a fee for this attraction."" Technically, no. You can walk around gratis. But it's all about economical and delicious food, and visitors may be remiss if they do not sample their way through the place."
,,"Ready for its next refreshing, but still great.",4.0,,"This is not a ""restaurant,"" but rather a hawker centre with very historic roots and a diversity of food sellers within and around the place.

I first visited this historic (vintage 1894 for the current structure, though previous facilities date from 1822) place (as Telok Ayer) in 1974. Over 1986-89 it was given a complete restoration/renovation, and renamed Lau Pa Sat. With management outsourced to a succession of firms, it was refurbished again in 1996. It's still a good place to visit downtown, for its historic architecture and good food from diverse hawker stalls. On the Wednesday evening we visited, there was live music from an elevated stage in the centre."
,,"Fun place, great satay, cold beer...",4.0,,"The place itself is a must see - reminiscent of another era, attractive and airy and oh so pretty! The food, now... First time around we had the satay at no8 satay stall - all of their satays were great but their prawns are tops - juicy, flavorful, cooked to perfection. We also had the banana leaf stingray which was nice but not much else - we had better blackened stingray in Malaysia and in other Singaporean places. Also, we had some indian food which was so and so. So, second time around (there is always a second time and a third and a fourth in such fun places), we stayed with the satay and didn't bother with the rest. Oh, yes, we also had and lots and lots of beer off course! A night to remember - so, my two cents, stay with the satay, preferably the prawns at stall no8 and order lots of cold beer."
,,11.55am,5.0,,This is an experience at lunchtime during the week. Get there before midday and watch the place fill up. Take your little packet of tissues to reserve your table. place your umbrella or tissues on the table and then head off to make your choice. (Take careful note of whhere your table is!!) I have been a few times but really like the Vietnamese rice paper rolls and my favorite is the traditional (pork) xiao long bao from the stall in the middle. At night there are the satay stalls outside. They are all much of the same but I got mine from stall 7&8.
,,Great variety a must go,5.0,,"you want it, you got it here! fun place to go with a huge choice of cuisine. try a little of each if you can, it's a worthwhile destination. Lots of different cultures come here for food, great people watching place...."
,,The best Char Kway Teow!!,4.0,,"I always go here if I crave one! You should try it, just look for the stall with people falling in line especially on lunch time."
,,Great variety!,4.0,,"Awesome variety - Lots of cuisines. Indian, chinese, thai, singaporean... Onestop for all kinds of food, juices, desserts.. Definitely worth going!"
,,a convenient way to taste Singaporean cuisine,4.0,,"First of all it's location is quite tourist-friendly thanks to its proximity to the Merlion (approx 15 mins on foot). With Lau Pa Sat you don't need to squeeze into MRT and get to the hawker centres in the residential areas across the northern part of the city state.

When it comes to the food, you can find almost all kinds of Singaporean cuisine there, ranging from satay to seafood, from laksa to tofu soup. I would say the prices are reasonable as it is a tourist attraction after all.

On weekdays, dinner is more preferable as it is swamped with white collars who work nearby during lunch hours."
,,Lunch,3.0,,Not that many options for vegetarians. There are not many shops that cater to vegetarians. Some of the shops were closed too in the afternoon.
,,A good place for eats,4.0,,It's crowded on weekday lunches - what else is there to say to testify about? Office workers throng the place for makan. So weekday lunches are a very crowded affair. But it also means you can see which queue is the longest - indicating which food is the best.
,,Shadow of former self,3.0,,"There are tour buses parked outside now, the food is expensive and so-so. Rickety stools and lack of fans do not make it an enoyable dining destination"
,,Nice foodie place!,4.0,,"If you are craving for different kinds of food, there's one place to be - Lau Pa Sat!"
,,"Old and Amazing, but not great for food",3.0,,"Lau Pa Sat is a great building. It is worthwhile to see what was built as a temporary structure in the 1890s and is stil standing today.
The food is a mixed bag. If the satay sellers try to bully and intimidate you, just say that you have a mate at the NEA and STA and you write on trip advisor. They can be real jerks...dont worry about offending them. it is worth a look but not a family place."
,,Favorite Hawker center,4.0,,"This is my favorite hawker center in SG, there is a huge selection and after 6 they close down the street to cars and the Satay guys come out"
,,One of our favourite places,5.0,,"The satay's are wonderful, lunch time you can get a cheap meal from inside. At night sit outside and just enjoy. Always by tissues or wipes and leave them on the table to ensure you don't lose your place."
,,"Fantastic food, great atmosphere, great prices!",5.0,,"This feels authentic and genuine with a great choice of Asian cuisines and good value. Clean, friendly and a great Singapore food experience! One of the better, or possibly best hawker food markets I visited whilst in town."
,,Great place to sample Singapore food,4.0,,"Brought an Australian friend who was in town here for some local food. We ordered some dishes from one of the seafood stores. It was the store which had their staff in bright orange shirts.

The butter calamari was the best we've had, and the stingray was nicely done as well. Our order of fried baby kailan vegetables came out a little oily but had a nice crunch to it.

There was a band playing in the middle of the pavilion and that gave it a nice ambience as we'd gone in to get dessert."
,,Great choice of food in unique building,5.0,,this is an octagon-shaped building with 8 'streets' or food alleys coming off the central part. there's a big choice of all types of Asian food. it's essentially a hawker centre so the food is cheap but your bonus is dining within a beautiful Victorian ironwork structure. It gets hot so sit right under a fan if you can. It would be hard to recommend any particular food as I've been here several times and it's always tasty. I enjoy being in the building as much as I enjoy eating here.
,,So so satays,3.0,,"It was a disappointment.

Been here at different times and occasions the last 2 decades. One of the joy was the late night satay stalls. This time was not good.

The building is still charming but not the food. We rolled up for a very late dinner. I didn't expect a full house on a Monday night but great satays were expected.

One good thing was the live band playing on top of a juice bar."
,,Lau Makan store,4.0,,"Satay was good, Teh ginger soso, I like the nite freedom to park style, give me peace of mind eating situation............"
,,Becoming more and more average,3.0,,"This place used to house the better loal food stalls but it's a bit disappointing after tonight's dinner. Ordered the satay from stall asli and the beef and chicken were hard. Fat boy is still the best.

The zhi char was average too. The BBQ stingray is tasteless, if there's no chilli in top of it!"
,,not enough options,3.0,,"they could do with more healthy and vegetarian friendly food options. the options that you have there aren't bad, but it gets tiring if you have special dietary needs, like healthy food or vegetarian food. so it gets a little tricky.."
,,Tourist prices at a hawker center,2.0,,"I took some tourist friends here for the ""local"" experience and paid ridiculous prices for the food and beer. Trust me, its cheaper to take a taxi to Kallang or East Coast Seafood centre and back. Not going back to this rip-off."
,,Must do in Singapore,4.0,,We had lunch here and really enjoyed all the food we had. So many good dishes to choose from and the prices are so good that you might want to get more than you know you can eat! Will definitely go again when in Singapore.
,,Reasonable place for food in city area,4.0,,"not the cheapest, not the best food and not the cosiest but always full of lunch and dinner crowds because u can find many types of cuisines there at affordable prices for both locals and foreigners.."
,,Great satay but expensive,4.0,,"Aggressive sales people that follow you until you sit down at one of their stands. Satay is great, freshly made over charcoal BBQ. Beer can only be ordered in a jug. Can spend $ 50 easily with 4 people and not be full. Should try once if you are a true satay lover but if you want to spend less go the East Coast food center."
,,goods are great,4.0,,"you can choose a varieaty of foods,,chnese ,,muslim n filipino foods,,,u can choose also fresh seafoods and ask what kind of menu yu want"
,,It's only a food court - yet it is not!,5.0,,"This place is as old as the country Singapore! Don't miss out on the small arch at the front of the entry, which has some history engraved in a granite stone; rather interesting.

And btw, technically, this place is just a giant food court, so I wouldn't recommend traveling all the way just to visit, but if you are in the CBD area anywhere, and feel like (cheap!) local delicacies, this is a must go. it has 100s of stalls ranging from Singaporean to Taiwanese bento to Indian food to Mongolian hot pot rice.

Be aware though, no ac here..."
,,Singapore hawker history,5.0,,"The oldest hawker centre in Singapore (still standing) and also home to the best bespoke tailor in town Dylan and Sons. Visit for the iron architecture, stay for the food and then get yourself measured for a wonderful sharp suit."
,,Wide selection but not on weekends,4.0,,"Good selection of local cuisine, mostly average to above average in taste and quality and prices. But limited selections on weekends as the office crowd don't work those days."
,,Great food,5.0,,"Lots of great food, plenty of choice, in a historical building. Must do."
,,My favorite food court,5.0,,This is the best food court in the middle of Singapore CBD. This used to be my lunch place for over a decade till my office decided to move to a business park. The diversity and the variety of food you can get here is amazing (it ranges from the whole world!). The prices are very affordable. The evening Satay Street is an amazing experience.
,,"Great Venue, Poorly executed!",3.0,,"Lau Pa Sat, is an old market, wrought iron, and very reminescent of colonial splendour. In typical Singaporean fashion, they have taken away the soul of the place to cram in as many food stalls(most mediocre at best in quality, and taste), and present a sterile version of a real food court! For the first time tourist it may seem exotic, but venture a little further afield for better food, at cheaper prices; Old Airport Road, or Zion Road, would be a good counterpoint to Lau Pa Sat."
,,Night Bites,4.0,,Hungry at night? This place stays open late with some stays open 24 hrs.
,,So-so food court but large,3.0,,"This the tourist rip-off version of the famous SIngapore food courts, but they do have a very good selection of stands. Much better off trying the many local food courts"
,,Loved Lau Pa Sat,5.0,,"I visited Lau Pa Sat twice on a recent visit to Singapore - and loved it. We sat outside near the satay stalls, and started off with delicious chicken and beef satays. Then it was on to the char kway teoh noodles, mee goreng, carrot cake (savoury, not sweet, and completely addictive), dumplings, and BBQ prawns. All delicous. Great to sit outside on a balmy night and to enjoy local food and local drinks (tiger beer and sugar cane juice), great atmosphere, reasonably priced. Would also recommend the hawker food market at Smith Street in Chinatown for lunch (more of a locals hangout than a tourist hangout)."
,,All Kinds of Food,3.0,,"You can find almost any kind of cuisine here. Located at the heart of the CBD in Singapore, this is a good place to dine either on a busy workday or just chill out after work."
,,first taste of Singapore,4.0,,"This was the first place my friends took me within an hour of landing in Singapore....Hokkien Mee, satay stall #8 (the best!), cereal prawns, mmmm!!!"
,,Awesome hawker centre,5.0,,"I eat lunch here at 2-3 times a week. Great range of food, freshly cooked. Avoid between 12.30pm - 1.15pm if you can't handle crowds, it's where all the locals eat. It's a must see / eat experience in Singapore"
,,Good place for satay,4.0,,Not for lunch in a place too hot and humid. The satay stalls only opens in the night.
,,"Splendid Building, Great Variety, Good Food",5.0,,"We had the good sense to show up a few minutes before the noontime crowd innundated the place. Lau Pa Sat is a renovated former market in a grand old pavilion of Victorian gingerbread wrought iron. There's a stunning range of food stalls. To give an idea of the variety, I had Andhra-style Indian food, while Elizabeth had bangers-and-mash. She thought her sausage, mashed potatoes, gravy and toast were excellent (S$8.00). I had a big pile of rice, chicken masala, curried potatoes, a fabulous spicy bitter gourd dish, and a papadam, all for S$5.00. A can of Tiger Beer was reasonably priced, for Singapore, at S$3.70. Great place, great deal all around.

One more note: A number of reviewers have called this place ""touristy"" and complained about over-pushy satay touts. Virtually all of these people apparently came in the evening. During the day, the crowd is almost all Singaporeans (including some resident expats). This is a very, very popular place with the financial center office types. It can be extremely busy from about noon until 1:00, but in no way is it touristy during the day."
,,Hawker fare at CBD pricing,4.0,,"Good variatey of local fare, at a slightly dearer pricing"
,,"Splendid Building, Stunning Variety of Good Food",5.0,,"We had the good sense to show up a few minutes before the noontime crowd innundated the place.

Great place, great deal all around."
,,Not the best,3.0,,"Certainly not the best street food but gives a good idea of what is available in Singapore if you are a visitor. But if you would like to try satay, visit it in the evening when the 'Satay Club' commences business on the road right right next to it. (The road will be closed to traffic for this purpose.)"
,,All what you want,4.0,,You dream of any food across Asia and get it here. Very popular for Satay in the evenings.
,,Since Singapore is about good food and more good food...,5.0,,Wait till after 730 pm for the Satay stalls to be opened. There are about 10-12 stalls in total and each stall has their own unique satay and satay sauces. This is also a great place to catch a Malay or Indian speaking Mandarin.
,,Must go!,5.0,,"Such a good mix of food served, wish I had more time to taste. Only annopyance are the satay sellers who harras endlessly if you go anywhere near them. Just buy some though and the problem is solved."
,,Beware of the pushy stall staff !,4.0,,"The whole Lau Pa Sat experience at night is good, as

1. you are in the CBD area, next to the Shore
2. the night stalls have its unique Singapore style
3. the food is nice, and in-expensive in western standards.

what can affect you experience are the very pushy staff trying to push (verbally and almost physically) you to sit and buy from their food stalls, for me I will just ignore them. However they are always in-your-face until you sit down somewhere else, which is not very nice. I suppose people should help eradicating this behaviour by not buying from the stalls which has very pushy sales staff."
,,Great Experience!,5.0,,"Always a great time and perfect place to take visitors. Street satay at it's best. Booths 7 and 8 are fantastic..chicken and prawn satay is fantastic, with beer girls always on-hand to bring a cold pitcher of beer when you beckon!"
,,"Good food, really hot though!",3.0,,"I have to admit that some of the stalls serve really good fare here. But it's also really hot and if you want to visit, wear something cool and try to find a table that is near a fan!"
,,Only in the evening worth a visit,3.0,,"Day time it is the lunch place for office workers all around, the place has some history and a wide variety of food but I would not say exceptional. Evening time, they will close one of the side road and you have seatings on the public road - pretty cool! and satay - local ""kebab"" sort with peanut sauce. Worth a visit in the evening but if you are in a hurry - probably not"
,,cool,3.0,,"just cool to be visited, try to go at night, gets better"
,,average food,3.0,,"sure the building is iconic and beautiful. but the food is average. we got information from the web that this hawker is still open until pass midnight. but when we got there, there's a lot of stall already closed so it didnt left us with many choice."
,,"Iconic hawker centre, but average food quality",3.0,,Nothing to complain about the place ..... it is just average. Not a place I will travel to just for its food. Very useful for the financial district crowd - comparatively cheap food vs the expensive eateries in that area.
,,Plain,3.0,,Opened with much fanfare and pretty over rated and more for the CBD working crowd and also for tourist. Can get better food elsewhere
,,Good place to be. Blend in like a local!,4.0,,"Lao Pa Sat is a food complex with so many choices which you could eat here for days. The price is CHEAP. This place is a true representative of Singapore where evey culture merge together nicely, its fusion. It lights up especially at night when the satay BBQ has started. Read through a lot of comments about this place, it could be scary if you it is your first time to be there since all BBQ owners are trying to push you to buy their satay. but again, the money is yours, you have the say. pick the number you like, ask the price, and enjoy like the locals!"
,,Brilliant satay!!!,4.0,,"We arrived at the hawker centre and then looked around for the street of satay stalls that get set up every evening at 7pm. It wasn't hard to spot. As I had read, we were immediately confronted by satay touts, trying to get us to order from their stall. We walked up the street and back to the stall 8 which people on Tripadvisor had recommended. The cost was more that we had paid for satay elsewhere, but the atmosphere was more like our memory of our last visit to Singapore. We had an enormous pile of satay sticks; DH had a jug of Tiger beer with me intending to share some with lemonade but then we discovered the shop we had ordered from didn't have lemonade. I had Coke while DH managed to drink the whole jugful. Glad he wasn't driving. It was an enjoyable meal and has now re-ignited our love of satay."
,,Geoff b,1.0,,"Went for satay, far too pushy, better in a non tourist area/"
,,So many options!,4.0,,"A great hawker centre in the middle of the CBD. Really great options. No one will go hungry. Some evenings (weekends?) offer satay choices outside when they close off the street. Really good, but hot and humid to be outside."
,,Unhygenic,2.0,,Good for people who look for variety in food. The smell and crowd with the litter is an off factor for me. Never keen to go there even though its the nearest from my office!
,,Unique Hawker centre experience with reasonably good food,5.0,,"If you do go to Lau Pa Sat and wish to try satay, the best I would recommend is Fatman Satay (Stall no 1). These satay stalls ar set up at the side road after the road is closed off to traffic in the evening. When facing the row of stay stalls from the road, Fatman Satay is located at the extreme right. You will for some reason(more effective touting or strategic location) find the stalls in the middle having more customers but these customers most of whom are tourists do not realise that the best stay is at the stall on the extreme right. You will find more locals at Fatman Satay than at other satay stalls. The satays are very unique in its taste. You could sit in front of the Fatman Stall and apart from ordering satay, order any other food from the other stalls located both inside and from touts representing other food stall who move around from table to table.

Lau Pa Sat itself has got a very interesting atmosphere especially if you opt to sit outdoors next to the satay stalls. Do not sit too close to the satay stalls itself as it gets a bit smoky. As a local, I visit Lau Pa Sat at least 7-8 times a year just to soak in the atmosphere."
,,good food center,4.0,,There is a variety of food with reasonable prices.
,,"Satay, Mee Mamak etc",3.0,,Its open air dining with no frills just like the good old days. That is the road side dining area beside Lau Pa Sat. Lau Pa Sat itself is very busy during lunch time coz of the office crowds. There are few good stalls. The building is getting old and need refurbishing.
,,Just Good Food!,4.0,,"If you are in for anything satay - mutton, chicken, prawn, etc., this is haven! Food are freshly cooked satay style, tasty and affordable. We opted to eat out of the pavilion as it is quite humid inside, also best to eat here dinner time when its cooler. Add Teh Tarik or cold beer for your drinks! By the way, restrooms are terribly dirty so be prepared."
,,"Nice experience, not the best food",4.0,,"Hawker food wise it's not the best in Singapore (Maxwell is much better) but the ambiance and alfresco dining make up for it. After a long busy day it's always nice to sit out on the streets, have cheap Tiger beers and eat reasonable food. I love my satay but have been disappointed the last few times: too little meat and not well marinated as tested from various stalls. Eastcoast Park food centre still has the best satay. When I'm nearby I'll definitely go back but won't travel from afar just for the food. 3 stars for food, 4 stars for ambiance and location"
,,Satay time!,3.0,,Only place where you can eat satay by the roadside. Hope that this will be make a icon place of Singapore
,,Not the best Hawker Center,2.0,,"Unfortunately, is not the best Hawker Center in Singapore. We only came a few times, unless my friend come to Singapore wants to go there, we will. Not my first choice."
,,Atmosphere PLUS,4.0,,"If you want to go to experience a very wide selection of foods from across Asia, go to Lau Pa Sat.
If you go for your evening meal, sit outside on Satay Street, and enjoy Fat Man Satay....which comes with 30 satay sticks (chicken, beef and prawn) and a jug of beer...If you want to reserve a table and go and get some food...leave a packet of tissues on the table...its the signal that the table is reserved.

Great food, excellent atmosphere after dark, definately worth a visit."
,,Lunch,4.0,,"Convenience and choice. LPS is a quick fix solution for a 20 minute lunch. Thunder tea rice is by far my most frequented haunt. You'll hate it for the packets of tissue left behind to mark seats as ""taken"" and for the heat on a hot afternoon, but you won't complain if it sets you back less than 5 dollars for a good lunch"
,,Loved it,4.0,,"Huge range of food, locals and tourists alike, we had three meals here and no complaints, you get nagged a little bit but they leave you alone as soon as you say no thanks, not saying its the best food in Singapore but I think it's a great experience and there's something for everyone"
,,"food average, central but not special",3.0,,Very touristy and the quality of the hawker food is not good. the building is fine but could be more well maintained. if you want a more authentic experience go to Maxwell rd or Geylang for same quality of food
,,The most variety of food near CBD,4.0,,"This is the place where you could get the most variety of food near CBD of Singapore. Near to most workplaces or office buildings. Also, the place to go to eat satay."
,,budget meal at there,4.0,,very good place for have a dinner.coz not really expensive n the taste is good.u must try the satay.
,,Local flavour - literally.,5.0,,"I always take visitors to Singapore to this sprawling Victorian food market and invariably, when any of them return to Singapore, they want to revisit. It's an eclectic mix of food stalls representing a very wide range of principally Asian food but some Western offerings also. There is also an adjacent street which is closed to traffic in the evenings and hosts a large number of satay stalls. Ignore the annoying touts and sit anywhere you like. It's free seating so you're not obliged to patronise any nearby stalls. Don't feel obliged either to order anything from any menu which you're given. Just grab a table and have a good wander around until you find something which takes your fancy. There's beer and soft drinks on offer but no wine. I often take my own bottle of wine and no one bothers me. You'll need to pay to use the restrooms which are in serious need of renovation bot overall, an interesting and very reasonably priced, local culinary experience. There's even some live entertainment (band) on occasions."
,,Just another kopitiam located at business district,3.0,,"Atmosphere, not really good. Food mostly are mediocre."
,,Lunchtime Bliss,3.0,,"Lau Pa Sat offers variety, quality and value for money. You can eat delicacies from all over APAC and not have to move from this one place. All whilst enjoying a cold beer or a cold fresh squeezed juice!"
,,Give it a miss,1.0,,Lousy food and too touristry. Food are expensive and cleanliness can be very much improved. Many better places serving good food and at good price elsewhere such as Maxwell market.
,,a lot food t choose,5.0,,This is like a mercado but all the stalls selling food. There are a lot nice Singapore food stalls here. We tried the Sate and Crabs - the Hot Chili Crab
,,Lau Pa Sat - satay as far as the eye can see!,5.0,,"We've never seen so many food carts just selling satay. We finally picked one and had great beef and chicken with 3 peanut sauces. We also had the best made to order dim sum ever inside the wrought-iron market. A lot of fun eating small bites, drinking beer and people watching!"
,,Tourist trap all the way!,1.0,,"Do not go here. Everything is rideculously priced, if you look like a tourist! There are dozens over dozens of other food courts around the city where you can try genuine asian delicacies without being ripped off."
,,What I eat!,5.0,,Real singaporean food at affordable price.Get a taste of singapore here.
,,Lau pa sat - crowded,3.0,,Avoid weekday lunch timings. Try the satay along the side rd after 7pm
,,Satay Paradise,5.0,,"In the middle of the financial district you can find Lau Pa Sat, a lot of stands that sell different types of satay. Delicious, cheap and good ambiance. Always busy and definetely a place to visit."
,,Cheapest place for good quality fast food in Singapore,5.0,,"This is a 19th Century covered market with food stalls all around and tables in the middle - gets very busy at lunchtimes. Meals cost $3 - $6 dollars with plenty of choice. Great atmosphere with live music most nights, definitely somewhere to go for cheap but good quality food"
,,Lost some of the old historical feel.,3.0,,Still have plenty of food on offer. Plenty for a tourist to try but it has lost some of that historical feel already....
,,Good street food with live music,4.0,,"Granted it was a rainy Wednesday evening, but we wandered here last night for a quick bite to eat. There are various stalls around the centre, with a range of Asian food. We had Vietnamese, very good raw spring rolls (in rice paper), beef noodle soup and chicken stir fry. Cheap and cheerful and a trashy 80's band to amuse you."
,,Why is My Rating 'Terrible'?,1.0,,Lau Pa Sat had a great start when it first opened as a food center. Nice and spanking clean. Now it has degraded to being a slimy + smarmy hawker center that the poor sods working the CBD have no other choice but to go for a fast and not so cheap lunch. I also got food poisoning there.
,,Poor Pricing..,1.0,,Prices of food too expensive. The food portion is too little for the price.
,,Go somewhere else!,2.0,,"Compared to all the other hawker centers (food courts) in Singapore, this one an overpriced tourist trap where the food isn't even that great. The only real benefit is its location."
,,Dinner under the stars!,5.0,,"If we have out of town guests we always take them to Lau Pa Sat. We especially like the outdoor seating near the satay stalls, where the boys try to tout for business and seat you for satay, you can see the man making teh tarik, the satays being cooked and enjoy the outdoor eating experience as the road has been closed for the market. The prices are reasonable and the food is good. Enjoy wandering around to get a good look at what's available before you decide on anything."
,,Disappointing,3.0,,"Not worth the effort....just been to the hawker centres in Penang, Malaysia.....far superior"
,,satay,2.0,,Satay over there is just so so ..nothing special but a bit expensive as compare to other place that nicer and cheaper.
,,lots to offer but tourist central,3.0,,good but by singaporean standards (very high) no cigar! Newton hawker beats it hands down. having said that you shoudl try the satay on the side street and the seafood. may be overpriced by hawker standard but its very good
,,Historic Building,3.0,,There are some really good food stalls here. The Satay is good. The historic cast iron building is iconic. This used to be on the waterfront in Singapore
,,"Quick, cheap, good food",4.0,,"I have eaten at LPS many times and have tried perhaps 10 or more of the food stalls.
I tend to look for the ones where the food appears to be freshly cooked rather than looking like it has been sitting around a while. Overall, the place has a great vibe to it. It is a bit more relaxed there at night when the satay stalls set up on the side street.
I would suggest that you give this place a try. There is something there for everyone.
Great experience!"
,,Local Delights,3.0,,"""Lau Pa Sat"" is Hokkien (a Chinese dialect) for 'Old Market'.

Having been conserved and refurbished (with original architectural details retained), it now contains a multitude of stalls selling various local delights and cuisines, including the famous 'satay' (barbequed meat on sticks and dipped in peanut sauce).

In the evening, one of the side road is closed to traffic and becomes dotted with tables and stools. This allow visitors to enjoy al fresco dining under the night sky, right in the heart of the island."
,,lunch on the run,5.0,,"good choice, clean, efficient, friendly - with history"
,,Quite expensive but worth visiting,3.0,,"Along with Newton Circus, Lau Pa Sat is one of the more well known Hawker Centres. What differentiates Lau Pa Sat from other Hawker Centres are the many satay vendors that set up stall on one of the adjacent streets from around 7pm. The satay is very popular and the place can get packed.

My partner and I ordered the smallest quantity (20 sticks) of satay, for which we were charged around 35SGD which I thought was very expensive. The same product can be found in Chinatown for significantly less, 12 SGD for 20. Whilst Lau Pa Sat is an enjoyable experience, I think the satay stalls are an over priced tourist trap. The stall holders pounce upon you and they very quickly suggest things you should order, be careful as it's easy to get carried along by their suggestions and incur a hefty bill at the end.

Inside the main pavilion are many stalls offering seafood, noodles and so on which is more typical of a hawker centre. Whilst one hears of Netwon Circus, Lau Pa Sat and Maxwell Road Hawker Centres, many of the shopping centres have hawker centres, generally in the basement - these are less touristy and a meal can be had very cheaply. People's Park complex in Chinatown certainly has a very busy Hawker centre.

As noted above, it's interesting, fun and entertaining to eat satay - but it's at a price."
,,Fun Atmosphere,5.0,,"A bit touristy, but it has great satay that you can have on the street in the middle of the financial district! Beer is by the jug and King Satay (stall 7 & 8) are great!"
,,"If you like hawker stalls and satay, come here!",5.0,,"Amazing variety of different asiatic cuisine at hawker prces - ie v v cheap, especially for Singapore! Huge array of satay stalls in the evenings too."
,,Great night time atmosphere,5.0,,"Lau pasat is best enjoyed at night when you sit in the street outside and eat satay from the numerous satay stalls that appear at dusk. Mutton, beef or chicken satay and BBQ prawns are all delicious and I think this is an experience to be enjoyed by locals and tourists alike"
,,Lau Pa Sat: tasteless,1.0,,"There's a lot more to offer at other Singapore hawker's centres. Old Airport Road, Adam's Road, Maxwell road... in fact almost every hawker's centre has a famous/favourte stall(s). If a Singaporean is out looking for good hawker food. Lau Pa Sat is the last place he would think of going."
,,Crap food,1.0,,"Used to be a nice historical place with ""real"" food. Now, it's either a tourist haunt or a place for office workers to pick up food for the sole purpose of filling their stomach... Boo!"
,,An experience not to be missed,5.0,,"Satays, fried rice, cold beer etc open air market style food strip, right in the heart of the city, all watched over by the towering office buildings. Be enveloped by the smells and noise of satays cooked on mass. Lively and friendly stall owners, super fast service, great food."
,,Tourist-friendly but doesn’t feel too touristy,4.0,,"I will usually bring all Singapore visitors to this Hawker Centre, as the variety is much better than others (e.g. Newton Hawker Centre). It’s very tourist-friendly, but loads of locals make it feel less touristy. The Laksa stall is very good.

If there is a Chinese band playing on the centre stage it can be an interesting experience, but very loud so try not to sit near the giant speakers!

The value is excellent, and the stalls don’t seem to be charging any more than the less famous centers. Overall, I would recommend this place for anyone wanting to try local Singapore cuisine in an iconic building at good prices."
,,Great Satay and hawker food,4.0,,"Must visit place whilst in Singapore, especially to try the satay (available at night) along with other hawker food. Lots of variety of food in this open air place. The street outside the satay stalls (which are on the outside of the place and not inside the main pavilion) closes after 7pm into a street dining area which a nice vibe. Close to Raffles place MRT. Lunch is busy but quick turnover so should be able to get a table.
Talk a short 5 min walk after dinner to Marina Bay to sit by the water an enjoy the view of the Flyer, Marina Bay sands/casino and bay area which also had a light show (i think it starts on the hour)."
,,Great place to taste new foods,5.0,,This is a fabulous place for families to watch and try the cuisines of several countries under one open roof. Excellent satays for the picky eaters Picnic style tables Eating all day long
,,Nice sight seeing,4.0,,The sight seeing is nice. It is also a beautiful to snap photos.
,,Food Paradise,5.0,,This is an awesome place to enjoy the Singapore food - amazing variety and atmosphere. Go after dark for a vibrant atmosphere
,,No lack in varieties,4.0,,indoor and alfresco .... Dont visit this place during weekdays from 12pm to 2pm... Avoid lunch crowd.
,,Common hawker fare,4.0,,The signature dish served here is satay from the food kiosks along the road that operates from 7pm every night. The rest of the stalls serve common hawker fare available in most parts of Singapore heartland. The site is in Singapore CBD and it is worth a visit after a tour to Chinatown or Singapore River (Boat Quay or Empress Place) which are in the vicinity.
,,Good range of hawker food,4.0,,"Not bad, and not great, lau pa sat offers a wide variety of typical Malaysian/Singaporean hawker fare for a very reasonable/cheap price for Singapore standards (compared with dine in restaurants and shopping centre food).

My wife and I regularly ate there during our recent honeymoon as it was very conveniently located to our accommodation.

There are probably better hawker stalls around Singapore, but we went there due to proximity.

In the end, would we go there again? Yes! Would we like to try other places as well? Yes - but only if they're not too hard to get to. Would we go there again if he had to go a long way? Probably not, especially if there were more conveniently located hawker stalls."
,,"Hah, nothing gets better than this international place to eat n laugh!",5.0,,"You'll be spoilt for the international choices of food....there's every kinds of food under one roof for u to savour! Chinese, Malay, Indian, Western, Italian.....watever u name it u get it. Plus, there wld most often be Live music to entertain u or there'll be flea market or somekind of event on the weekends. Try it to believe me!"
,,Best hawker centre in SG,5.0,,"Great place for street food - although I think a lot of hardcore hawker fans would say it's ""commercial""! Satay street is just genius!"
,,"Oh, the shrimps at stall 7 and 8.... They are soooo good",4.0,,"Go sit outside, where they are BBQ'ing shrimps and satays. You can order all types of food, but definately order this one. Yes... It's a bit touristy and prices are a little higher than other foodcourts / hawker, but where else are you sitting between 60 story skyscrapers having a great meal"
,,"Good selection, but better options",3.0,,"There is a huge selection of food here, but it is also a tourist destination so the satay sellers are very overbearing. Go if you must, but I recommend Maxwell food center for a less annoying experience."
,,Plenty of Choices,5.0,,"Plenty of food choices to chose from... great prices, good for family or group of friends... I don't recommend for 2 or less people., the servings here are huge portion and are meant for sharing"
,,Great choice,5.0,,"This was an excellent introduction to hawker food . There was a wide choice as one would expect in Singapore. It was a""real"" eating experience with people popping in to grab something to eat after they finished work. We loved it."
,,Great Food,5.0,,Good open location and plenty of places to eat. Satay 7/8 are the best we found and service was very prompt.
,,Great Hawker's Stall area,5.0,,Great freshly cooked food and beer at good prices. How Singapore used to be and very lively.
,,Choose your time to go and watch for the birds!,3.0,,"At lunchtime, this is a very busy place, full of people working in the offices nearby enjoying a cheap lunch. It is loud, you have to queue and it is very difficult to find a seat.

In the evening, it has a very different character. They close the street beside Lau Pa Sat and set up the sate stalls there. The office workers are less in evidence and that is when visitors are best advised to go here.

As for the food choices, at lunchtime there are a lot of Indians who eat here and there are a lot of Indian food outlets to serve them. But there are many other cuisines represented and one I noticed today served very nice looking Philippine food. There are a couple of Italian outlets, plus of course a host of Malay and Indonesian ones.

Come here if you want a taste of many different cuisines at once, at a cheap price, in a quirky setting. Do not come here if you want haut cuisine. You can always find food prepared better somewhere else, but there is only one Lau Pa Sat.

One tip - be careful sitting under the trees both in daylight and after dark. Your reviewer had a nasty experience one lunchtime with a bird that dropped something unpleasant neatly on the top of his head. It may be considered lucky in some cultures, but it certainly will put you off your food!"
,,"Hot, humid and dirty",1.0,,"Pricey hawker food, mainly to con tourists. Why go there when there are plenty of cheap food courts in Singapore."
,,Hawker food & quirky building,5.0,,"The building was pre-constructed in Glasgow then shipped out to Singapore in 1894. Airy ceilings, lots of wrought iron, and plenty of fans to cool down the diners. Terrific hawker food - plenty of choice (we opted for Vietnamese), it was delicious and cheap. Nothing to dislike!"
,,"unclean, scary place",2.0,,"upon arrival, this place looks filthy and there is no clear halal and non halal section (as many other places in singapore). one guy keep on following us to wherever stalls we went."
,,Expensive Food,3.0,,Food was so-so yet overpriced. Go to east coast park for more variety of satay and yummier food.
,,Great variety of food!,4.0,,"From Indian cuisine to Satay, you can get almost everything at Lau Pa Sat. Try to avoid going during lunch due to it being in the CBD area, it will be very crowded."
,,Non-descript at Best.,2.0,,"Singapore boasts of more than 300 food markets/hawker center on a 700sq km island, so there are plenty of choices without having to go out of one way much. This food center is housed in a heritage Victorian-style building of 1890s vintage and enjoys much official publicity. But the set-up and quality of food overall do not do justice to the handsome building and its strategic location, it's at best a functional lunch option for people working in the vicinity and that is if one doesn't mind the almost sauna-like temperature and humidity.
I am afraid visitors who go to this food market hoping for a real and rewarding Singaporean Street Food experience would get a far from authentic and gastronomically satisfying one.
I would recommend, within the core downtown area, The Singapore Food Trail located at the Singapore Flyer(ferris wheel) complex for a much better quality street food meal if one doesn't have time or inclination to seek out the many good food/hawker centers in Singapore."
,,Quality of food,2.0,,Poor quality of food and cleanliness. Parking is terrible.
,,Convenient but disappointing,2.0,,Convenient but not the best place for local food in the CBD.
,,"My favorite place for a quick, decent but cheap meal",4.0,,"You have to first understand that this is a hawker center and not a 5 star restaurant. So don't expect white table linens, silverware and wine pairings.

That said, this place has a large selection of food stands selling India, Indonesian, Chinese, Filipino, Singaporean, Japanese, Korean and even western food. At night, the road next to it is closed down and it turns into an open area where people can eat amidst stands selling satay and other grilled items.

And with the food starting from SIN $4.50 to around $12.00 tops, you won't have to break the bank trying food from so many countries."
,,Expensive hawker centre,3.0,,I will never go there again. It looks like your typical hawker centre but the prices are way above what you would expect. Don't go unless you want to be cheated.
,,no peaceful meals,2.0,,"interestingly you will find yourself being tailed by a satay stall owner once you stepped into the pavilion,local or not. till you find a seat, a menu of satay and whatnots will be placed in front of you. Good thing is,they are not any different in prices,so you very much will get the same deal from any stall. The sad fact is,majority of the good food from the old Lau Pa Sat are all gone and vanished due to the increasing rental,lack of business,competition and various reasons through the years. Satays are palatable and a must-try to tourists, the only stall I would recommend is the local friend noodle called ""Char Kway Teow"". You will not miss it as it has the longest queue and the orders never stop."
,,Open air foodcourt with good satay.,4.0,,"Busy, open air foodcourt with all kinds of southeast Asian food. Especially the satay is very good. Not expensive, but be prepared for a noisy, busy experience!"
,,Hawker Centre in CBD,4.0,,Avoid the corporate lunch crowd during weekdays. 12-1.30pm
,,Food is good,3.0,,I don't really like the atmosphere but the food is good though.
,,Great Satay in Singapore,4.0,,"Get there after 7pm when they close a street and roll out the satay cookers, #7 is always very good"
,,Good Asian Food Market in old Victorian Structure,4.0,,"Great option for a cheap and cheerful asian lunch or dinner - every thing you can imagine: soups, dumplings, skewers, rice, curries, noodles, meat, seafood, fruit, juices in an old open-air Victorian market.

It is set in the business / financial district, I believe crossing Robinson Rd."
,,Lau Pa Sat is a Singapore culture experience,4.0,,"If you can order kopi-c at Kopitiam, Beef Rendang from the Indo food stall, tapas at the pinoy tapas king, BBQ stingray from the BBQ seafood stall, and of course Satay at midnight along Boon Tat Street (the street is barricaded and tables are put out for hundreds to enjoy satay every evening), then you have really tasted Singapore."
,,Authentic - BEST of all the hawker/food centers,5.0,,"go at lunch - it's crazy, but worth it. great food, tons of vendors. Love the old iron architecture of this building, way more character than any of the other food/hawker centers we went to."
,,"Try 4 cuisines in 1 meal, cheap",4.0,,"This is a place where you could have Cantonese dim sum, Indian curry, freshly blended tropical pineapple and papaya juice, and Singaporean seafood all in one meal. Prices were very reasonable. Walking distance from the Merlion and from the Raffles Place MRT station, Lau Pa Sat gave us a great taste of local life. (Note it is Raffles Place MRT station, which is not the same place as Raffles City Shopping Centre.) We tried a few hawkers' food markets during our 3 day stay in Singapore and this is definitely the most memorable culinary adventure."
,,"A sampling of the best Singapore food, under one roof",5.0,,"To most locals, the most exciting thing about Singapore is this multi-racial country's food. Dishes can be authentic Chinese, Malay or Indian, or even a fusion mix of all in a traditional dish that harks back to the country's earliest days.

For people who want a sampling of every local dish Singapore has to offer, Lau Pa Sat is the place to go. Even though not all the stalls here are the best in the country for their respective cuisines, the quality is good.

Among the must-try dishes here is Satay, marinated meat on skewers grilled over a charcoal flame. This traditional Malay dish is served with rice cakes and peanut sauce. The Satay Club, located on the right side of the building, boasts some 20 stalls and open in the evenings. The road next to these open-air grill stalls is closed for al-fresco dining. Most stalls will have assistants and wait staff ply the tables with menus - all of them deliver some of the best Satay in Singapore so buying from any stall should be fine.

Also try the grilled seafood, available at the stalls just next to the Satay Club. The grilled stingray fin, served topped with sambal, a local chili paste, is one of the most popular dishes. Also try out black pepper and chili crabs, two other signature Singaporean dishes.

For those who are less into seafood or meat, order Roti Prata, an Indian flatbread dish served with curry. The flatbread, which is served lightly pan-fried, can come with condiments wrapped in the dough. Popular Singaporean versions include mushrooms and cheese, onions, and egg. Go local by asking for a spoon of sugar to go with your prata. Dabbing a piece of prata into some sugar gives the savoury flatbread a slightly sweet taste that is popular with non-Indian locals and children.

This food heaven might be in the middle of the business district, but it is easily reachable by subway - simply take the MRT subway train to Raffles Place station. There are plenty of signs to lead you to the correct exit. Station staff are also knowledgeable and happy to offer directions."
,,On of the few Hawker places that has maintained his charm,4.0,,"This is one of the few Hawker center that has maintained his charm.
Centrally located, it offers a huge variety of local food and specialities.
From Indian vegetarian to Laksa, Noodles, Korean, .... You will wish you can eat more to try all the food.
Don't forget to bring a packet of tissues to book the table while you select your food.
(average price of meal around 4-5 SGD)"
,,Lots of Choice,4.0,,"Wander around the beautiful food market (especially at night) and be amazed at the choice of food. The street outside is good for satays while inside you can get wonderful fish, meat and vegetarian dishes, all at very reasonable prices. A great place for both locals and tourists."
,,Good fun and food,5.0,,Don't be pressured by the Touts have a look around there are lots of food options.
,,Great atmosphere and pretty good food,5.0,,"Do not be bullied by the touts take your time and look around before deciding what you want. Remember you can sit where ever you want. However, do remember if you sit outside a particular stall there is some expectation you will buy from there. Enjoy the experience"
,,One stop food shop,4.0,,Every kind of food from asia/ SE Asia available. Opens late nights too!
,,Best Satay in Singapore,3.0,,"Street market on the edge of the indoor hawker centre is worth the detour if satay is your thing. The street sellers are very very popular with the locals and as long as it is dry its worth a try. The indoor hawkers sell a variety of dishes so that all should go home satisfied.
Go early evening and then walk the short distance to watch the light show at Marina Bay."
,,We loved it.,5.0,,"We were impressed at first sight of this Pavilion. It reminded us of early Victorian architecture and the structure is fairly 'fussy'. It is showing a lot of wear and tear but you can imagine if it was all cleaned up and painted white it would look magnificant. For a cheap feed though, it was great.

There are so many stalls to choose from and the biggest problem is making a choice. It is all very casual, which makes it a relaxing experiance for a tourist.

I read a suggestion from a Singapore expert (tripadvisor) suggesting that you buy more than one dish so that you can get a better samplying.

We loved it so much we returned about four times during our stay at the Fullerton. We chanced upon the bbq satay on our last visit and it was perfection. We were supposed to share but hubby managed to get the lions share and he is normally quite civil when it comes to sharing.

The building is a part of history and I hope it remains for a long time."
,,Tradition,3.0,,Good choice of food... but nothing really stands out
,,Nostalgic,3.0,,This is one of the oldest food centre in Singapore and is located in the centre fo the Central Business District.
,,Love it.,4.0,,"The structure is in need of a good clean but the atmosphere is great. Of a lunch time be prepared to get here by 11.45 or you won't get a table. Seats and tables in Singapore are 'minded' by placing small packets of tissues on the tables so don't assume if you see an empty table that is available. If there are tissues on it, then someone has reserved it. The best bet is to leave a member of your party at the table. If you come of an evening (after 7pm) they close off the street at the back of Lau Pa Sat and sell satay - chicken, beef and mutton that comes with a compessed rice. The satay will be delivered to your table for you and a beer lady will come and take an order. If you are purchasing your food from one of the other stalls, then you have to wait for it and carry it back to your table yourself."
,,Frangrant Satay Street,3.0,,"We went to Lau Pa Sat for Satay in the evening. There are just many satay stalls but many are from same owners . We were told to go to number 7 and 9 and we discover they are from same owners.:)
The satays were great no doubt . However, they have become smaller in portion and more expensive than before.
We love the peanut sauce that goes with the satays as well as the Katupat.;)
We tried the nasi goreng from an Inidan stall at the end of the street and it was only so so. When it becomes commercialises, they lose the taste. People used to make food with loads of passion rather than money making. These days people just sell food for money and that erodes the quality of these cultural food.

Overall, it is a good experience if you are a visitor. The satays are also different from Indonesia or Bali or China so it is good to try."
,,Not worth a special stop but still quite good,3.0,,"If you are in the area, it's a good option, but I'm not sure it's worth a special stop. It's also possible that I didn't know the best things to order when I went. I had the chicken rice on one occasion and it seemed quite sub par compared to other chicken rice meals I've had here. I had carrot cake (black style) on another occasion and it was good. My husband had u-mian soup and he said it was okay. According to my Singaporean coworkers, the satay is the best option here. Next time I'll know better!

I love this place for the ambiance, however. The building is charming, albeit a bit run down. In the evening, a cheesy cover band sets up ON TOP of the central beverage stand. Well, I can't say that's true every evening. It was the case one night when I went!"
,,Great for lunches or late night snacks,4.0,,"LPS is one of the best hawker centres in Singapore, and you can get all sorts of food at any time of the day or night.
It gets super busy at lunch times, so go early or late to get a table. Thunder Tea Rice in street 2 is a favourite - filling and healthy. The hong kong dim sum stall seems to be open 24/7 - great for a late night snack after the bars/clubs.
Satay street (they close the road along the west side of LPS in the evening and fill it with tables and chairs) is good fun - cheap jugs of beer and a good variety of satay and other seafood and veg. You will get hassled to sit in a particular restaurant's spot, but take your time and just tell them no. It's illegal to tout so they will back off."
,,Decent eats,3.0,,A wide selection of food but not the best prices.
,,Singapore delight!,4.0,,Great Hocker style food. Huge variety to choose from. RIght doen in the financial district.
,,Dinner on the street,4.0,,"Spoilt for choices for food. Prices very affordable, yet difficult to find carpark."
,,Lau Pa Sat Review,3.0,,"Can be quite warm, especially during noon time as it is not air-conditioned."
,,Good place for Lunch,4.0,,"I've eaten at Lau Pa Sat countless times now. If you'd like to go for lunch its important to get there by 11:45am at the latest before the lunchtime crowd descend, then be prepared to have people hovering over your table waiting for you to go so they can take your seats. There is lots of variety here with a couple of really nice fruit and freshly squeezed juice stalls. If you come here for an evening meal be prepared to be hassled by the touts who want you to come to their satay stalls in the closed off street at the back of Lau Pa Sat. It's a great experience and far better in my opinion than the Maxwell Hawker Centre in Chinatown and Newton Circus. Good value for money."
,,Skip the chilli crab,4.0,,"The hawker market is great but we had chilli crab - unless the crab is huge, not much to eat. $25 wasted - should have got more satay or tandoori chicken"
,,casual dining with loads of variety,4.0,,"lau pa sat is near my house, it is in the CBD so very accessible
it was renovated a few years ago and has lots of small eating places under the one roof, hawker style. there is no airconditioning but overall it is pretty cheap to eat there, depending on what you order."
,,"nice buidling, but don't eat here!",3.0,,"the architecture is beautiful! but the food is terrible. the shanghainese food, 年糕隔夜的。 satay, burned ! 烧焦的怎么吃啦！ 辣椒螃蟹，也要30多块来，侧那不新鲜的，还不如去jumbo 来。 虾也不新鲜。 经济饭味道差。价格也不便宜。"
,,"Great food, lots of variety and cheap",4.0,,"Liked: Lots of variety and really cheap with an avg. price of about $5.

Disliked: Not much to dislike, but if you don't like eating in a hot humid environment with aromas of all kinds of food floating around, then this isn't the place for you."
,,Something for everyone,4.0,,This is a Singapore institution - the old wet dry markets have been both preserved and given a new lease of life. With so many food outlets there is something for everyone. The satays on the street outside with a beer are always satisfying.
,,touristy place,3.0,,"overpriced, but at laest there's decent food at the heart of town."
,,what a mess.,1.0,,"It saddens me that this is more known compared to than Maxwell Food Court, Lavender Food Square or Chomp Chomp.

In all honesty, Lau Pat Sat is a disgrace.

Unlike other authentic singapore hawker places like Lavender, Maxwell and Chomp Chomp - Lau Pat Sat is strewn with rubbish and visible dirt accumulated on it's beautiful frame.

The standard and variety of Lau pat sat's food is a gross misrepresentation of Singapore's yummy food culture. And the hygiene is horrible! (I have seen SO MANY RATS!)

It is a shame that the beautiful architecture is literally left to ruins by the current tenant. The awkward addition of drinks stall - and even a ""centre-stage"" made the place terribly cluttered - making Lau Pat Sat lose one of it's main beauty.

Lau Pat Sat is beautiful because you can STAND IN THE MIDDLE and admire all 8 directions of architecture - UNHINDERED by annoying ""new"" stalls. But this is lost - with the current tenant's bid to make more money out of the space - by adding these new stalls.

Btw, the singing by the band - is quite bad. really.

If you want a tourist trap - sure, check Lau pat sat out then.

If you are unfortunate to be led there by your tour captain - well, there are a few stalls that fares well with locals.

1) Char Kway Teow
This stall sells an array of delicious fried food - cook authentically with enough ""wok hei"" (breathe of the wok). Fried Carrot Cake (black or white. Gosh! the white was so good!), Fried Kway Teow (fried black sauce noodles with bits of seafood) - sinfully nice when it is piping hot. but it is really unhealthy and sinful. there is even a history behind all these dishes! but i dont want to spend too much time typing now.)

2) Fishball noodle stall - beside the Char Kway Teow stall. The soup stock gets better towards the night. And the fishball are nicely crunchy. This is the first fishball noodle stall I liked.

3) Cai Fan (towards the middle) Economy Rice Stall. Yes, this is manned by china man. Well, they are everywhere in Singapore (you cannot avoid them). But these chinese does not mess up. Some dishes are nice and yummy, but some are average. I will choose the long beans, silky-smooth steam eggs, and fried crispy honeyed pork. It is REALLY CRISPY! :)

Korean - I will give Manna Korean a miss. But head to the other stall. The dishes are flavourful with generous portions."
,,fantastic choice of food available,5.0,,stumbled across this place by accident and boy did we wish we were there for longer. Such a huge choice of food available and very popular with a real buzz atmosphere. We would have eaten here everynight. Amazing and can't wait to go back..
,,Best Food Court in Singapore,5.0,,This historic Victorian market/stalls is a must visit for any tourist in downtown CBD. Food options from all the World under a single roof. Many stalls open for 24 hrs. This is not at all a modern eatery but oozes aroma of Singapore since 1800s
,,Fun at the Hawker Centre,4.0,,Brilliant experience - tasty food at ridiculously low prices. Would definitely recommend it to anyone!
,,24 hrs,4.0,,"Great that this place is open 24 hours, always handy for a late night beer and a snack."
,,A fun food center with different lunch and dinner experiences,4.0,,"Lau Pa Sat hawker center is a busy lunch place for nearby office workers and a relaxing dining experience for both Singaporeans and tourists during the evening. All of the indoor stalls are open for the frenzied lunch crowd and the variety is enornous, from Chinese, Indian, and Malay offerings to Filipino, Japanese, Vietnamese, and Korean food stands. The satay stalls for which Lau Pa Sat is really known, are only open in the evening when the side street is closed down to accommodate the many satay vendors and their narrow charcoal barbeque stands. Some of the indoor stalls are also open in the evening so you have a wide choice of cuisines no matter what time you go there. The prices are very reasonable and you can have a great meal for around US$5-$7 with a beverage. Always ask the prices for the seafood hawkers near the satay stands as you could get a rude surprise, especially if they sense you are a tourist. At lunch time it may be hard to get a table for a large group but dinner will not be a problem as there is also the outdoor seating near the satay stalls and the inside is not that busy. They also have live music in the evenings."
,,Touristy,3.0,,"Well-located and has a wide variety of Singapore goodies.

Layout a bit confusing. Too may people. Pricey. Better take a train to any of the new towns and eat all you can, especially Bedok food court which is just off the MRT and bus staion, a few stations from the airport."
,,Better hawker centres in Singapore..,3.0,,"The place is known for its satay skewers and food, which is cooked on the outside streets. However, the inside of the centre sells an array of foods from different cuisines. This hawker centre is different to others in that the stalls make customers pay at the stall, and not when the food arrives at the table like other places. The prices are pretty much on par with other hawker centres, but the feel of the place is a bit dirty. Tables don't seem to be cleared very frequently, and the centre wasnt as packed as the other places visited."
,,poor value for local food.,1.0,,overpriced food. can get way better local food elsewhere
,,Nice satay eaten in the open air,3.0,,Nice satay in the evenings served at the side road which closes during the evenings. Rather hot and oil environment inside during the day.
,,A city lunch time necessity.,4.0,,"I work in one of the offices near by, so its a regular place to pick up my lunch. Nothing you can't get here. Indian, Chinese, Vietnamese - the lot. Highly recommend Thunder Tea Rice. Yum!"
,,Street food at its best,5.0,,"Cheap, tasty and buzzing... nuff said!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,,lacked flavour,2.0,,"since the revamp of the place, the place totally lost its feel. feels like a tourist market, more than a real hawker centre. the taste of the food sold there aren't authentic enough. and the prices are exorbitant."
,,Local delights,4.0,,Love the Satay and BBQ stingray.. many local delights available here - conveniently located near to Tanjong Pagar MRT.
,,Lau Pat Sat,4.0,,dine in historic building surrounded by modern skyscraper really pleasant.
,,Go for Satay!,4.0,,Go for the satay and beer after night fall. Order some bbq seafood as well.. relax & eat!
,,old school satay,4.0,,great experience in a classic food eatery. a must visit in singapore. wait until evening to see satay st in full effect
,,Dun even try.....,1.0,,"Thou variety is a lot, the quality is nt there. There is no quality control on the hawkers. Suggest to visit food republic which has popular dishes with better quality and also air condition."
,,Accessible for Visitors,3.0,,"Lau Pat Sa is an easy, accessible place to sample different S'porean cuisines under 1 roof. Yes, it's slightly touristy, but it's a one-stop shop for Singaporean food"
,,Not the place to head for if you are looking for delicious halal food,3.0,,"Lau Pa Sat Food Centre is huge with a variety of cuisines but halal stalls are limited. The ones that we tried were Indian stall selling rojak and mee goreng mama (fried noodles-indian style) Komala Villas' Bathura and the malay stall rice called Nasi Sambal Goreng, all kind of disappointing. The place is also not kids-friendly. If you must go to experience the atmosphere, then go in the evening instead (7pm onwards) to try the satay. The satay that we tried (only 2 stalls was opened at 2.00pm - was not that fantastic)

Regards,
mikahaziq"
,,Go for the satay's,3.0,,I went to Lau Pa Sat two years ago and sadly upon my recent return did not think it was very good. Half the stalls were not open and the meal I had was not enjoyable. It is not as good as it use to be. We started off the night with satay's outside which were great and still good value at 60 cents a stick. Wish I had stayed outside and stuck with the satay.
,,Awesome choice of Street food in Singapore,4.0,,"Singapore has to be a great destination just for its food on offer. Lau Pa Sat seems to be a historically reknowned place for a collection of so many food stalls offering a vast array of street food choices from interesting choices of chinese food (such as pigs organ soup etc) and halal malay food and indian curries etc. Located right in the middle of the corporate world of Singapore, I just happened to be there during the lunch hour so it was heaving of so many office workers and therefore struggled to relaxingly go through the vast choice of stalls and also to find a place to sit. Anyway I managed to find a shop selling grilled sting ray and had it. It was nice and interesting and very cheap. Then again I wish I had come at a quieter time (its my fault). So my tip is, its a definite must-go place in Singapore and avoid the corporate lunch hour and enjoy the food!"
,,Losing the old charm...,3.0,,"This place serves the typical hawker food usually found in Singapore. However, the place is losing it's charm slowly with more new stalls selling food from other countries. Fond memories of the old lau pat sat where they served no-frills cheap hawker food..."
,,Tourist trap,1.0,,Tourist trap for tourists or for office workers for a quick lunch. Hawker food has no quality. Go to Maxwell hawker centre instead
,,Overrated,2.0,,"Hot, humid, bug infested. Lots of rude hawkers. Overpriced for blah food. So many better options for food in Singapore, give this a miss."
,,The single most enjoyable place to eat in Singapore,5.0,,"After eating in nice middle and upmarket restaurants in Singapore, I thought that food is splendid but quite pricy even for hong kong standards.

But in the last evening we visited Lau Pa Sat. It was a revelation. The environment is unique, a colonial era market full of small eateries that serve everything from curry to satay, noodles to bbq meat. Locals and expats love the place that in the evenings takes over the small road at the south side of Lau Pa Sat and fills it with tables and stalls roasting shrimps, fish and red meat.

You just need to go around and order what makes your mouth watering most, make sure you have enough beer and meat on your tray and then enjoy the very lively atmosphere eating in a round table with friends and family. I recommend satay in any kind of meat and shrimps. Indian food is also very tasty and a good option for vegetarians. Fruit juices and desserts are also available though I cannot comment on them. Everything is cheap.

The only thing that put me a bit off was the public toilet that although you pay to enter, was in a very very very poor condition when I visited it."
,,We went and we left,2.0,,We had good experience with most of the food court in SIngapore but this one just off the mark. The choices were not there and the place was quite in the mess. Renovation was going on and we hope it gets better when it is done. We are Muslim and there were only one stall and it does not look clean at all.
,,A must do!,5.0,,We ate at this Hawker centre on our first evening in Singapore and it was the best food we had for the four days we were here. Great old Victorian building in the middle of the financial district. Don't be shy to go around all the different stall's ordering different food from each or you can just sit down and wait for them to come over to you. Try the Sate at stall number 8 it's the best!
,,Great Singapore Food Market,4.0,,"Great outdoor eating market filled with all the sensory delights that is truly Asia , but because it's in Singapore you can be confident the food is fresh and prepared hygenically . Great value for money , really good food and cold Tiger . Satays , chicken , beef , fish , crab etc"
,,Great Chilli Crab,4.0,,"This is a bustling hawker market with something to suit every taste and cultural requirement. I was craving chilli crab and found it here, not 5 star surrounds but a fun place to dine."
,,So many choices !!,5.0,,"We were given a tip to eat at Lau Pa Sat and it was spot on, the food was beautiful, there is something for everyone one there, very busy but worth the visit, will be going there again in March."
,,Not that good anymore,3.0,,"This place was known for inexpensive local ""hawker"" food, and it really was. But recently, it turns more like an iconic place of downtown Singapore with prices comparable to a mid-range restaurant... Besides, it is extremely crowded from 12om to 2pm, and it's pretty hot out there, especially at that time.
Food quality is the only thing they didn't spoil yet."
,,Do it - but avoid the lunch rush,5.0,,Has to be rated a Excellent because you have to see it in context. It's not a tourist place so what you are getting is legit local lunchtime dining for all the office workers. Cheap with heaps of variety and a little bit of atmosphere. If you can avoid the lunch rush then it will be a little easier making a selection from the variety without holding up the locals who have to get back to work.
,,"Overrated, very average, very hot, avoid lunchtimes",3.0,,"It's overrated to say the least - yeah it's a hawker centre but it's like any other hawker centre in Singapore. The place is crazy crowded during lunch time with office workers - I don't know how they do it because it's crazy hot as well. It's very hard to find a table during lunch time and the temperature soars way above 30 degrees when it's that crowded.

In the evenings, it's more quiet, it's a bit cooler and that's a much better time to visit.

I know there are some white people from cold countries who love the fact that Singapore is ridiculously hot during the day, but if you value your comfort and dislike sweating like a trooper, avoid this place in the day time."
,,Amazing variety at bargain prices in central Singapore,5.0,,"Lau Pa Sat is a Singapore institution near Raffles Place MRT, and a fantastic hawker centre for trying out a myriad of cusines. Some locals say the prices are high vs. other hakwer centres, but you still get a great dinner for SG$5 (!) right in the heart of the city, and the portion sizes are often much larger vs. the cheaper hawker centres. Far too many choices of types of food to list here, but you can certainly try out all the local classics (BBQ stingray/carrot cake/lime juice etc. etc.). Sure - it's not the healthiest, but just pick from some stalls that you fancy and enjoy an eclectic mix of flavours for dinner! Satay Street (Boon Tat Street) along-side Lau Pa Sat is also great for an evening of sharing Satay and jugs of beer with locals / tourists / expats, so don't miss that either!"
,,A nice hawker centre with lots of local foods,4.0,,"Went to Lau Pa Sat one night for dinner with colleagues during my recent business trip to Singapore in Oct 11. It was my first trip back to Singapore after 10 years and I remembered Lau Pa Sat from my last visit.
Some (locals) said to me Lau Pa Sat was geared more towards tourists and not so much for locals but as an Asian Australian myself I thoroughly enjoyed the food and the whole atmosphere. I am a vegetarian and could find a wide variety of dishes for my liking. My colleagues (also Asians living outside Asia) enjoyed their food. The location is great, only minutes walk from Raffles Place MRT Station. I would definitely return for another dinner if I travel to Singapore."
,,Variety at its best!,5.0,,"The food selection was just amazing. Don't forget to have some satay, they open up a street at night for all the satay stalls."
,,I might move to Singapore just to have lunch here every day,5.0,,"The hawker stall to end all hawker stalls, and it's in the same area as all of the major finance buildings. Several dozen stalls, offering you the best of what Asia can bring. A fantastic mix of Chicken Rice, Indian and Sugar Cane drinks. If you can't find anything to eat here, you're not human."
,,overrated much?,3.0,,"food are overpriced.not really tasty, there are more great hawker center out there in singapore,really."
,,A 'must do' experience,3.0,,"Lau Pa Sat, which I'm led to believe by a taxi driver means 'old market', makes it into many of the tourist guides. As such my initial inclination was to avoid it, but I'm glad I didn't. Set within a fabulous cast iron Victorian covered market, Lau Pa Sat is a diverse collection of stalls selling all types of asian cuisine. You wonder from stall to stall, buy what takes your fancy and then sit down at one of the communal tables to eat. I found myself eating something, then going to another stall and choosing something else, so it's less a meal more an extended snacking experience - although you can get fairly substantial plates of food.

Lau Pa Sat is an example of a hawkers' market. What it means is that you will be pressed by hawkers to buy food from them, they then go off to the stalls and get your food. I'm assuming they get some sort of commission from the stall owners. To be honest the hawkers when I was there did not seem too determined and a polite 'no' was always accepted. I suspect that the 'hawking' system survives because tourist are a bit timid about going up to the stalls and choosing. I found this a completely relaxed experience, some of the 'chefs' were very friendly and happy to chat whilst I stood and waited for my food, so it really does add to the experience.

I guess what Lau Pa Sat offers is a sanitised version of the asian street food market, and as such is less of a cultural shock to western visitors. That said it is still likely to prove a little challenging. It's not too tidy underfoot, mainly napkins and card, nothing more worrying. And in case you are worried about hygiene all the stands are regulated and must display a sign showing their level of cleanliness. 'A' is the highest rating. I ate at a 'B' and still ok eight hours later!

I went after a serious thunderstorm and it was noticeable that the customers were largely local. It wasn't too busy, but I can imagine it could get very busy, when communal tables won't just mean shared between all the stalls, but shared between the customers.

The food of course is amazing value, if you arrive by taxi this will probably cost more than your meal. It's fun food rather than great food, tasty enough but don't come looking for a culinary experience. The food probably won't make it into any recommended diet plan, but as long as you didn't live on it no great harm will befall you.

I saw beer and soft drinks for sale but didn't sample, so can't vouch for either.

There was a rock band playing when I was there to add to the 'atmosphere'.

I feel a bit mean giving it an 'average' rating, I'm pleased I went, would happily go again but I can't pretend it was one of my life food highlights. Tremendous though for all of that.

So all-in-all fun, frantic and filling, a 'safe' taster of eastern street markets, and amazing value. Definitely worth visiting, there's no real downside even if you don't feel it is your 'cup of tea'."
,,The best 20 Dollars I spent in Singapore,5.0,,"We loved this place. It is perhaps more accessible to tourists than some of the other hawker centres, but ultimately like all hawker centres you come here for one reason, great foods at cheap prices. Most meals are less than 5S$, even pigging out as I tend to do, you'll not spend more than 20-30S$. It does depend what stall you go to, but I tried 4 or 5 and all were great. You could pay 10 times the cost in a restaurant around the Bay, and you'd struggle to get a better meal!

As its in the CBD, its dead on Sunday. This can be a blessing (lots of tables free, no queues, less intimidating for a first timer) or a burden (less atmosphere, dampened sounds and sights and smells)"
,,Delicious and affordable!,5.0,,"What's not to like about hawker centres? This place has got some really whimsical architecture, and the food is tasty. Lots of options at very affordable prices. Check out the Maxwell Food Court in Chinatown for even more variety and a dose of all locals."
,,Try to beat the satay challenge at Stand 8,3.0,,"The satay at LPS is a little pricey but worth going for the experience. The satay stands are all outside the main building - you should be able to smell them. At stand 8 there is a satay challenge to eat as much satay as you can in 20 minutes. Last week, the record stood at 102 satay in 20 minutes - quite the tall tale but worth the try for those that are really big satay fans."
,,yummy satay,4.0,,"This century old icon at the heart of Singapore financial district is very popular with locals & tourists alike. During weekdays afternoon, this hawker centre is packed with office workers tucking into their favourite hawker dishes. In the evening, the makeshift roadside satay stalls open up. There is also a 'kopitiam' teh-tarik stall which attracts long queue. The stall helpers may seem to push u to settle down quickly but this little annoyance will soon be forgotten once the yummy satay comes. At $22 for 25 sticks that includes 5 sticks of prawns (plus the usual cubed ketupat, onions n cucumber), that was a pretty good deal indeed to chill out under the stars..."
,,Every satay is the Best Satay,4.0,,"We enjoyed a mixture of food but the best were the satay. We ordered from ""Best Satay #7"" (they are all called ""Best Satay""). The satay were drenched in oil to a point where we had oil running down our arms as we ate. The peanut sauce came hot (like it should) - almost boiling.

There was a live band and a nice cool and humid Singaporean breeze. Absolutely perfect to enjoy satay!"
,,Awesome Eats,5.0,,"Ate here twice on a recent trip to Singapore. At night they shut down an ajacent street and fill it with tables near the Satay Stands. It is packed with locals and has a great vibe. I ate myself into a coma on both occasions and stil didn't spend a fortune.

I ate Satay from stands 7&8 both times and found it to be excellent. Get the combo with Chicken, Beef, Mutton and Shrimp. The shrimp are expensive but very large and great tasting.

Although there are some stands touting, I found that a smile and ""No Thanks"" was all that was needed to get them to move along."
,,"Maybe the oldest, but not the best hawker centre",2.0,,"The hawker centre itself looks tired and it time to get a new look or touch up. As this is a steel structure with high ceiling, you could see that some places the ceiling is coated with black oil stains.
Many choices of foods here, but the taste is below average. You don't look forward coming to this place often, eventhough I lived nearby. Many of the hawker stores are being closed down, maybe because business not good as the majority of people patronising this place are those office working people around that area during the day. There are many choices for these people as there are few food courts nearby which are air-con. Lau Pa Sat is open air concept.
However, there is one particular Filippino hawker store which I liked and would eat if I happen to be at this place, is the one selling roast port and chicken. Roast pork belly was really good with their slightly sweet and sour sauce. Should try if you are there. It is near the minimart CHEERS."
,,way overpriced satay,2.0,,"15 sticks of satay for $20 SGD at one of the stalls was definitely way overpriced. The side dish veggie at $6 was tooo.

only saving grace was the fantastic peanut sauce....

i suggest saving your pennies....booking a trip to KL....then taste the satay there....friendlier...tastier.....less pushy ....all round better experience...."
,,Convenient Lunch near Marina Bay,5.0,,"While I hate Food Courts in America, I loved the Hawker stands in Singapore. This is the real fast food of the world, not that junk food you get in the malls of America.

Fresh hot lunches, yes I ate HOT soup in 89 degree weather, quick and for not much more then $7. I was totally overwhelmed by the choices however. I love Asian foods but am not entirely an expert on what is what. I just know I love it!

The two times I was here I tried: chicken congee with a vinegar egg [brown looking thing] on the side and Indonesian chicken satay with some veggie sides.

I could eat here every day, and it looks like most office workers do. The place was packed to the gills so finding a seat can be a challenge. A trick I learned was that people reserve their chair with a kleenex packet. Funniest thing - in the states, someone would think it was left behind. Not to mention, you need those packets of kleenexes because you don't usually get napkins anywhere. So when you see a gentlemen in a wheelchair selling those packets, buy one!"
,,Local Food,5.0,,"Its hot, but the food made it all worth it! I had satay with peanut suace and it was amazing!!!!"
,,A Must Try!,5.0,,"The oldest food center in town. Good atmosphere and some excellent food.
Lots of tourists, and locals, and some very aggressive hawkers - but a fun time with great food, and great variety.
The stingray and satay are perhaps most famous, but so many tasty treats to try. Have been here several times, and look forward to returning.
Just ignore the hawkers and their menus. Locals recommend the satay just near the stairs to the main seating area (shops #1, 8?). Someone will offer to bring you beer - same price as anywhere else, so relax and let them deliver.
Do look around and try something new, excellent deserts etc, but concentrate on satay, seafood and some basic dishes. Enjoy the adventure!
Gets crowded late night after the bar scene, and it's not a long walk to the river or Chinatown."
,,Try everything!,5.0,,"One of the best eating experiences I had in Asia. The building alone is worth a visit, but the real star is the food, you can get basically every Asian cuisine you can think of. You can sit inside or outside, both places have their advantages (different live music, food places (Satay only outside), atmosphere), we just moved from one table to another after some time. The biggest plus point for Lau Pa Sat is its above average hygiene rules, it's the only hawker center in Asia where I really dared to try anything I saw! And that is just fun and makes for a great evening!"
,,"Not the best, but worth a try",3.0,,"Lau Pasat isn't the best food centre you could have, but it definitely the most famous in Singapore. Lots and lots of options of cuisines around the world. Satay stalls are open at night. You can expect a wide array of options here, but don't expect too much on the taste."
,,My Favorite Hawker Center (Food Court) in Singapore,5.0,,"A lot of choices of Asian cuisine and street food that taste beautiful and relatively cheap for Singapore standard (around 5 SGD per meal). Fresh fruit/juice also available in reasonable price. You can enjoy tasty satay at night as well.

The building itself is round and have classic Singapore architecture. This place is one of the oldest hawker center in Singapore. No air con here but the temperature is just right, not too hot.

Avoid having lunch in weekdays here, since most worker around this area having their lunch here (incl. me ^^). It will be difficult to find a table. If you insist to go, bring packs of tissue with you to 'chop' (= secure) your table while you ordering your food.

If you come from outside Asia, I really recommend this place to you."
,,Cheap food and great taste,4.0,,"Lau Pa Sat is an outdoor eating market. All asian food available the chilli crab is fabulous. Cost is around $20.00 AU and well worth it, this is for the whole crab you choose they cook. You can also choose the amount of spice you like Very subtle to extra hot, the hotter the better. They also have great singapore satay 12 sticks mixed beef, mutton and chicken for about $5.00 AU. Opens at 4.00pm and gets very busy at around 8pm. Beers $4.00 AU which is good for singapore. A short cab ride from any hotel in Singapore. Close to Marina Bay,"
,,went to the stall with the longest line,4.0,,"We were overwhelmed by the large number of stalls so we went to the stalls with the longest lines. I had the noodles where you pick out some veggies, fish cakes, and other things I wasn't sure of... you get a choice of broth. It was delicious. My husband had the chicken with rice which I loved but he gave his 3 star and I gave my meal 5.. hence we averaged out to 4 ! I had the sugar cane juice which was delicious (went to Newton Mkt and ordered the same drink and got really sick). Next time to Singapore, I'll stick to bottled drinks."
,,EXCELLENT SELECTION OF FOOD,5.0,,"If you're looking for a down to earth and unpretentious eating experience then Lau Pa Sat is the place for you. There are numerous food stalls from various ethnic backgrounds available. Most stalls only make half a dozen or so dishes, something which they have made and perfected over many years so they often taste far better than any fine dining or fancy restaurant can make. Just a few words of advice - don't worry about several different people eating at your table, this is normal - you can order food and drink from numerous people and different food stalls, you're not obliged to eat from one particular stall once you've ordered and finally you have to be assertive with the ""touters"" if you're not they will hound you all around the food center. Lau Pa Sat is a must see and experience when visiting Singapore. Highly recommended"
,,Great place for good cheap food.,4.0,,"Originally fabricated in Glasgow and sent to Singapore in parts to be assembled, this gem of colonial architecture is home to one of the better Hawker Markets in Singapore. A place to find a wide range of good asian food, at very good prices, we visited here more than once on our short trip to Singapore."
,,may be visited; atleast once,4.0,,walking distance from merlion park all typesof food for all ages are here satay's are good but the beef are gummy from satay 8 wendys for kids the teh tarik from the cart is the best i tried ever in sg
,,Good place for satay,3.0,,"Renovated place for food stalls. Many satay shops to choose. Satat taste good, worth to go"
,,Try it if you like different varieties of food,5.0,,"I had been there many many times....... I always loved it. The place has the best Satay available in probably the whole of Asia. There is a lot of competition among the Satay vendors and so the quality is good.

There are a lot of different varieties of food - Ice Kachang and other deserts, Fish & Chips, South & North Indian. A lot of seafood and Chinese cuisine."
,,Great satay experience,4.0,,"Used to eat at the Satay Club in Clarke Quay but looks like most of that action has moved here now. Really nice Colonial architecture with a vast choice of options. We got followed all around the market by two food traders which was annoying, but they moved away when asked.

Just so that you know how this works...as we didn't...you order everything from different people e.g. one person/stall for satay, one for rice, one for bread, one for beers and drinks etc. So be prepared for a number of people coming up to you with menus which can be confusing - and make sure that you have plenty of small notes to pay the various people.

Once you know how it works that it really does, like clockwork, stuff just keeps turning up until you have everything you ordered. We ordered a selection of beef, chicken and king prawn with rice and it was yummy. You can order as many times as you like until you've had enough.

We had to wait a little while to get a taxi back to our hotel as for some reason they did not want to go to Chinatown but other than that was fun and tasty experience!"
,,Lousy beer and burnt satay,1.0,,"We are not fans of touristy eating places in Singapore, but we decided to have supper there this week. I ordered a beer and was presented with a glass often flat beer. I pointed this out to the waitress Auntie and she argued that it's good beer. That pissed me off. I made it clear that the beer was lousy, but paid for it to avoid making a scene for the company I was in. Later, much later, the satay arrived, mostly burnt. We ate what we could. The beer was flat and the satay was burnt, and we paid more than we would at other eateries. This is one of the best known eating spots in Singapore. Go figure!"
,,SUPERB!,4.0,,"We dined at the open area and had kangkong sambal, mixed satays and yang chow fried rice. The kangkong sambal was really the best! The satays were small but what the heck, i had 15! Will be going back to Lau Pa Sat upon my return to SG."
,,Outdoor hawker centre with atmosphere - satays were delicious,4.0,,"We were originally going to go to Newton Circus but the hotel concierge advised that it is now very touristy and very expensive as they only serve seafood. He suggested Lau Pa Sat.

Lau Pa Sat is just past the Chinatown area, set admist the gorgeous, modern buildings of the business district. I really enjoyed the surround architecture and the food.

Around 7pm or so, they close off part of the street near Lau Pa Sat and they set up tables and chairs alongside the satay stalls. I really enjoyed the outdoors atmosphere and balmy night.

The food was good but we didn't know which of the many shops to choose so I think we could have done better. The satays at 'The Best Satay Stall 8' were delicious. You get 20 sticks of satay (beef/chicken or mutton) all for $12. It comes with 2 bowls of extra dipping satay sauce, onion and cucumber but unfortunately, no sticky rice.

The chicken rice was good too but I think a bit more expensive that what we paid for at Chinatown ($5.80) Food at Chinatown was dirt cheap. You can order a plate of rice with 1 or 2 meats choices with 1 or 2 veggie choices for $3-$4.!

Singapore is food heaven because of the cleanliness standards. Each establishment must show their rating, eg. rating ""A"" is the top cleanliness standard and then B, C etc. It's a great way to know and we never got sick from eating in Singapore. Just got to go on that diet now....

p.s. make sure you go to the toilet before heading out to Lau Pa Sat as they are quite dirty and smelly, quite unusual for Singapore."
,,Good experience for a variety of food,4.0,,"We went to Singapore for the summer and our office and apartment was very near Lau Pa Sat so we dined here frequently. There is a good variety of foods and as others mentioned there is satay at night. We loved the ice Kachang here!! Also, one thing to note is that each station has a grade behind it that they have been given based on the cleanliness scale. This is clearly posted for you to view. There was a lot of construction going on when we were there but overall the building is beautiful and the food is decent and priced well."
,,No Better Place To Try Everything,5.0,,"I can think of no better place to visit to try every cuisine at once: Indonesian, Malaysian, Chinese (break it down by region, and they've still got it covered), Indian (same), Singaporean...you can even get a burger if you really want. But with all the wonderful food around you, you'll actually be hard pressed to be temped by junk food."
,,Brilliant food in a great atmosphere,5.0,,"This is a brilliant up to date hawker stalls that is typical of Singapore. The main seating area and hawker stalls are housed in an old undercover market which sets a nice scene to eat by.

Here you can find the best satay around from the numerous satay stall down one end of the seating area. All the food I've eaten here as been brilliant (stall all holding an A rating) and of course the Tiger is always plentiful and cold.

The last time I went (and yes there have been many) they had even added live music in the center."
,,Good and Bad are close,3.0,,"I've been many times to Singapore and Lau Pa Sat, or ""old market"" has always been one of my favorite eating places. I like sitting here, servers are bringing food and drinks and you have so many different choises then in very few other places in town. But there is also a drawback: as Newton (another Hawker centre) this place is a real tourist place. Means, food is not that exceptional as in some other good hawker centres and it is quite expensive for the quality. Still I can recommend it to people who are just staying a few days and want to try out Hawker food. And easting is really great when you pic the right table - so walk around and look for the nicest seat."
,,A famous food court with extensive selections,4.0,,"If you can't find something you like here, you're too picky! A famous food court, Lau Pa Sat (there is no ""r"" in the name), has dozens of stalls with a wide variety of food. Because this is slightly 'upscale' (VERY slightly), it may be more comfortable for tourists with a bit more private space at tables and a slightly cleaner atmosphere.
Otherwise, Lau Pa Sat is really just a bigger version of the food hawker courts that dot Singapore. If you're visiting for the first or second time, this is a good way to get your feet wet in how a food court works. I wouldn't really go out of my way to re-visit this, but I will admit that they have a wider variety of food sellers than many of the smaller food courts do.
A good choice, especially if you're already in the neighborhood!"
,,Fabulous eatery,4.0,,"I have been here many times on my trips to Singapore. You have to avoid the 'touters' and choose what you want to eat from a variety of stalls. As soon as you arrive, someone will guide you to a table. Fantastic atmosphere and delicious local food, not bad value for money."
