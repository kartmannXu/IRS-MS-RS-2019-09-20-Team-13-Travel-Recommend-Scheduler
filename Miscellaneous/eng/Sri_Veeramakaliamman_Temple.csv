As with all Indian temples you need to leave your shoes outside and fortunately there are lots and lots of shelving to place your shoes. The entrance of the temple has two very large wooden doors with big metal studs all over it. The grounds of the temple are not that large but with many colourful statues and you will see lots of people praying here.The temple is quite abuzz with activity and you are freely allowed to wander around inside taking photos.

I actually have found that many Hindu temples are really big but this one is a good size for tourists such as myself to visit and therefore quite busy and certainly a good example of a beautiful Hindu temple. It is well worth the visit when in Little India."

As it is a very big tourist attraction the shoe station at the front along with lots of western signage takes away from the awe of this place but it is still worth the visit.
Make sure you remember to take your shoes off before entering.
Upon entering it is even more beautiful with all the stations located throughout the temple of the gods and the architecture is stunning.

,,Awesome,4.0,,"The Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple on Serangoon Road in Little India is an awesome temple.

The temple was quite busy with worshippers at the time of my visit. i was amazed by the ornate sculptures on display. There was a strong smell of burning incense.

This is a place of worship, and you need to take your shoes off when you enter the temple.

It is reputed to be one of the oldest temples in Singapore. It is beautifully decorated with statues of Hindu Gods. I guess most had a coating of gold coloured paint.

The priests were saying prayers and then sprinkling the worshippers with holy water.

This temple is worth a visit."
,,One Incredible piece of Architecture,4.0,,"If you visit Little India in Singapore(which is a must), you should find some time to visit this beautiful and always busy temple.

It is a great experience (even if you are a non-believer)"
,,amazing gopuram (roof),5.0,,"This is one of Singapore's oldest temples, built in the Dravidian style by early migrants. The sculptures at this temple are really amazing. Amazing, too, is the friendly welcome from the priests and parishioners. When you consider that they host, probably, 100+ visitors a day but they remain pleasant. Just meet them half way and take off your shoes and socks and try to be inobtrusive. I was there during prayers in the afternoon and stood in the back, near the door, with a shawl over my shoulders, just enjoying the music, chats, etc. They even blew a conch shell. As things progressed, a priest sprinkled parishioners near the main altar with holy water. Then he moved along among people in the middle of the room, sprinkling more and more people. Then he spotted me at the very back and detoured over to sprinkle me, too. How friendly and welcoming is that!"
,,Decorated Temple,4.0,,It's a higly decorated temple with many paintings and statues of Hindu dieties. I had the chance to visit the temple during a ceremony and they had no problems with that. Just don't forget to remove your shoes.

southern part of Singapore. As with most Hindu temples you will need to take off your shoes (leaving them at the entrance), take off any hats and cover bare shoulders and legs (there are wraps available to use at the entrance).

The temple, built in 1881, is one of the oldest in the City and is dedicated to the Hindu goddess Kali. Images of Kali throughout the temple show her wearing a garland of skulls and ripping out the insides of her victims but are counter balanced with motherly images of her with her sons; Ganesha and Murugan.

As i visited on a Sunday it was crowded, noisy, colourful and vibrant all of which I’ve learnt to expect after visiting many Hindu temples in India. If you’ve never been to a Hindu temple then this is an experience that is worth trying."
,,Unique,4.0,,this kuil so unique.. free entrance fee and we have to remove the shoes.. inside there is like donation (but not sure what is).. so much statues inside and we can see how they pray..

We were provided with the necessary clothes to cover up, free of charge and removed our shoes. The temple was very busy with worshippers and there were lots of different shrines (hope this is the right term). It was hard to know where to look as there was so much to take in and so many beautiful statues and artefacts. It's one of those places that it's hard to describe for the sheer beauty - very worth the visit to get a flavour of the local culture."
,,Amazing look into Hindu temple,5.0,,You may go inside they welcome guests as long as you take your shoes off. Once inside you will be over come by the colors and statues. This place is beautiful. We had a guide with us who could tell us what we were seeing. Great experience and free too!! Three or four steps not really wheelchair accessible.
,,Interesting details,4.0,,"Very colorful and the details on the roof are outstanding. It's not as interesting from inside so if you are in a hurry, just skip going inside."
,,Temple in Little India,3.0,,"Dedicated to Kali, here is the most interesting entrance door with many figures. To get inside you have to leave your shoes outside."
,,Amazing carvings,5.0,,"Perhaps because it was Deepavali/Diwali and the place was really bustling, or may be because we had already visited some the temples, but the Sri Veeramakalimman was the temple I enjoyed the most. After looking at photos online it appears a little underwhelming when you first see it, but pause for a while and take in the intricate carvings of Hindu gods - they’re all over the temple, inside and out.

Visitors are asked to behave respectfully, go barefoot, and cover shoulders and knees - there are shawls and clothing to borrow if you need them.

The whole area of shops in Little India leading to the temple is also well worth exploring."
,,Full of Energy,5.0,,As we made our way to Bugis after shopping in the Mustafa Centre we came to this temple and as is the custom we removed our sandals and ventured inside. There is a constant energy from the priests as prayers are said and gifts presented. Some magnificent shrines and well worth the visit.
,,Spectacular temple,5.0,,"This is a must-see in Little India, a temple covered in the most amazing carving and figurines. It is an important temple and shrine not a tourist attraction so discretion is needed when entering. Shoes and socks must be removed and feet can be washed in the outside sink area. Women must cover shoulders and knees so make sure you have a wrap with you and wear a longer skirt or trousers. They will lend you clothing if you are not suitably attired.
We watched a line of worshippers being tended by a temple official ( sorry don't know the correct term for them!) and also saw (and nearly felt) a man smashing a coconut into a pit to bring relief from illness. Very educational."
,,Beautiful carvings,4.0,,Amazing temple in little india (be careful as there is another with a similar name we went to by accident!) The carvings are amazing and truly unique. Great place to visit and have some quiet time.
,,Beautiful temple in Little India,5.0,,This is a beautiful temple in Little India and we removed our shoes and had a look around as our timing was good. Not always accessible. Worth a look.

,,Temple in heart of Little India,4.0,,This legendary temple is in heart of Little India at Serangoon Road. Very beautiful architecture and is always crowded with people.
,,The oldest and most beautiful temple in Singapore,4.0,,"This is first and foremost a place of Hindu worship so visitors should be aware that respect should be given at all times while visiting. All foot coverings need to be removed at the front door, and you must dress appropriately to enter. Inside the smell of incense is almost overwhelming, but you know that this is in keeping with the religious rites being performed and observed inside. There are various stations within the temple where praise for the particular God is being performed. Each station is beautifully presented with rich colours, gold, silver and platinum adornments. Outside the temple is the most amazing display of colour and statues festooned across the roof. Worth a visit and spending time in quiet contemplation."
,,An amazing Experience,4.0,,We loved walking around this temple and didn't manage to make it to many others while in Singapore. If you want a map of the temples then find them placed at the entrance of every temple.
,,Unique,4.0,,"This was a drive By on the Hop On Hop Off bus tour. It is a cool and unique monument, and be ready to remove shoes to go in."
,,Beautiful and interesting,5.0,,"The detail outside is just amazing and so colorful. Definitely worth lots of photos. I took some from the other side of the road.The inside was just as beautiful. The local people were so helpful letting us to go forward to watch the many ceremonies going on. They were amazing.The relics are beautiful and well looked after. We did not understand all the ceremonies but nobody stopped you and moved you on. So you absorb the atmosphere It would have been good for some information about the ceremonies It was also ok to take photos inside.
Just take off your shoes outside and dress respectably I would certainly visit again ."
,,Cultural Experience,5.0,,First time for us in a Hindu temple. Many people praying and worshipping. Many displays of the different deities. Beautiful.
,,Curious place,4.0,,Nice temple and easy to find. Is ok if you are in the area... but not a “must”. It is better outside than inside
,,Beautiful and powerful Temple,5.0,,"I am writing this from an outsider’s POV - although I am a Hindu and this is one of the Temples i frequently go to pray.

For many tourist, this temple tends to be a key place to visit as it is situated in the middle of little India. You just can’t miss it. Many tourist I believe love the bright colors of the temple and they are pretty astonished to see the rituals taking place. For some, this may be their first time seeing such things.

I believe more can be done to inform visitors and tourist of the rules, regulations (e.g. type of clothing, no footwear), purpose of the rituals, prayer times and so forth. There are genuinely many of them interested to know about others religion and culture.

The temple tends to get crowded on Fridays and weekends, and navigating inside the temple may be difficult from time to time during this time.

*As for Hindus, I believe the Durga in this temple is one of the most powerful. If you believe in her, pray to her, pour your heart out and she will be definitely listen."
,,Awesome Temple,5.0,,"Awesome Temple, very beautiful, and very much welcoming of visitors of other faiths or nationality, as long as you remove foot wear, can be crowded but still so peaceful, and so fascinating to see and learn a little bit about Hindi. One of the oldest Hindi Temples in Singapore."
,,Lovely Temple ...,5.0,,"We were in Little India for Deepvali and we wanted to visit the Temple, as we usually do when in the area. I find that no matter how busy it is in here, there is a really peaceful spiritual atmosphere, that is calming and mentally rejuvenating.

Everyone is welcome to enter, regardless of creed or nationality, as long as you are modestly dressed and remove your footwear. Please do visit, it's a beautiful and fascinating Temple and well worth visiting at least once."
,,An Amazing Temple,4.0,,We visited when Deepvali was being celebrated. An amazing spectacle. The Temple itself is so ornate and beautiful. But I would suggest visiting when there is not any celebrations happening and you can appreciate it fully.
,,Visited during Deepavali,5.0,,"Nice temple, few minutes walk from Little India MRT station, very crowded at night, quite a popular attraction."
,,Beautiful holi place,5.0,,Another must-go place in spore. Religious place and those who visit little india shall visit this temple too. There are two temple along serangoon road.
,,Temple in Little India,4.0,,"This temple in the heart of Singapore's Little India has amazingly ornate sculptural details, especially above the grand entrance. The beings/deities and their vibrant colors are definitely worth a look."
,,Memorable Hindu Temple in Little India,4.0,,"I am quite glad that I went and saw this Temple. It is a Hindu Temple which had been there for 100+ years when it was demolished in the mid-1980's and redone entirely over a three year period.

This is an active vibrant Temple, where there are more locals worshipping than tourists, but where tourists are welcome in most parts of the Temple also. There is a great front facade with three dimensional figures which are representations of a wide variety of deities. There are also many small other side places to worship each with its own unique meaning.

I enjoyed the vibrancy of the Temple even though I did not understand some of it until I read about it online. Still, it was worth taking in the essence of a true Temple in the middle of a vibrant neighborhood where the Temple is the center of the spiritual and neighborhood life nearby. Many many families there, they served dinner to the congregants also.

Note, that this place is closed each afternoon for several hours, currently between 12:30pm to 4:00pm, so no access then. I went around 6pm so that I could see the place in daylight, in dusk, and then at night. The street scene is also worth checking out after dark too.

,,Breath taking!,5.0,,"Had a recent trip in Singapore to visit my sister who is based there. My husband and I really enjoyed walking within this area. It has a deep culture history behind it and the architecture was really amazing. If you're visiting Singapore, make sure to visit the temples.

This temple is located in the corner of the street and could be crowded."
,,Temple dedicated to Kali,4.0,,"Very nice Hindu temple dedicated to Kali. Check out the many shrines both inside and outside.

,,Bustling Temple,4.0,,"So many people coming and going! It was out first temple and as such, probably made a large impression on us. This one had a lot going on that as a non-worshipper I had no clue about. I remained as unobtrusive as possible and said a few prayers of my own. I must admit there was some kind of energy here that moved me to tears. Such devotion!"

After having darshan, one can take the free prasad consisting of Kesari Sheera and puliogere rice."
,,A great place to witness 'religion' in every way.,5.0,,"The first thing that struck me about this temple was the ornate decorative features inside and out. This was soon overtaken by the complete reverence shown by worshippers and visitors that this temple commanded. It was truly amazing. Inside you can witness blessings, offerings and other traditions being carried out. There are various shrines positioned throughout the complex each with its own special meaning and the locals were happy to explain things. I visited quite a few times at various hours of the day . I was surprised at how many people went there for blessings etc. on their way to work in the mornings and from then on there were always patrons, sometimes crowded but that just added to the experience. One word of warning, when you visit you need to take your footwear off outside and as there may be literally hundreds of shoes there just make sure to remember in what position you left yours. On most occasions I went there was an elderly man seated outside, whom many worshippers acknowledged. I spoke with him on several occasions at length and he was fascinating to listen to as he gave great insights into religion generally and what was taking place at this temple specifically. A couple of times I visited there was a group at the back of the temple giving food/meals to worshippers and visitors alike. I understand this too was done as a form of honouring the beliefs."
,,A noisy and inconsiderate temple,1.0,,Drums beating and trumpets flaring. Bells ringing and clanging. The high decibel is on par with a jackhammer. You wouldn't want to risk your ear drum bursting to step inside the arena. The temple could have make soothing music instead of pure noise to appease the angry Kali god. Definitely not recommended.
,,Hindu temple in town.,4.0,,A little temple in little India. Inside it looks 'exactly' like you are in India. The temple was quite busy on the day we walked in.

,,Attention to detail,3.0,,"This is a lovely temple to walk past as you walk down Serangoon road. But I wouldn't go out of your way, unless you are going to go in. It is intricate, and in the heart of Little India. There are shops close by too."

,,A nice temple to visit,3.0,,It's a nice temple to visit. The art and sculptures are certainly a sight to behold. But not much else to do here.
,,Beautiful temple,4.0,,"We visited during a religious festival and everyone was even more enthusiastic to include outsiders. They were walking a circuit with a variety of difficulties - bed of nails anyone? It was really nice to see how much support they were given by the locals. The building itself is exquisitely decorated, definitely worth some time when in Little India."
,,Beautiful Temple,4.0,,"This temple is a must see if you are near Little India. Although I was short on time and did not go inside, the exterior architecture is amazing! Everything is so ornate and it is kept in better shape than other temples that I have seen during my visit to Singapore !"
,,Chaotic and fascinating!,4.0,,"We'd just visited the Jamae Chulia Mosque, where all is peaceful, tidy and orderly, and then went to the Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple which is the complete opposite ... Busy, noisy, chaotic and bursting with people and colour. There are loads of photo opportunities here, but keep your camera hidden until you're past the people at the entrance or you'll be asked to pay a cheeky licence for your camera. So much colour and sofa many effigies, but no explanation easily available as to what they all represent. We'd have loved to learn more about the religion and practices, but there was no one there to ask. We may well have been there at a particularly busy time though, as people were queuing to see the priests and for food."
,,Another beautiful sight,4.0,,"This temple is incredible, much like the mosque in the arabic area. You can stand out side and study the figures for hours before thinking of entering. Sagrada Familia in Barcelona may be a worthy competitor when it comes to the exterior but to me this is much nicer, even if I love the art and style of Gaudi."
,,Well used and busy temple,4.0,,"We visited at about 8pm when the temple had plenty of families using the place. Removing your shoes, I was feeling very comfortable to wander round on my own, with amazing and colourful decoration all around. There was a singer chanting and many people praying to the gods in the different sections of the temple. As with most temples, food was being given at the back to those who queued for it."
,,Colorful and friendly.,5.0,,"This multicolored temple on Serangoon road is covered from top to bottom with idols of the Hindu pantheon and always bustling with energy. Prayers are chanted by the priests and offerings given by the faithful. When we visited prasad, blessed food, was handed out and a smiling gentleman told us ""put your cameras away and have some holy food"". A lovely experience."
,,Amazing Exterior Detail!,4.0,,"We did not visit when it was open for tours unfortunately, but...wow! The sculpture work is amazing! The carved doors are amazing! The exterior is really something to see!"
,,Welcoming religious people,5.0,,"I stayed in little india throughout my vacation in Singapore, so its an opportunity for me to visit places around to observe culture and worship. This is the nearest temple to most of the establishment in little india. The Indians invited me to get inside the temple and join the worship. I was amazed by their rituals, and they're praising a lot of Gods. Its like its part of their everyday because they proceed to their work or business."
,,Beautiful temple,5.0,,It's a small and beautiful temple in Little India area with significant decoration. Many local residents and tourists visit it. You can take stunning view from here together with walk around to enjoy the great architecture. Learning about the story was also great!
,,Hindu Temple,4.0,,Its a beautiful Hindu Temple located in Little India .Was in the nearby area so thought to visit the same and was worth it
,,Good for a Quick Visit,4.0,,"My wife, two children and I visited Singapore in June 2016. The Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple is on Serangoon Road in Little India. This is a typical Hindu temple. You have to take your shoes off before you can go inside. I think you can visit this temple in about 15 minutes and then continue your walk on Serangoon Road."
,,A great place to visit and enjoy,5.0,,This is a very busy temple and full of life. There is a lot going on around you so just take the time to enjoy what is going on around you. Remember to walk around the outside of it as part of your enjoyment.
,,Ornate temple on a busy road,3.0,,"This temple is on a busy road in little India- if you are in the area its worth a quick visit to see the ornate roof. There are lots of tourist - when I was there a school party was looking around the temple so it gets very busy on the paths around.

Cross the road and opposite you will see and indoor market - with dozens of little stores lots of gift ideas."
,,Lovelt Temple,5.0,,This is another lovely temple that can be visted nice ornation and good location. You are able to walk around inside
,,In the heart of Little India,3.0,,"This is a Hindu temple located in the heart of Little India. One of the oldest Indian temples in Singapore, it is intricately detailed and colourful and dedicated to the Hindu goddess Kali. Visitors should have appropriate dressing and removal of shoes before entry as a mark of respect."
,,Wow! wow! wow!,5.0,,"Views from outside are beautiful, with colorful gods and goddesses! The same is true inside where I saw more statues that Hindus pray to.

I slowly and quietly walked around, taking pictures of the statues, observing the priests and people praying.

Entrance is FREE. Worth my time, unlike that similar one located in Chinatown!"
,,Beautiful and Interesting,4.0,,The temple will certainly catch your eye from a distance. It is visited by locals and tourists. Beautiful. You must take off your shoes before entering.
,,Another beautiful temple to visit,4.0,,"Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple is centrally located within Little India, along Serangoon road.

A beautifully detailed temple that is dedicated to the goddess Kali, who is worshiped by Hindus all throughout India.

This is only one of the several attractively decorated temples to visit within the area and since it is a places of worship, shoes must be removed before entry as a sign of respect."
,,Interesting,5.0,,"This temple is nice and interesting. When I was inside, people were praying. There are blankets for people who aren´t dressed properly."
,,Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple,5.0,,"We were so fortunate to attend the temple when there was a festival - The Milk Festival, celebrating mothers. where milk is prayed over and poured over the statue. The noise level was high with the drums and flutes was invigorating."
,,Don't skip this while in Little India,5.0,,"Don't skip this temple while you are in Little India, it is a really fascinating insight into the way of life of the people who live here. The temple itself is stunningly decorated (be sure to check out the creepy statue of Kali eating the intestines of a human). But the nicest thing here is to see all the countless little rituals being carried out by the visitors, which is very interesting to look at."
,,Interesting,3.0,,It was very artistic and interesting however there were people praying and in the middle of worship so it felt like one was intruding while they were doing something sacred. The temple is open certain hours. Not a good place to take small kids.
,,Small Indian Temple,3.0,,You can pass and see it within 5 minutes so small with nice color and decoration free entrance You should remove your shoes before you go and at the exit they will give you vegetarian snack if you want
,,Involved in the ceremony in honor of Kali goddess,4.0,,"This is the Hindu temple that most impressed us throughout our trip in Malaysia and in Singapore, because we have stumbled in the middle of a crowded religious ceremony.
This ceremony (which seems to have repeatedly held each day) consists of public prayers to Kali goddess (the deity to whom the temple is dedicated, and whose frightening statue dominates the interior) and of distribution of blessed rice morsels to the faithful, or however, to whom wants to participate (as our case was). All the ceremony is accompanied by the sound of characteristic hand bells.
The temple is located along Serangoon Road, then the central axis of Little India. Built in the last decades of the nineteenth century as a religious landmark for the many Indian workers in Singapore, it has been restored several times (the last time since 1983).
The traveler who knows the temples of the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu (especially renowned those in Madurai) will recognize here the architectural models of that part of India (models which are also found in many other Hindu temples in Singapore and Malaysia): especially the slender pyramid above the temple's facade (gopura), covered with brightly painted statues.
The gopura, inserted in recent renovations, strongly contrasts with the history of the temple, which was originally built for the Indians from Bengal (north-east India), because they constituted the majority of immigrants in Singapore.
So it isn't a temple venerable for its antiquity or authenticity; it is rather significant for its role, in that it illustrates the culture of Hindu immigrants and ultimately the Singapore multiethnic character."
,,Very small,3.0,,Very small temple but has a very detailed design on the outside. Go along if you're in the area but wouldn't go out of your way
,,Last stop on the little India tour.,3.0,,"Little India is amazing. Take a day and wonder the streets and indulge your senses with the rich aromas of the area. Last stop on our trip was this temple. If you're into Hinduism or something similar it will be a nice stop for sure. Even if you're not, the sculptures and carvings are something to marvel at. It completes the whole 'vibe' of a walking tour through the area."
,,Temple in Little India,4.0,,"For the hindu's who would like to visit the temple during the visit should go this place. the temple is located in little india and easily accessible by metro or bus. this is part of city attractions from the hop on bus. the temple had a fixed time for opening and closing, so if you are keen to visit ensure you check the temple timing prior."
,,Riot of Colour,4.0,,"When Sir Standford Raffles had plans drawn up for the development of the future Singapore, settlement areas were delineated along ethnic lines, and for Indians living in Singapore this started the development of the area today known as Little India.

Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple, one of the oldest temples in Singapore, was built by Indian pioneers and became the focus of early Indian social and cultural life.

Sri Veeramakaliamman was selected as the chief diety of the temple, being a powerful goddess and the ""Destroyer of Evil"", answering the need of the early Indian migrants for a feeling of security in a new and strange land.

The temple is a riot of colour, and in addition to Sri Veeramakaliamman, there is a confusing pantheon of Hindu dieties and mythological creatures depicted.

If you visit, please remember that this is a sacred place of worship. Dress and act respectfully and take off your shoes before entering."
,,Dramatic,3.0,,Festival on so just took a peek when doing a walking Tour of Little India. Very dramatic temple - worth the walk
,,A great Buddhist temple in Little India,4.0,,We came across this place as it was recommended in our guide book. It opened at 4pm and we went it and it had quite a few Buddhist shrines in there. All very colourful and the clean. Only took about 5/10 minutes to visit
,,Respect,4.0,,Visited during a quick tour of little India. A lovely and colourful temple on a very busy street. Remove your shoes and wash your feet before entering and please remember that this is a temple with followers of the religion praying during all hours of the day
,,Smaller than on pictures,3.0,,"actually pretty small building with lots of people around we had a nice work through little india, but i can't say that the temple stands out"
,,Landmark after landmark,4.0,,This is just beside the Chinatown. I am able to go here because this is just near to my hostel in Singapore. A good place to appreciate religious structure.
,,Structure éblouissante / magnificent building,5.0,,"The temple was closed when I was there. However, just the gopuram is more than worth the detour. It is simply stunning !"
,,Prayer time,5.0,,"This temple is right in the heart of Little India, Singapore. One of the very well known temples built here by earliest Indians."
,,Get Kalli Amman Blessings,5.0,,"I will visit there by every Friday evening to get the blessing of veerama kali amman blessings..I found that Little India's most colorful, visually stunning temple is dedicated to the ferocious goddess Kali, depicted wearing a garland of skulls, ripping out the insides of her victims, and sharing more tranquil family moments with her sons Ganesh and Murugan. The temple is at its most evocative during each of the four daily puja (prayer) sessions.

The Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple is one of the oldest Hindu temples in Singapore and is believed to have been founded in 1881 by labourers from the North Indian state of Bengal. Being so far from home, it’s no wonder they chose such a powerful and protective goddess to dedicate the temple to.

Of course, the temple has undergone extensive renovations and rebuilding since it was founded. Its most distinguishing feature, the entrance tower with intricate carvings of Hindu deities, was added in the 1980s and is actually of a South Indian design, in contrast to the temple’s North Indian heritage.

,,This is the Hindu Temple to Visit in Singapore,5.0,,"If you want to see a decent Hindu Temple because you've never been to one, this is the one to visit. It's ornate and has a lot to see inside in a small area. There is a temple in Chinatown that is not worth seeing. But this one is good and you can spend a good 15 minutes inside just looking around. Make sure you take off your shoes before you enter. If you're female, you probably should cover your shoulders and knees. Otherwise, you can walk in and look around and take pictures. If you're in Little India, you should check this out for sure. If you're in Singapore, it's not a must do unless you specifically go to Little India. It's just a 15 minute stop."

,,Great Temple- Real People,4.0,,"Nice to visit a Temple which serves the locals- rather than a show case type. Situated on the Serangoon Rd in ""Little India"" Singapore this is a charming Hindu Temple.
We were fortunate enough to visit during a festival. Only a few tourists around and we watched respectfully from the side.
Nice place/ Nice people"
,,Bruce Pullman,4.0,,"I was impressed with how a small temple like this in Little India was so well done and lovingly maintained.

It was the start of the Festival and people were teeming in and out. It was popular with visitors and locals alike and all welcome though need to observe customs like removing shoes. There was some construction work going on so part of the area outside was dug up and rubble around. There are some information panels located around which provide background information and especially historical info. Whether it was the time of day, or that it was hot or... people seemed to be pushy and dismissive of tourists even if showing due regard for customs. In fact my partne3r decided to remain outside rather than be jostled and dismissed."

It was a new year day for south Indians and this temple was full of devotees on 26th April 2015 when we visited it in the morning hours. Still the crowed was moving orderly for blessings of the God. There are several small temples of various Hindu Gods in the premises, main deity being Sri Veeramakaliamman.

,,Attractive South Indian temple,3.0,,"I guess I've spent too much time visiting temples in India and so I'm perhaps not as impressed by the temples in Singapore as I might otherwise be. This one is certainly attractive, with plenty of attention to detail in the statue work, and particularly at the main entrance. If you have a powerful camera it's worth bringing it along to get better pics of some of the statues further away. Inside on a Saturday late morning it was quite busy with various religious ceremonies taking place, and that can be quite interesting if you haven't seen it before. One positive is that it is certainly a lot cleaner than a typical temple one might visit in India!"
,,Beutiful temple,4.0,,This temple is beutiful and there is a lot to see inside. You are allowed to take pictures inside. Do not forget to take off your shoes before entering the temple.
,,Beautifully spiritual and gorgeously designed!,4.0,,"Stumbled upon this temple whilst out exploring Little India, and I'm very glad I did. This temple was a marvellous little sanctuary for the spirit, it was breathtaking how big and beautiful it was. I'm glad I got the chance to visit!"
,,Visually stunning,4.0,,"This is a very interesting temple. It is quite large with several rooms and an outside area to explore. As with all Hindu temples you have to remove your shoes before entering.

It was filled with people all participating in various rituals. There were just a handful of what looked like tourists.

There were some quite disturbing statues and I later found out that one was the Hindu goddess Kali ripping out the insides of her victims. But the rest of the temple was colorful and beautiful.

You can easily walk here from the MRT and the hop-on hop off buses stop here."
,,Cool,4.0,,"Very cool. The culture is very authentic, this temple is cool. We got here on the hop-on-hop-off bus, which was ok."
,,If you like a bit of culture then you'll love this fantastic Hindu Temple.,4.0,,"I am definitely a culture and temple person... I'd rather spend a week looking at temples like this rather than 5 minutes in a modern shopping Mall so this attraction was right up my street.

Situated in Singapore's Little India district and built in 1855 by Tamil labourers working the lime kilns the Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple is dedicated to the Hindu goddess Kali. Kali has always been popular in Bengal, the birthplace of the labourers who built this temple. The temples entrance has the usual Hindu temple entrance tower or 'gopuram' which is an amazing jumble of colourful statues and creatures. Shoes have to be removed before entry and there is no entrance fee. Inside the temple has great cultural ambience bursting with colourful deities, shrines and aromas. The temple is not that large so you only need about 20 minutes to visit it.

In short I would certainly recommend a visit to this fabulous temple and also to the other main Hindu temple in Singapore that is in Chinatown, (Sri Mariamman Temple)."
,,Best Hindu Temple,5.0,,"The most beautiful Hindu Temple in Singapore, no doubt. Strategically located within Little India, 600 meters from the nearest MRT station. Connected well with SBS Buses, taxies available. Interior of the temple - majestic and beautiful. Clean and petite. Dr.Ruben Kumar Maniam Malaysia"
,,Colorful and lively,4.0,,"Colorful temple with a huge collection of painted statues. Make sure to take your shoes off outside. A quick walk around will suffice to see the various statues of gods. I had no idea what kind of service or even if it was a service going on, but it was very lively and interesting."
,,Sri veelraramakali the great lord mother,5.0,,"Excellent temple, very artistic and divine experience visiting the temple. Lord Shiva can also be prayed in this temple besides lord ganesh and Subramanya. Mostly crowded over weekends avoid visiting this temple on saturday/sunday due to heavy rush"
,,Great temple to visit,4.0,,Visited this Hindu temple as part of a walking tour. The temple was great to visit . A very peaceful place. It is worth a visit but is better with a guide who can explain all the traditions etc.
,,A glorious place,5.0,,"What a great building from both an architectural and spiritual perspective. Easy enough to get to via one of the tourist bus companies or from the MRT on the main Serangoon Road, you can't exactly miss it!

A local guy I'm working with advised to avoid Little India on a Sunday as that's when the place can get very busy and a little raucous with all the workers on a day off, so I went on the Saturday.

Felt very comfortable inside and was politely ignored while the ceremonies went on, which was nice, meant it didn't feel like I was intruding. These guys know it's a tourist hot spot as well as a religious building so there's no uneasiness in the place.

Has to be on your top 5 if your in Singapore for any time."

,,Pleasent,4.0,,"was a very nice temple, very calm and pleasant even though it was on to the main road side, the temple was clean and neat"
,,Peaceful,4.0,,A place to worship for Tamil people. This temple is same like temples of South India. A great artistic work is done by the artist to build this temple. This temple depicts pure south Indian culture. It is must to visit place if you want to experience India in singapore
,,A great taster into Hinduism and plenty incense!,4.0,,"I really enjoyed this temple, it has many different shrines inside and beautiful detail on the outside. You need to leave your shoes outside the front of the temple which some people might not be keen on. Although you don't need long here its location is great for browsing some shops and getting a real Indian meal. The temple and the surrounding area is really a little taste of India and I would recommend it to anyone with a few spare hours."
,,Awesome temple to visit.,3.0,,"Very close to Mustafa - walkable distance/ Avoid evenings though, as it can be very crowded. Eating places are nearby Mustafa. Lots of buses plying from that road towards north, Close to Farrer Park MRT"
,,"Big beautiful Hindu temple, a little more busier than others.",4.0,,"Photography was permitted here which was great, the only thing was that the facade of the temple was hidden under covers as it was under maintenance, but the interior of the temple gives you an idea of what it looks like on the outside. Also got to see the rituals performed by worshippers which was interesting to watch. There is some souvenirs you can purchase as well to cherish the memory of visiting the temple. Recommended if strolling through Little India."
,,Interesting. Badly located on Bing Maps at present.,3.0,,"Links below show its location: http://wikimapia.org/#lang=en&lat=1.315240&lon=103.858062&z=18&m=m https://maps.google.com/maps?q=sri+vadapathira+temple&ie=UTF-8&ei=fAfXUuLrFKrwyAGx9ID4Cw&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAg It may be of more interest to you if you're Hindu, or interested in temple architecture and design. Beyond that, it's part of the heritage assets of the Serangoon Road area."
,,Interesting Temple,4.0,,"We visited on a Saturday morning, so got to observe worshippers visiting the temple, which was quite crowded. The colorful statuary and decoration of the temple was quite elaborate in this centrally located Little India landmark."
,,Divine !,5.0,,"Peace, calm and serene - its a beautiful temple with amazing sculptures all over the walls. Being from India - it is great to find this temple in Singapore. Very near to the Farrer Park MRT- also good connectivity via buses. It is situated on the Serangoon street on the main road and is easily findable. Also near by is the Perumal temple. Thanks to Trip Advisor - for helping me find this place !!"
,,Best Hindu Temple in Singapore,5.0,,"I walked around Little India and found it with crowdy people in front of the gate. Look everybody busied but they are very nice. No ticket fees cause this is temple, everyone cheerful and helpful. I didn't know the Hindu ceremony so many people like to explained to me. And I felt their warm heart with hospitality. Not for trade or tourist but it is culture. Thank you, I'll go there next time."
,,A Singapore Must Do!,5.0,,"An absolutely fascinating insight into the Hindu religion and a ""must do"" for any trip to Singapore. Make sure it is combined with some sort of food experience from the many nearby options!"
,,Beautiful sight,4.0,,"No trip to Little India is complete without visiting this temple! I belive this closes at lunchtime, so get thee early"
,,Fantastic Indian Temple and nice location,4.0,,"Too many idols and great artistic work to see and thats why so many tourists use to come. Location of the place is very good, near to Little India Mrt and it can be combined with other trips very easily (other temple around this location and restaurants like Jungle tandoori, Khansama, Kailash Parbat, Komlas, Muthu's curry and many more)

Priest and temple staffs are very friendly and on special days they provides prasad (dinner) with coffee.

But its very crowded on public holiday and weekends."
,,If you visit just one Hindu temple in Singapore...,4.0,,"If you visit just one Hindu Temple in Singapore, this should be it ... and you should do it on a Sunday. The place will be packed by devotees on a Sunday, all wearing their nicest clothes, bringing lots of flowers and gifts to their gods. The rituals are well worth watching and admiring. If you are unfamiliar with the Hindu religions, this can be an eye opening and extremely illuminating and informative experience. Highly recommended."
,,I've only appreciated the wonderful facade.,4.0,,"Unfortunately, during my visit to Singapore because of the renovations the temple was temporarily closed, the only thing that I was able to see was the large entrance door but even more beautiful and evocative sculpture depicting the many statues of Hindu gods and under the other almost to form a sort of pyramid. A very nice image."
,,Very busy temple,4.0,,"A short walk from MRT and built in 1881. Hindu temple and you must remove your shoes before entering. It was very busy inside and I felt a little uncomfortable taking photographs here - but I did. Other temples I visited in chinatown seemed more geared up for visitors but I felt a little bit that I was intruding on people praying here - nobody made me feel uncomfortable it just was not that big for the amount of people inside. We personally did not find Little India as interesting as Chinatown and got off the train visited this temple and then went to chinatown which was great (visited 4 beautiful temples there). If you are in Singapore it is worth a visit to Little India, just to get off the train, walk down the streets and visit as least this one temple."
,,Very interesting,3.0,,"Hindu temple - remember to remove your shoes! Very busy, people eating all over the place - not really my cup of tea, but an interesting place nevertheless. Oh, and get there early."
,,Here for wedding...,5.0,,I was here for a wedding. A nice small temple that is ok to enter. The colors and statues are amazing. Remember to leave a donation as thanks for allowing you to enter.
,,God things comes in small package,5.0,,"A hindu temple is usually a large complex structure with 4 ways to enter amidst 2layers of walls. THis temple represents cultural heritage, rich and vibrant colors, rituals and beliefs unlike anthing you will come across. Its a must see and doesnt matter if you Are local or foreigner, everybody feels at home once you are inside. Main't deity is goddess Kali. BEst time to visit is mornings after 7am and in evenings after 5pm."
,,Really interesting to see,5.0,,"This ia really interesting Temple - a visit inside with reveal many intriguing rituals of Hindu life - monks cleanse and bathe the deities then use the holy water in the temple - there are several deities worshipped here, for various reasons - visitors are allowed and welcome, but you must respect their beliefs and discard your shoes at the door."
,,Good,4.0,,I came to this part of town just to see the outside of this temple. It is worth taking the time to see it as it is quite impressive.
,,Don't skip it!,4.0,,"I went to this temple on my first day in Singapore as it was located near my hotel.
I found it to be an enriching cultural experience, particularly because when I arrived there was a praying ceremony in progress.
The architecture is typical for a Hindu temple: lots of statues crowded on its roof and beautiful colors. I particularly liked the doors, which were adorned with lots of bells.
Free entrance, lots of restaurants nearby, so I recommend you don't skip it!"
,,You may enter...,4.0,,"As long as you remove your shoes you are welcome to enter this temple.(Make sure you don't wear nice shoes or they could disappear outside while your admiring this culture.)
People were very friendly inside. A lady came up to me as I was sitting on the ground and offered me a treat. Extremely kind."
,,Must See if in Little India,4.0,,"I didn't go to Little India to see this particular temple but what a pleasure it was to stumble upon it! We timed our visit just right, at noon during the week, there was a special ceremony going on [please forgive my ignorance in regard to the Hindu religion, so I apologize if I offend anyone]. Be prepared to remove shoes and socks [please be barefoot] to enter the temple. The artwork and detail in the status of the Deities is wonderful! As a westerner I felt very welcome and did not receive any glaring looks."
,,Great Place to Visit,5.0,,"Very interesting stop while in Singapore. Take a few minutes to soak everything in, and pay attention to the ornate decorations."
,,Worth Visiting,3.0,,"Lcated on Serangoon Rd adjacent to Belilios Rd.

A beautiful temple located in the middle of Little India. Definitely worth the visit if your not a Hindu or never been to a temple before. Great colours and architecture.

Surrounded by great Indian restaurants both vegetarian & non vegetarian.

And its free to enter, so why not."
,,nice for a 5min visit if you are in the area : ),3.0,,"I loved the architecture, very ornate. This is definitely worth a look at if you are around there, but it is small and there is not a lot to see. Would be good to go and pray in if you are Hindi though!!"
,,Temple,5.0,,Sri vadapathia temple is very near to hotel and on highway square near signals merely walking distance from changi hotel.during tour i was in search of temple and at last found this temple on visit to this temple my all requirments fullfilled.Offrings are also inside temple pujaris are co.operativ and vedic .they permed puja as per indian style which gives me more satisfaction.Vibrations are very high inside temple as pujaris are always one puja or reciting sone shalokas while performig morning aarti as well as evening aarti or abhishekem.
,,First visit to a Hindu temple,4.0,,"I visited this temple as part of the ""Little India"" Walk with Singapore Walks (our guide was Carol). Entrance is free and they make persons of all faiths feel welcome. You must remove your shoes before entering but the views inside are rather interesting. There were many worshipers there so politeness and respect are mandatory.

Unless you have previous knowledge of Hinduism, I would suggest going with a guide as you will get more from the experience. The goddess Kali, to whom the Temple is dedicated, is a rather colorful deity and many of the ornate decorations shows her in quite violent moods. Her sons, one of whom was turned into an elephant in the legend, are featured prominently throughout the surroundings."
