,,wow.. lovly,5.0,,happy to travel by Cable Car. nice city view and relaxing. good price for raveling... I went with my friend and we will travel again..
,,Excellent service,5.0,,"very well managed and nice service. Visited Sentosa by taking cable care.
Sentosa is a tiny island and it's very beautiful."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"One word for this experience in cable car is Amazing. Must visit if you are in Singapore
You get a full view of City.

Well organized, mantained and managed.

Will be a good experience for kids"
,,Great!,5.0,,The cable car ride from Sentosa to mainland island Singapore is beautiful. We did both cable car rides - one short one in Sentosa and the longer one to mainland Singapore. It is a must.
,,Annoying booking,1.0,,We booked a ticket the das before we went there. And they didn't manage to send us the tickets early enough. By the way you have to que anyway. We needed to call the service and still waiting for the tickets.
,,great experience,3.0,,"the kids was so happy, everythings look good from the above and the cable car was convenience too.. good experince afterall."
,,Very hot inside,3.0,,"Singapore is always hot and worst of all, the cable car is not air conditioned and it is extremely stuffy and hot inside. Regret taking this cable car."
,,Excellent and Amazing,5.0,,"Ride is fantastic, wow, it gives amazing view of sentosa. Equivalent to the ride the cabin is clean & neatly designed. You should be informed well before taking the ride - to depart @ which station."
,,Better than I expected by far,5.0,,"This was such a cool experience. Taking a cable car to a man made island paradise is something you definitely can't do most places. It was run very efficiently, I had no wait. When you arrive on Sentosa (island) there's a surprisingly cool gift shop - reasonably priced unique trinkets. The way back is a little more complicated as you take two cars and that confused me - but to be fair I had spent the day at Universal, Hard Rock etc and I was exhausted and not 100% sober. The signage isn't unclear, it's just a longer walk than I thought."
,,Great Views,5.0,,"I'm terrified of heights but loved the cable car. It was daytime when we were on it & never much of a line up.
We got off at each of the stops between Sentosa Island & Faber Mountain, also did the cable car that goes across Sentosa Island to get a good view of everything there."
,,Good views,5.0,,The cable car offers a good way to get into Sentosa Island and offers good views as well. Buy tickets for both sets of cable cars
,,It is good to get the Faber Membership,4.0,,Price at $135 for a family is like buying a full trip tickets for all 4 to 5 of us and it allows us to travel unlimited time as a family to view the beautiful scenery. Only bad point is parking is very limited for weekend.
,,cable car ride,3.0,,you get a great view of singapore especially sentosa island. You see more than you would otherwise . its a good family thing to do. You get ideas of what to see next too.
,,Enjoyable experience,5.0,,"Pre-booked tickets. Staff very happy and helful. We did the round trip. Got the wrist stamped and were called ""power rangers"". A bit of fun was good."
,,Awesome Views,5.0,,We got on the Cable car at the HarbourFront tower and got off at Sentosa Island where we spent the day. It was a great relaxing ride across with some awesome views of Singapore.
,,Fantastic Views,5.0,,"I am so glad we decided to take the Cable Car across to Sentosa Island. A smooth, comfortable ride and the views are amazing"
,,The one and only one in Singapore,4.0,,My kids alway wanted me to bring them for a cable car ride but I find it expensive and to just go for a round trip. Brought them to the cable car station last week to see how cable car works. We had a long walk from the Mount Faber. By the time they make it to the top I think they are too tired to ask for a trip.
,,Enjoy..enjoy..,5.0,,Aerial link between mount Faber and Sentosa resort. Enjoy the Faber peak and Sentosa with cable car sky network
,,Worth the trip,4.0,,"We enjoyed our day riding the cable car and swimming at Siloso beach. Stopped in for coconut ice cream before our swim, then enjoyed each leg of the cable car ride. Highly recommended. Don't get caught out though - it is one price for natives and a higher price for tourists."
,,Only if your not too afraid of heights,4.0,,"I did both the cable cars from Santosa Island and was extremely impressed, both with the view and the way they are laid out. A little scary at the high spots but well worth the trip. You can also get off and back on at various intervals to explore further,"
,,Great views of Singapore,5.0,,"I read a blog prior which recommended catching the cable car from the harbour front up to mount Faber to have a look around and then go across to Sentosa Island. This worked really well so would definitely recommend this route.
Don't miss Faber peak views and the toilet with one of the best views in the world (in the cable car building). Once on Sentosa there is a further set of cable cars included in the ticket price. These give great views over the island."
,,Aerial view of Santosa by cable car,5.0,,"Cable car goes from Harbour front to Faber park to Santosa and back. It is a wonderful experience to aerially view and cover this entire area, Faber park, Harbour front and Santosa. Maintained very well. I liked it very much and recommend to the traveller to Singapore."
,,Soaring high!,5.0,,A fantastic way to see Singapore from above. The pods are spacious and well ventilated. We really enjoyed the trip.
,,Amazing bird’s eye view!,4.0,,"What a better way of an aerial view of the Southern part of Singapore than from a cable car! We saw fantastic views of the southern waterfront, the awesome architectural characters of the buildings around it, the economic & social activities below & Sentosa Island with its boundless attractions. The area is vibrant even on a weekday, theming with locals & tourists having a good time! The loop system of cable cars from 3 key points- Harbourfront, Mount Faber & Sentosa make good sense & offers satisfying bird’s eye view."
,,Maybe I'm just not a cable (car) guy,3.0,,"I didn't find the view spectacular. It's really quite short and expensive (I mean, think about actually great views, or on a ski lift for example).

And let's not forget in recent history a ship tore one of these cars off the cable. FACT.

Maybe I'm just not a cable car guy.

I would be so bold as to say The Cable Guy with Jim Carrey was more memorable. Even with Giles bringing beers along for the ride.

Maybe I should just lay cable.

HINT: so as your day doesn't just revolve around this cable, why not add a Southern Ridges walk, including Henderson Waves and gelato and art at Gillman Barracks. Tag the cable on just for bucket lists or something."
,,Truly beautiful views,5.0,,"I went from the beach to Mount Farber in 40 min.

There are two tracks for the cable cars. I took both. It is a good and fast way to get the the big southern island. It is common to see the locals use it as well. Te full day trip price is 35SGD, but for just 4 extra dollars, you can get a year round pass. It is just super hard to get that pass. Great views of southern Singapore.

To get the pass, you have to go back to the station that you bought your ticket from, then tell them you want to pay for a year pass. They will instruct you to go to a website then you have to wait two weeks for confirmation and I stopped there.

You can get a family pass as well."
,,Enjoyed the cable car,4.0,,We enjoyed cable car from Mt Faber. We changed to the Siloso line and on the way back had lunch before taking the cable car back to Mt Faber.
,,Love the cable cars.,5.0,,"Get an all day pass and explore all the routes... yes there are several. You can pop into the themed area of Sentosa, catch the monorail to the beach (included in ticket) and head to Imbiah Lookout. Travel all day to your hearts content... but know that if you travel early (9am) you have a chance of missing the crowds. Take your swimmers. Disappointed to see that Sentosa is now a fully functioning theme park with Universal Studios and many more attractions. Kids paradise!"
,,Interesting,3.0,,"Singapore doesn’t have high hills, so a cable car ride cannot be spectacular. It does provide interesting views of Sentosa’s development, and this activity is enjoyable for young children. If you were to join, might as well take it from Mt. Faber to Sentosa (rather than just the portion between Harbourfront and Sentosa), as otherwise it would be too short a ride. Surprisingly, they don’t sell one-way tickets. This is annoying as the only way to find transport at Mt. Faber Station is via Grab."
,,Interesting,5.0,,We enjoyed travelling from Mt Faber to Sentosa on the cable car. Offers a lovely view of the Harbour.
,,Amazing experience at cable car,5.0,,"One of the best cable card visited so far, was with my friends and enjoyed the ride a lot got scenic views of the island and the city altogether a must visit for everyone visiting Singapore."
,,The view is spectacular.,5.0,,"The views from the cable car ride were spectacular. My husband is scared of heights but managed this ride. You feel safe inside the large cars and they run smoothly. We alighted from Faber Peak and enjoyed the ride right through to Sentosa Island. We travelled over the top of two cruise ships last time and you get a birds eye view of some of the activities happening on Sentosa Island. There was no waiting to buy tickets and a small line to get on which moved quickly. If you return to Faber Peak, cab drivers dont wait there you will have to organise pick up, or just return to the Harbourfront centre."
,,Start @ mount Faber.,5.0,,"Mount Faber is a good starting point. Then you can buy tickets and link up all 3 rides.
Stop off at any and explore. Great for photograph buffs both on and off the cable ride.
As usual, lots of gift & souvenir shops, Coffee bars and food shops.
Can be a lovely half days entertainment."
,,First time - great experience,5.0,,"After many visits/stop-overs in Singapore over the years, we finally undertook the Cable Car ride - once during the day up to Mt Faber and then across to Sentosa Island - and a nightime return jouney from the Island. Absolutely fabulous. Well organised and great views. Will made the efoort on our next visit to do the wonderful Singapore Cable Car again (and again!)"
,,Cable Car Coasting through the sky to fabulous views,5.0,,"Mount Faber starting point is beautiful. I took a taxi and fell in love with the area.

The booking office was really helpful, explaining you can get off at a stop, and also encouraged me to go to Santosa to extend my cable car journey. So glad that I did!
Even from the ladies washroom, the scene is magnificent and gave me more courage to see more. I went mid-morning when it was quiet and had a cable car to myself. When I first set off, I held onto the side of the chair, and then let go and looked beneath me and all around to such beauty. I stoped off at Santosa, got another cable car to the end of the line, and spent the afternoon at the beach, and had a lovely meal. Then go the connection back. Tips. get off at the Harbour so that you can get a taxi as taxis at Mount Faber are very infrequent."
,,Great experience,5.0,,Fantastic views and given panorama. Definitely worth the extra dollars. Make sure you do the Mt Faber link as well.
,,Better than it looks,5.0,,"Take te Cable car across to the island and discover it is bigger than it looks there are three sections of the cable car and your ticket covers all three, do not miss any and if you are polite and ask you will be able to go round again if it is not to busy."
,,Great Views,5.0,,Had a wonderful trip on the Singapore Cable Car/ make sure you go to Faber Mountain to catch the cable car from: superb views. Then head to Siloso Beach in the cable car and enjoy lunch on the beach! Wonderful day.
,,Wonderful experince,5.0,,An amazing experience. You can get beautiful aerial views of the city and Sentosa Island. If you time it well you can get both day and night views. You can also go to Mount Faber Park to get good city views from the heights. I took a one day sky pass which allows you to board and get down at each station on both the lines once. To get city views travel on Mt.Faber line. To get views of Sentosa and its beaches travel on Sentosa line. I would suggest to travel on both since both cable cars and the views you get are different.
,,Singapore Cable Car,5.0,,"This is by far the most convenient way to get to Sentosa plus you'll get awesome views of Singapore. We opted to take the ride around late afternoon so we can get the view of the sunset and a bit of night lights. I also advise to go around this time as the cable car can get a bit hot inside during the day since it's not air conditioned. If you are a group of just 2 or 3, you may get to be joined into another group since I think it has a capacity of up to 6-8 people? Anyhow, I enjoyed our experience here."
,,Fun and Amazing views,5.0,,This is a great way to travel fun for any age and the views are amazing. Definitely a must do. Enjoy
,,Nice views,4.0,,"I’m not a fan of cable cars but this was the smoothest ride I’ve ever been on.
We thought it was expensive as we only wanted to travel over to Sentosa & return - the cost was Singapore $35 each. However, there are additional cable car rides included in the ticket price."
,,Cable Car from Mount Faber to Sentosa,4.0,,"The cable car is a great way to travel over to Sentosa from Mount Faber, lovely view. Visit the toilets before you get on the cable car, fab view from there with all glass front. A loo with a view! Be aware that when returning to Mount Faber there is no taxi rank. We had to walk all the way down the hill to the main road and then figure out which way to get a bus. You cannot flag a taxi down as it is dual carriageway and they are not allowed to stop in bus stops. It took 2 hours for us to get back to our hotel which is only a 15 minute drive away."
,,JUST DO IT.,5.0,,"Well planned and executed cable car system, greatly organised as with all other attractions in Singapore."
,,Must see and do,5.0,,This is fantastic and such good value for money. The pass we bought enabled us to use the cable cars around Sentosa also. Great views and the restaurant at Faber Peak also has the best views over a beer.
,,Another membership,4.0,,"The kids were complaining that they hadn't been on the Cable Car for a while, so we decided to get another membership. It would have been more sensible to renew the previous membership when it expired as the renewal rates are lower, but we didn't quite get around to it. Still, it's not bad value for $135 for a year for a family of 4. Luckily our youngest is still below the threshold level of 4 years of age - otherwise it's a full adult membership rate to add him to the package. THe membership deal isn't quite as good as it used to be - no longer get free access by car or by train to Sentosa, only by cable car."
,,A must do during Singapore visit,5.0,,"This should not be missed during a Singapore visit - and must be done from Mount Faber to Sentosa. Beautiful, scenic, systematic and safe. A truly fantastic experience. Best to take it around noon to reach Sentosa and return at night to enjoy both daylight & night time views."
,,Sentosa cable car,4.0,,Not a big fan of cable cars but this was amazing very smooth and wonderful views well worth the money.
,,Great way of getting to Sentosa,5.0,,"I went on the cable car as part of a visit to Sentosa Island with my family. It is a great way to get there. The cars are spotless and comfortable enough for the fifteen minute ride.

The view is absolutely outstanding and I would think you might spend most of the trip taking pictures.

The terminal on Sentosa Island gives you further travel options to get around the island, making it easy to do so.

One thing to remember is on the return journey, if you are going to catch a taxi to proceed further, it is better to get off at the Harbour Front station and not the Mount Faber. This is because Harbour Front has access to a taxi rank and an MRT station, whereas if you get off at Mt Faber, you will have to call your own taxi as there is no cab rank there.

All in all a great experience."
,,Must Do !!!,4.0,,A Cable Car connection Faber Peak to Harbour Point to Sentosa Island. One-Way Cable car is must. There are 2 Cable Car Routes. It is fun !!!
,,Good to go on it once.,3.0,,"Singapore is not ""hilly""and although the cars are nice with windows in the floor you can now get to Sentosa by many methods unlike before. In addition to do the most interesting route leaving from Fraser's Hill you have to make a special journey there. Unless you fancy a walk and then well you will enjoy the leisurely glide down! You do get a good view of the port and cruise centre on the way across."
,,Breathtaking view from this cable car ride,5.0,,"Awesome experience when we ride the cable car to and fro from sentosa to faber moutain ,its reach at such high level that you would be able to see almost whole singapore from there ,you feel like you are flying in the air."
,,Amazing views and a smooth ride,5.0,,"We bought the pass for all lines, you can get off at each stop and have a look around or just stay on board for the round trip.
The views were amazing, definitely take a camera.
There were no queues for every time we had a car to ourselves.
A bit expensive but definitely worth it"
,,Worth it!,5.0,,Bought my ticket at klook at almost half the price for both lines. Enjoyable and scary when the wind rocks the cable car.
,,Sort of a rip off,3.0,,"Can’t buy one way passes. The view is nice but the inside of the cable cars are not air conditioned. On the main ride to and from santosa, you have to share the car usually b/c it seats up to 8. When you get to the island, there isn’t much need to ride the inter-island cable cars. The fee you pay at the beginning includes all this. The price on this website is out dated. It’s even more- it was $105 Singaporean dollars for 3 of us. We went on the intra island one just to get our money’s worth. There are cheaper ways to get to and from the island- save your money for other stuff on the island- everything on this island is very expensive!"
,,Fabulous views,5.0,,We chose to go by Cable Car to Sentosa Island and although I don't have a head for heights (and this was HIGH) the views were spectacular and I am very glad I did it!
,,Nice view and pricey,4.0,,"I done this one time, its office is located behind the aquarium. It was safe and i got a nice view. Recommended but it doesn't go very high"
,,My Honeymoon in Singapore 2019,5.0,,"A great place for traveling 🌸🌸🌸 You shoule try some fun activities on Sentosa island, especially Universal Studio, Wing of times ,..."
,,travel to singapore on rope,4.0,,travel in cable car from mount faber to Santosa its nice experience to move on rope over the singapore.
,,City and Sentosa View from the Top,4.0,,We took the cable car to reach Sentosa. Overall the ride was nice and you get good view of the city and Sentosa from the top. Kids really enjoyed the ride.
,,A different perspective,4.0,,"We caught bus out to Sentosa island which was only S$3 for two people and just looked around the shops and had lunch. Cable car was I think around S$35 each but that gave you a few rides to different areas and also across to the Mt Faber where we had a Singapore Sling in the cafe built around a tree and back to the Harbour where we caught a taxi home, The view was interesting and different to the Sky Park."
,,Incredible views of Sentosa,5.0,,Beautiful view of Sentosa and Singapore.... well worth it . You can get there from the city by MRT and the trip out there is a great day!!
,,Enjoyable,4.0,,"We took the ride from the Harbourfront shopping centre rather than Faber Peak, but it was a nice ride, good views, didn’t last too long. Cars had good viewing windows to take photos (unlike the cable car on Sentosa - that one has decals all along the viewing space!)
I’m always up for a cable car and was glad we got to do this one."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,I have a real thing about cable cars so this was a must do. Really enjoyed it and went mid week so had cable cars to myself. Fabulous views and scenery. Loved it.
,,Good ride with great views,4.0,,You can take cable car ride to sentosa island from mount Faber peak. The ride is quick and offer views of Singapore sky line and sea fronts. You cross channel and reach sentosa island by this ride.
,,Ride in the rains,5.0,,We had a good time in the cable ride. The cable started smoothly and die to rain and thunder lightning it was stopping in between. It was a lovely and adventurous ride for me and my family.
,,Perfect View while moving,5.0,,"From Sentosa, you can see a wide range of Wonderful and Amazing facts, surrounding the area. from variety of Amusement, Restaurants, to the very nice view of the sea and bayfronts around the Lion City."
,,Great viewd,4.0,,We had a morning to fill in before our flight and this was a very pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. It wasn’t busy so we had the cable car to ourselves each time. Very nice views. We didn’t spend any length of time on Sentosa but it looked as though you could do just about anything!
,,A perspective from above,4.0,,"We actually walked across the bridge to get to Sentosa Island but decided to take the scenic route back via the Singapore Cable Car.
You can purchase tickets at various booths that are well marked, and our trip cost $33 each.
We did round trips on both legs, purely to get an aerial view of the island, and as part of our tourist experience.
Lines can be long, and the cars seat 8 so you won’t get a car to yourself, but it was a good experience and I really enjoyed seeing the other parts of this resort island.
I think it was well worth it, it added to our day!"
,,Enjoyable ride,4.0,,"Bought a 1-day pass for Singapore + Sentosa Island cable cars, to explore the island. I'd say it was worth the price, as the views were quite good, even though not as impressive as you can get at the bay. Still not bad at all. Stations are located in strategic points from which you can walk around and explore the area. I'd say cabins are a bit dated, and windows start to hinder photo opportunities, and in general they feel a bit too closed to truly enjoy the surroundings. Nevertheless, it's fun!

Keep in mind that if you are taking it from the Mt Faber station (and returning there), then be sure you can call up a taxi (or know your bus routes), otherwise transport there is a bit scarce... Other option is to go to the Promenade station and take a train ride (or a taxi) from there."
,,Nice experience,4.0,,My little boys were very happy and excited with the experience of cable car. Security ok. Little difficult to find starting pls for new comers.
,,Amazing views,4.0,,Did the cable car from Sentosa Island and had lunch and drinks at Mt Faber. Caught it back down later in the afternoon. It's something you should really do when in Singapore.
,,Please don't waste your money,2.0,,"When you go to the ticket office, it gives the impression that you can get a cable car ticket for $18. But that isn't the case. It's $35. Considering the short journey and the cash cow at the other end of it. Please don't waste your money. This truly truly isn't worth it. Simply go to a tall building nearby and go to the top floor, it'll be far cheaper and you'll get the same view."
,,Great for the view.,4.0,,"What can I say, the Singapore Cable Car is a great place to grab a view of Singapore and Sentosa Island from. It's also a great way to escape from the heat of the day. The only downside for us was when we reached the Mt Faber station about 5 bus loads of people had just been dropped there to catch the Cable Car, thus we walked back to the train station via the stairway."
,,"If you have height issues, don't do it",5.0,,"We did this 10 years ago and it was a good ride, very high above the ground in some area's especially over the port, where you go over the cruise ships.
While in Singapore this time we went as a family from Sentosa, as we were staying there.
The ride is an enjoyable one with amazing views, although I did get a little scared when the ride stopped and the cable cars bounced around twice! Above the port!.
Overall it was a great experience and seeing the changes to the port area from 10 years ago was also interesting."
,,Optional if you have done flyer wheel,3.0,,This was an average experience for me. I would recommend the flyer wheel vs the cable car. I used this to reach Sentosa island. However on reaching Sentosa island I had to walk a lot to reach aquarium which became difficult for me with small kids and elderly.
,,Good to see.,4.0,,"Caught the cable car across to the island. great views and very quiet. Once you get to the islan not well sign posted and poor toilets at the top, use the ones at the resort area."
,,Cable Journey to Senthosa,5.0,,"I checked in cable car at Mount Faber at 10.30am and I was a bit nervous initially because of the height. As the journey begun I started to love it. The best part was when we were crossing the sea (above the harbour). I could see a huge ship underneath and it was the first time I had seen a ship in aerial view. As I pass the see, I could see a wave pool and i could hear the people screaming for fun. Then i had to get down in next station and board onto another cable in a different station few hundred metres away. It took me almost another 10 minutes to reach my destination and I was able to witness alot of mind blowing scenarios in between."
,,Not worth the cost,3.0,,Very expensive way to get to sentosa- not a bad view but not worth the money. Sales staff rather aggressive in their sales tactics.Wouldn't do it again or recommend
,,Awesome views,5.0,,This is a must for families. We headed to Sentosa for a swim and to try the iFly parachuting. The cable car carriage was a little hot - but this is Singapore after all! Not for those with vertigo. You can look for discounted tickets online through agencies that
,,Below expectation - and very expensive,2.0,,"Arriving in pouring rain there was no shelter to get to the cable car that was very expensive. Due to the bad weather, there was no queue and at the same time, one can not see the panorama. At the mid station, there was no one who could give information about further options or change to the other line.

On the way back we chose the train, so the cable car adventure was a fail."
,,Dinner and three laps not worth the cost,2.0,,"So ended up paying twice as the tour operator cocked up and booked me in the day before, staff there didnt care and made me pay again. Did three laps for cold mushroom soup, a nice duck salad, ok beef and nice salmon and an ok dessert with a small glass of wine and coffee.
If I were you I'd just do one lap in the car."
,,"""Nice view, nice Ride""",4.0,,"We enjoyed riding the Cable Car, seeing almost the whole Sentosa area and be able to see the glimpse of what are we going to explore next.. Our ride is a little bit hot because of summer and late in the afternoon, but definitely is fun."
,,View - tastic,4.0,,Day or night the view from the Cable Car is wonderful. Don't be afraid the ride is smooth and easy and over before you know it.
,,Walid Abou Farhat,1.0,,If you want to feel stupid then buy the dinner option! It is expensive not worth a penny! Buy the cheapest ticket and do the cable tour and then go have dinner somewhere else and have a good bite. Do not believe anyone rhat this is an amazing experience because it is not. You do certainly not need to turn round over same place for 1h30 and have a meal that is inflated to the maximum with no taste to write the least
,,Secure and interesting cable car,5.0,,"We traveled within Sentosa in cable car, and it was a great experience with friendly and helpful staff"
,,"Excellent ride, expensive!",4.0,,"Would have been a 5* review if not for the price tag that comes with the Cable car ride

The ride itself is amazing. We started from the Mount Faber and went all the way to the Sentosa Station. The views from the Mount Faber to Harbourfront are amazing and so are the views from Harbourfront to Sentosa station.

Between the Harbourfront and Sentosa, the car goes to its highest point that provides a nice birds eye view of the entire Sentosa Island. From here, you can see the Universal Studios, Water park, Merlion, etc. This is the best part of the ride

The other line (Imbiah - Sentosa - Siloso) offers an excellent view of the beach side of the Sentosa Island. It is a good way to go to the Siloso point and Siloso Fort.

Overall, the ride itself is enjoyable, but for many the cost would be a deal breaker.

One way takes about 20 minutes (Mount Faber to Sentosa) and 10 minutes (Imbiah to Siloso)"
,,Great Fun and Terrific Way to See Singapore,5.0,,Do this on your first day in Singapore as you get a birds eye view and a great perspective of Singapore
,,meh,3.0,,"this is way to expensive for what it is $38S , you get just a short trip over and back and it just not worth it"
,,GREAT IF YOU LIKE HEIGHTS,5.0,,Unfortunately I was petrified as i'm not good with heights but was determined to try it. The views were spectacular and the cable car was sooooo high we had to change midway. Everyone loved it.
,,A must do in Singapore,5.0,,"We caught the MRT to Harbourfront and then got on the MT Faber Line. It's a fabulous way to travel, and to sit above and watch one of the busiest ports in the world. We bought the tickets to do the Sentosa Cable Car too. Lots of photo opportunities."
,,A must-do thing,5.0,,This cable car provides the best view of the city as well as Sentosa Island. The trip is about 15 to 20 minutes. You cannot take any better pictures without getting on one of these unless you are on a helicopter.
,,Great fun and Photo opportunitys,4.0,,Good fun and you dont have to share with strangers. . Outstanding views for photos and a good gentle ride. Would definitely recommend. Reasonably priced and a must do.
,,Family holiday,5.0,,"We went on the cable car when visiting Singapore. It was awesome, scary but well worth the price. We took the full journey to santosa island and return. Very clean and awesome views. Oh and you can take a beer to calm the nerves."
,,The best way to visit Sentosa,5.0,,We always include as the entrance point to Sentosa Island as it provides great views. Can be used to return to the mid station at the end of the day to the access cabs or the MRT.
,,Amazing views!!,4.0,,Used this to get from Harbour Front to Sentosa Island and back. Get some good views of the area and surrounds as you go across. Also rode the second line on the island and get some great views of the beach area on Sentoas. Well worth the money.
,,Good Expensive Ride,4.0,,"Not worth the money , expensive. No one way, forced to buy the full ticket. Handling of groups and crowds not great, perhaps to many tourists and business is good but people need to be treated with courtesy."
,,Good experience,5.0,,Used it to go to Sentosa. Very convenient and no hassle at all. The kids enjoyed it too. Must try when in Singapore.
,,Fun for a one time experience,3.0,,The cable car was fun for a one time experience. It gives you a nice view of the surrounding area. The operators were careful not to overcrowd the cable cars. My husband and I had a car to ourselves on the way to Sentosa. We went mid afternoon and all the glass from the cable car windows made it very hot & uncomfortable inside the car
,,Fun way to get around Sentosa,5.0,,Check out the options and the where to get on and off. Not cheap but worth the effort to experience this attraction.
,,Great way to travel to Sentosa,5.0,,"I used the Weekend Go Where app to book discounted tickets for the Sentosa and Mount Faber Lines, which I collected at Harbourfront, Tower 2. The views from the cars were fantastic. An excellent way to cover the island of Sentosa, and more enjoyable than taking the Sentosa Express from Harbourfront.
* If the queues are long at any of the cable car stations you may not get a car to yourself. We started our journey at Harbourfront. The queue was long and our group of 4 had to share with another group of 4. Not as enjoyable when you don't have the car to yourself.*"
,,Very good,5.0,,"Definitely worth trying. I went for the package deal with entrance to Sea aquarium. I thought it was quite expensive as it cost me 71SGD or 40GBP. It’s unlimited rides with the cable car. This takes you to mount Faber and also Sentosa. There are great views and good pics that can be taken while on the cable car. I was lucky and twice had an empty car to myself. So didn’t have to make people feel uncomfortable with my pics.
The cable cars are quite frequent and you don’t have to wait for long.
Definitely recommend"
,,Fantastic views of Singapore,4.0,,We took the return cable car ride that included Mt Faber and Sentosa lines. It is an enjoyable way to see vistas of Singapore. It is a good 2+ hour activity where you cover major parts of Mt Faber and Sentosa.
,,"If you are going to Santosa or Universal, fun ride for all",5.0,,"very safe and convenient ride to Santosa or Universal. If you are traveling with kids, please do take this. it will be a memorable visit. highly recommended."
,,A trip that will leave you on a high,4.0,,"The visit to Sentosa island starts with this cable car ride.
Pre tickets prevents the line up on top of the mountain, with short waiting time to enter cable car.
Great experience and views over bay and looking down on cruise ship docked.. The second cable car on the island takes you to the beach area and main entertainment."
,,It was good!,5.0,,The ticketing was quite confusing and we ended up buying two add on attraction tickets which even though are dirt cheap i don't recommend you do! The attraction/ buffet was poor. The cable car was great and we enjoyed it. I saw the meals going in the cars for the night events and they didn't look impressive .
,,Interesting,3.0,,Our views may be tainted as we have done the Rain Forests Cairns and Table Top Capetown. Just seemed to be in the wrong place unless you like container ships. We did not do the full trip as got a bit bored. Saw Dolphins in the theme park. I think the idea is to stop off at the other attractions rather than views.
,,for the fun,4.0,,Take the cable car in order to have an airview of the city and Santosa islands.These islands are less quite than previously.
,,Amazing,5.0,,WOW it was so much fun we travelled on this cable car to universal studios and the aquarium the cable car had to be the best part of the day definitely a must do
,,Pre book your taxi,4.0,,"A lovely way to get down to Sentosa, which appears to have changed beyond all recognition over the past few years. Getting back to the hotel though can be a very long wait for a taxi, Might be advisable to book it by phone."
,,Good Views,4.0,,"We purchased the cable ride with our tickets for Universal Studio's so we got a discount. We had a all day pass, so we made use of the cable cars."
,,WOW!!,5.0,,"I have never been on such an amazing cable car, the views are awesome over Sentosa Island and around the bay where thousands of ships come and go. This is a must do in Singapore."
,,I exciting ride,5.0,,"The Cable car is an exciting ride with magnificent views. The ride is in sections which take you up the mountain, then back across the harbour to Sentosa Island. Views include the harbour and surrounds and great views of Sentosa Island."
,,Mt Faber cable car,5.0,,The Mt Faber to Santosa Island cable car is a fun way to kick off a day at Santosa Island. The cable car views are pretty good and it is safe and clean also.
,,Very nice view,5.0,,"Took the cable car from Mount Faber to Sentosa, Arrived there by taxi. Stopover was in world trade center. After the Sentosa visit I returned, fortunately I was warned by a colleague, to leave the cable car in the WTC, as it is difficult to enter a taxi on Mount Faber, as this is a ""lonely"" place. Good advice."
,,Nice views and trip to Sentosa,4.0,,"Like everything in Singapore, quite expensive if you include the additional SEA Aquarium trip as a package...Not sure this turned out much cheaper. You have unlimited rides back and forth on a few stations. We shared one trip with a small group of french travellers who couldnt stop chatting - no big deal.

We couldnt be bothered coming back to downtown Singapore by cable car so took a cab - which was quicker and cooler. The tickets are a set price as there is no one way ticket available."
,,Superb cable car,5.0,,There are two cable cars which connects inside Sentosa island. The view is mesmerizing. There is hardly any waiting. The entry point for taking cable is bit tricky. From Harbour front MRT station its quite far and not directly connected although its walking distance. Sentosa train station is near MRT station but cable car starting point is few buildings away. Its recommended.
,,Splendid view. Mind-blowing,5.0,,"Six destinations(Harborfront, MountFabor, Santosa and another 3). You can start the journey from any place. Ususlly people start from HarbourFront. You can go to each station and get down and stay as much as you want, then get on to another car and goto the next station. You can go to each station only ones.

$35 for adults and $25 for kids. Super and extraordinary view. Mind-blowing. The time between each station in cable car will be 10mins roughly."
,,what loveley views,5.0,,we managed to travel on all the cable cars with such great views really nice to see parts of singapore from above
,,Disappointing Attitude,1.0,,WE wanted to travel to Sentosa via the Cable Car and walk back to Vivo City but they wouldn't allow us or anybody to buy a single ticket - you had to buy a return ticket and that's all they would sell. Well they missed out.
,,Fun ride,5.0,,Must take the two-way ride when visiting Sentosa. It is fun and you can get down at any stop and board from any.
,,Very enjoyable,4.0,,"Unlike some reviewers, i found that as it was quiet, I only shared 1 of my 3 journeys with another person. The views were great and really demonstrated that singapore is a major port and sentosa is singapore’s blackpool!"
,,Good cabins,3.0,,"Smooth ride, well maintained, good direction displays, staff helping, good ambience. Really liked by whole family."
,,Amazing views all the way from Faber Peak to Sentosa Island,4.0,,we took a taxi to the top to catch the cable car from Faber Peak over to Sentosa island. what an amazing view! stopping off at the shopping centre station along the way - the cable car was a smooth and gentle ride with amazing views! It was just he two of us in the cable car so that was nice to get to share that experience together as a couple and not be crammed in like sardines as we had experienced at other places. would highly recommend getting to Sentosa via the cable car! its a great view of all of the exciting things that Sentosa Island has to offer!
,,Not comfortable and not exciting,3.0,,"Not a fan of the cable car. The views are OK, but nothing spectacular. I have ridden a number of cable cars around the world and this is my least favorite so far. First they try to cram the cars full and insisted we get in with other people making it uncomfortable and hard to look around. There is also no AC in the cars and the fans there were not working making it even less comfortable. Given the price I have higher expectations. We paid over $18 USD per person. We actually opted out from riding it back even though our tickets were round trip as it was just not a nice experience."
,,Beautiful View,5.0,,I don't like heights but I am so glad I went. The views were amazing. Sentoza Island has a free monorail to take you from place to place. The beaches are perfect- white sand and palm trees and beach bars!
,,A Good way to see the whole city,5.0,,We booked tickets to cover the whole route available and had a great time looking down on all the amazing buildings and leisure spaces. Well worth doing.
,,Day trip on the cable car and meal,5.0,,Hi booked with klook we got to the cable car in Singapore I ad my booking paperwork but when we got tgeir I adnt opened it so they cudnt access so they said cud I get my email on my phone but after several attempts cudnt the staff came over asked for my email and after several attempts and over a hour did it on their phones got my email opened it and then we ad our meal and ride so thank you so much to the staff
,,"Excellent service, and the views from above are impressive.",5.0,,"The service is efficient, frequent and excellent. Every aspect of the service is fast, and we'd recommend a day ticket to gain maximum benefit from use of both lines. The individual cable cars are in excellent condition, so visibility (and photography) is not impaired by dirty or scratched glass. The views ""aloft"" are comparable to the Singapore Flyer, and there is plenty of opportunity to get some spectacular (and memorable) images, both still and video. A ""must consider"" if visiting Singapore!"
,,Too dear,2.0,,"$35 return for a few minutes. Went for the $4return monorail trip instead. I read numerous reviews prior to our decision; yes the view would be great, but at a cost of $70 for both of us?"
,,Excellent.,5.0,,Sentosa is a paradise and with many things to do; It is a beautiful tropical island you most go. Must see.
,,Expensive way to get to Sentosa Island.,3.0,,"Looks good if you like this sort of thing, but You get better views from Skypark. And you can do this trip by local bus for £1 with free return."
,,Good way to see the harbour and the skyline,4.0,,Went for the views from the cable car which were very good altho not cheap (£35 for 2) Sentosa itself seemed very dated and overdue a facelift but the gardens at Faber Peak are lovely
,,Very good 10-15 minutes ride to Sentosa island !!!,5.0,,The Singapore cable car is one of the probably best ways to travel between Faber Peak and Sentosa Island. It was established way back in 1974. It is Singapore's first and only cableway. The cable car ride is one of the highlights for any tourist coming to Singapor. There are more than 100 cabins spanning across 5 kms on the Mount Faber Line and the Sentosa Line. A joyride on the Cable Car offers one of the best 360 degrees aerial view of the entire Sentosa island and the resort. It operates from 8.45am to 10pm. Strongly recommend atleast one ride on the cable car for the overall view and experience !
,,Lovely,5.0,,Really a great experience. The view from the cable car is really breathtaking. A must do activity if you are heading towards Sentosa.
,,Well worth doing,5.0,,We visited Sentosa island via the cable car system and it was a great choice. Built in 2014 all of the cable cars are in great condition and for most of the time my wife and I had our own cable car. The staff were very friendly and assisted with every requirement we had. My tip book over booking dot com and receive discounts (we paid only 49 Singapore Dollars for two people)
,,Incredible view,4.0,,"We took the cable car to go to Sentosa island. The gondola lift took us on a breath taking trip over the bay into Sentosa. The view was awe inspiring. It was a spectacular sight to see the Singapore landscape and a bird's eye view of the Sentosa island.
As it was 2 pm the sun was blazing. Inside the cable car, it was stifling. Wish there was AC."
,,Fun in Heights,5.0,,"If u love heights this is a must try, from above u could see the beautiful singapore, truly exciting, used cable car to maount faber to sentosa"
,,A fun way to sight see,4.0,,You can take this modern Cable Car all the way up to Mount Faber Peak and obtain great views of the vast docks and South Coast of the main island. You can then return via your starting point to Sentosa Island and enjoy all that's on offer there.
,,Great way to see part of the City,5.0,,"Having walked to Mount Faber park (gorgeous walk but a little hot and sticky from humidity) this was the perfect way to see more of the city and take us over to Sentosa.
Easy and simple to use, well worth getting the full trip ticket as you can hop off at each stop if you want or simply continue on round.

Stunning views on a clear day."
,,This is an amazing trip!,5.0,,"One ticket covers quite a lot, so taking a few trips back and forth in the cable car, is a good investment! you can buy a cheap ticket on klook.com, they answer all emails too. :)"
,,Ticketing system is poor,1.0,,"I purchased a ticket for the cable car to go from mount father to Sentosa from the Sentosa online store. I received an electronic ticket which includes tickets for the aquarium and universal studios. I got off the train at harbour front and took a tiresome walk up to mount Faber. At the ticket counter I’m told I can’t redeem my ticket at the ticket kiosk.
I’m very disappointed, I’m told to go back to harbour front to redeem my ticket and there’s apparently small print on my ticket that says to do so.
Very poor instructions and the ticket seller made no effort to assist me.
Not impressed"
,,World's first harbour aerial ropeway !,5.0,,"This cable car system was the first in the world to be constructed to span a harbour, which simply makes it a must see item. It was well worth the trip and it allows you to incorporate a visit to Sentosa island, where you have the opportunity to travel on another cable car line as well as the many other activities the island has to offer. Its a clean, well run service that I highly recommend."
,,Nice city view,5.0,,Excellent view from the cable car.Must have experience. You can explore Sentosa using the cable car. It is well organized and the service was good
,,Unique thrilling experience and beautiful surroundings,5.0,,It was an unique thrilling experience of riding by a cable car. We bought round tickets which helped us to explore many stations on ground including Sentosa island. There are many attractions at each of the stations including restaurants and tourists’ facilities. Beautiful picturesque surroundings and one can take lot of photos for remembrance. We thoroughly enjoyed the cable car ride.
,,Day out,4.0,,"This is a ""must do"" while in Singapore but allow yourself at least a half a day, there is so much to see and do. The views from the cable cars are amazing. Get off at each stop and have a look around. When you get to Sentosa take the time to have a good look around. (There is a water park and a mini theme park , if you are going to either of these give yourself a full day)"
,,Good views of Singapore,3.0,,Easy to access from the harbour beside the cruise centre. There are several stops but not all are worth getting off at. The view is great and it gives a different perspective of the city. It’s interesting if you are in the vicinity or want to escape the heat.
,,Amazing experience dining here!,5.0,,"A really different idea! We went at six for a glass of bubbles and had a quirky, romantic, delicious meal whilst we were watching the sunset from our private cable car. Magical!"
,,Was a lovely trip but better in the daytime,3.0,,"Was very confusing to find where to catch it from outside Universal Studios , We asked so many people walking around and no one knew. We asked some ground staff and got the run around time and time again. Finally we got there and with 5 min to spare before the closing time. We did it at night .
Will go back again one day when we visit Singapore but do in the daytime
Kids would love this too."
,,Be sure to get a discount if you are a Singaporean!,4.0,,"DBS and POSB card holders get tickets at fifty percent off. All their tickets are for round trips, and valid for the Mount Faber and Sentosa lines. Really very stuffy in the cable car. Wish the fans were stronger. Their staff ought to be more enthusiastic and increase interaction with visitors to enhance overall experience for visitors."
,,Love'in it!,5.0,,a nice mean of commuting to santosa island. Loved the ride and the panoramic views one can enjoy throughout traveling from one phase to another.
,,Great View,5.0,,We chose the harbourfront then Mount Faber back to harbourfront then Sentosa Line cause ive read somewhere it has the most scenic view. And yes they were right. We alight at Sentosa then headed to Universal Studios.
,,I liked it,4.0,,"We decided to take the longer ride from Mount Faber and it was worth the view going into Sentosa,We got late so missed the return journey which we wanted to see how the city looks One should take it"
,,Up in the clouds,4.0,,One of the easy ways to get to Sentosa and cheap. The views back to Singapore will keep you busy and entertained. Catch Cable car over and flyer back
,,Easy and convenient,4.0,,Was impressed with how easy it was to use the cable car . Tickets and information at kiosk helpful . Happy to give every couple or family their own cable so no sharing with strangers . Pleasant 10 mins with beautiful views .
,,Flying without wings,5.0,,Although expensive at S€30 for the round trip from Sentosa to Mt Faber the experience should not be missed and provides some great photo opportunities.
,,View of Singapore,5.0,,After south Africa I enjoyed cable car in Singapore. The one round trip we saw total Singapore. My son 13 year old and daughter 10 year old. For us this is first time they enjoyed lot. My wife Daily talk about this Amazing Trip.
,,Cable ride good,4.0,,The cable car was good but Santosa Island was awful. They could have done a lot better. The beaches are good but the amusement park did not match what the island should be
,,Memorable Experience,5.0,,"if you have a short stay, still you want to enjoy the city then, cable care is one of the best ways to see and enjoy the city. you see the whole city from heights. everyone should try the cable car for sure if you are in Singapore for the first time."
,,Beautiful but too long to queue,3.0,,"It is such a magnificent ride , unfortunately it is not managed properly and so the queuing system is totally mismanaged and children find it very difficult to manage this especially during humid months."
,,Great views,4.0,,We got tickets on klook site which were a lot cheaper than walk up prices and voucher was easy to exchange. Cable cars were a great way to visit Sentosa Island and the views are really nice. We were lucky and they were not crowded as we did go quite early and you could see the queues getting longer later in the day. Great way to see Sentosa also as the ticket includes a trip on there also.
,,Amazing Views,4.0,,We took cable car to Santosa Island just for the view and were not disappointed. Cable car is air conditioned.Can be busy and takes I think up to 8 people.
,,It is worth the trip to Sentosa island.,4.0,,"We were on holiday amd for a ride to Sentosa island and if you are visiting Singapore the cable car is a ""must do"" trip. If you really want to go wild you could take the VIP dinner ride a night as well."
,,Best done during the day.,3.0,,"You can pay $35 to get access to Mount Faber on the main island and to get over to Sentosa island and then all the stops on Sentosa island. Or if you don’t particularly want to use the other stops on Sentosa and are happy to walk around you can save yourself $2 which doesn’t make much sense!
Make sure you go earlier in the day as at night you can’t necessarily see much of the scenery below or into the distance. Especially the trip to Mount Faber is not worth it at night.
We only did it as we’d paid to use both lines."
,,Great views from the Gondola,5.0,,Great way to see Sentosa it cost $35 dollars per person the gondolas are air conditioned views amazing.
,,Harmless Fun & A Grest Way To Sentosa,4.0,,"This is a must do. There are two main cable cars plus a myriad of other offerings. It is the best way to see the Merlion and the airconditioned comfort of your gondola is a great way to beat the heat. We had gondolas to ourselves all day, not sure it would be as much fun if they filled up with the maximum eight people."
,,A good view of the surroundings,4.0,,"Worth a round trip if Sentosa is in your schedule . Youll get an amazing view ,its either $35 or $38 if im correct and for the latter youll get the full round tour of all 3 cable cars. If you are just after a view, Mt Faber wil suffice."
,,Views,4.0,,"A lovely way to get to Sentosa island with lovely views, queues Went down quite quickly, pods take up to 6 people"
,,Too expensive,3.0,,"Ridiculously priced at $35 dollars each, plus we wanted to go to the aquarium so we were charged $71 each. If we’d been more astute we could have bought the aquarium tickets online for a lot less and travelled on the cheaper monorail to the aquarium. You live and learn."
,,Top Ride,5.0,,"This is the best way to get into and out of Sentosa Island, the view is just magnificent. Good for kids"
,,great view,5.0,,"a great view over Singapore and lots of happy memories. I proposed to my wife in the cable car and she said yes. We've been in the cable car multiple times after, we still enjoy it"
,,Cable car ride,5.0,,"A different way to view Singapore, ride to the top and disembark, or stay in the comfortable gondola for the return trip. Spectacular views."
,,Everyone love cable car,4.0,,"From a kid, I love cable car, but Singapore's is a bit expensive and shorter ride as compared to many area in Asia. We found a cheaper way is to buy a family membership. Same price as a cable car ride but can use for 1 full year. So good options if you want to come with your family."
,,nice and comfortable,4.0,,"not cheap, to be honest but worth the money! one can step out and walk around the forest park with lots of food/drink"
,,Love the Cable Car,4.0,,Best way to visit Sentosa . Great views from the cars and you feel very safe . Even our mum at 82 enjoyed it
,,"Wonderful Experience, beautiful view of Singapore.",5.0,,"Love the cable car, very comfortable to sit and enjoy the views as you get across to Sentosa. A must do when in Singapore, you can take some beautiful photos from up there."
,,Best way to sentosa,5.0,,You can take car to sentosa but this is more fantastic. The wiev is wonderful in cable car. There is some stops on it. You should lesrn where you go in sentosa before tou take cable car.
,,wonderful experience with my family,5.0,,Never miss this opportunity when in Singapore.. my family and i rode this initially during the day and on our return trip at night.. see the wonderful scenery
,,Nice way to get to Sentosa,4.0,,Nice way to get to Sentosa and to see the island from above. Birds eye views of the harbour. Lots of stops where you can get off and explore.
,,Great views,4.0,,A little more expensive since our last visit to Singapore but always a worth the time and money. Pick a clear day if you plan to go on the cable car.
,,Great way to Sentosa,5.0,,A great way to get to Sentosa. Great views! doesn't feel like you up in the air. The cable car ride is smooth.
,,Dinner,5.0,,"A lovely end to the first day of our honeymoon. We booked this a couple months in advance. You're greeted by friendly staff, who explain how the evening will work. Then you are offered a drink to start off with, we went for champagne. You have a car to yourself and start off with the first 2 courses. We opted for the non-vegetarian option. Our starters were mushroom soup and slices of duck. Each circle of the loop is 30mins. When you get back to the beginning, the waiters are waiting with the next course and your choice of wine. We had beef and vegetables. The beef was melt-in-the mouth tender and the vegetables crunchy. To my liking anyway. The meal was delivered hot. The last course, i have no idea what it was but boy it was enjoyable. The whole experience takes 90mins. Three loops in all. Highly recommend this dinner. The food is very enjoyable and the staff very friendly. You are given an evaluation form to fill in. That easy to do and my only comment was on how to improve the experience. That was to start the trip at 6.30pm, so you could have the last loop seeing the sites in the dark. It was lovely to see the sun going down. The views were great but not the best of Singapore. I do highly recommend this experience for an early night out."
,,Have to do it,4.0,,"We stayed on Sentosa so figured may as well pay the big bucks and cable back home, we knew the price so was prepared, location in tower 2 at HarbourFront had me lost for 30 mins but once I found it, straight forward and a different perspective on the harbour and Sentosa"
,,Go to Sentosa by cable car!,5.0,,The views of Singapore and Sentosa from cable car are absolutely breathtaking! You can see everything! The water is so clear and the trip is a MUST for those going to the aquarium or universal studios! You won’t regret it!
,,Breathtaking view,5.0,,A very romantic and a leisure ride to reach Sentosa. Has all the elements of travelling to the island of fun .
,,EXHILARATING EXPERIENCE. A MUST DO.,5.0,,"During our stay in Singapore we went on the Cable Car which took us to Mount Faber and especially Santosa Island.
We purchased the $55 dollar special deal. This gave us unlimited rides and entry to two Attractions. In the cable car you had the best views of this area you would want to see.
Just breathtaking views and overall a photographers delight. I know i took over 100 photos and some videos.
There is even a massive waterpak as one of the attractions.
There are far too many to list.
We went to the Butterfly Exhibit and this was wonderful. Highly Recommended. They even have bugs from giant rhino bugs right down to deadly spiders alive and on display. The scorpions made me look twice. All sizes and shapes.
The second exhibit was the Massive Merlion. A three minute video on his history than in and up you go in the lift to the 10th floor gives you access to the lookout on his head and the lookout in his mouth. Stunning views and photo opportunities from both lookouts.
This is Highly Recommended.
The entry tickets also allow you to ride the Mono Rail between different locations.
Overall this RIDE IS A MUST DO AND HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
,,great attraction,5.0,,this goes to santosa island with loads to do and see great day out great for kids especially with water parks too on hot days .
,,Excellent views,5.0,,Excellent way to travel high up with fab views and allows access to the walking paths from Mount Faber which is a steep climb up otherwise. The greenery and bird song on the walk is wonderfil
,,Great way to look at Singapore,5.0,,"We were staying on Sentosa so we took the free Bus B to Siloso beach and went to the cable car.
I had looked online and booked the tickets in advance using a different booking site and got the tickets significantly cheaper than buying them at the cable car entrance.
The views of Singapore were great travelling over to the Mainland and back.
We walked around Mount Faber, which is well worth doing, and the views are superb.
Worth the money for the views alone"
,,Cable car to Setong,5.0,,"I took the cable car at Mount Faber until Setong Island. There was no lines, so I could go on a car on my own. Nice trip, takes approximately 20 minutes from Mount Faber to Setong."
,,great experience with amazing views,5.0,,To ride on the cable car was our main reason for visiting Sentosa Island. It didn't disappoint. We did also visit the Aquarium which was wonderful.
,,High above Sentosa Island,4.0,,From off of Sentosa Island to going to Sentosa Station to Beach Point it a really nice ride. Little expensive but what not in Singapore. You can walk or take the train on the island but you are here to enjoy your day.
,,Simply Amaging!!!,4.0,,"Undoubtly it's an amaging experiance. If any one wants to go to santosa island or universal studio, must avail the cable car. You will definitely enjoy when it will go over the sea. While after sunset some may find it quite scarry, because it be all around dark; specially when paasing over the sea. Overall I will strongly recomend it to all."

,,Be Certain to Visit the Bathroom,5.0,,"My friends told me I had to visit the bathrooms at the Mt Faber end of the cable cars. And I did.

I am not going to spoil it for you by telling you what I saw. Just go. They are on the ground floor in the building where you buy your tickets.

I'm sure everyone else who writes reviews about this cable experience will tell you it's terrific, because it is.

Go to the bathrooms!!!."
,,Great view and definitely do this if visiting Sentosa,5.0,,We made the most of our pass for the day and also went on the other gondola on Santosa Island. Allocate enough time to see as much as you can and recommend returning back at night to see the amazing view with the night light.

,,Excellent ride,5.0,,"The ride on the cable car in Singapore is really excellent, smooth and enjoyable. The views of Singapore from the cable car are fantastic."
,,Cable Car @ Singapore,5.0,,"Singapore cable car has its terminal at Harbourfront , accessible using MRT. The cable car has 2 routes. One connecting Mount Faber with Sentosa and the other line is on the Sentosa Island resort spanning across 3 stations. The 2 lines are connected at Imbiah Lookout station.
The cable cars have comfortable seating and good viewing arrangement. Considering its high-rise route, wonderful views are on offer, especially of the bay area. Tickets can be purchased on date of travel or online advance booking.

,,Beautiful view from top,5.0,,Sentosa Island is a very beautiful place & the view from cable car is adding extra attraction. It provides brief introduction of Sentosa Island from top.
,,"Wow, what great views",5.0,,"Whilst enjoying a day at Sentosa Island we jumped on the Cable car and enjoyed a great lunch with a few cool Tigers at Mt Faber. The Singapore Cable Cars gives you a completely different view of parts of Singapore overlooking the harbor. The staff and service at Mt Faber was outstanding and i recommend the ""Bangers & Mash"" which was outstanding."
,,"A Wonderful way to visit Sentosa-- with ""Amazing Aerial Views"".",4.0,,"This Cable car system links Singapore with this ""compact island"" with many interesting attractions-- Sentosa- located off the South Shore. The system started operating 45 years ago-- and has had several upgrades and redesigns as the demand, and technology, evolved. The ""ride"" takes about 15 minutes-- and the views of Sentosa Island, ""Mount Faber"", Vivo City and Marina Bay and Environs are super!! It also connects with the transit system on Sentosa Island. TripAdvisor has designated this attraction the highly respected ""Traveller's Choice"" award. It is indeed very worthy of the award.

I hope that this Review has been helpful."
,,Nice views but expensive,4.0,,"Offers a great alternative getting into Sentosa. Views of the straits are spectacular and is a fun mode of transport. It is pricey, but we included this as part of our HIPPO pass"
,,aerial view,5.0,,"took the cable car to go to Sentosa island. Its not a cheap ride and you cannot do one way,only round trip fare and the cable car closes by 9:30pm . Make sure you return or have to take the train back."
,,only way to go to santosa !!,5.0,,wonderful ride from the moutain top to Santosa...stunning views of the the city and Santosa Island..
,,Best during sunset,4.0,,"Best timing to take the cable car is around sunset. You can enjoy the amazing view en-route Sentosa island. However, I feel the cable car station in Harbourfront is located a bit far or quite distant from the MRT station. Gets confusing to find out the station for tourists/people not from Singapore"
,,Awesome,5.0,,"Awesome views, good ride so much to see. Great value for money and a ride to remember. Very clean and secure."
,,Singapore Cable Car -A Fabulous Experience!,5.0,,My Husband and I experienced the most fabulous ride with the Singapor Cable Car. We were served a multi-course dinner with wine and the food and ambience was wonderful from the beginning to the end. It was so beautiful to to see the sunset and travel across Singapore! A must to do!
,,Exhilarating,5.0,,"We are cable car junkies to some degree. The cable car ride to Sentosa island ride did not disappoint. The facilities to and from as with the cars themselves were very clean and efficient. You get 2 round-trip rides with one ticket - one going over the water with an excellent view of the freight harbor and docks in distance, and one across the Sentosa island at about 20 feet above palm tree tops level. It is different than the Swiss Alps type of scenery, and the glass bottom ones of HK Lantau Island going to the Big Buddha ( a bit more thrilling due to the 100% glass. Our grandchildren got the biggest buzz and joy out of it."
,,Lovely View from the Cable Car,5.0,,"We took the cable car from Mount Faber till Sentosa. I was with my children aged 4 and 8yrs and they absolutely loved the experience. right from sitting in a moving cable car to seeing a whole lot of Singapore and the Sea to getting off at Sentosa, the ride was awesome."
,,Good experience,5.0,,Must do. Mount faber peak is beautiful. Amazing view of singapore harbor. Mount faber peak is beautiful for taking some amazing picture.
,,Awesome!,5.0,,"You absolutely must take this! The views are amazing. The city will look like a toy city and particularly fun for kids. To get into Sentosa, take this instead of the train. Thank me later."
,,interesting view on the way up,3.0,,I wouldn't put it at the top of your list... It is a little out of the way as you need to get to it from the old Harbor front mall. The cars are not air conditioned either. There is not really much to do at the top. Best to do it first thing in the morning before it gets too hot.
,,A must for your first visit to Sentosa,5.0,,Offer unrivalled views from Mt Fabsr down to Sentosa - superb photos can be taken. You get great views as you approach the island. If you buy the full ticket you can also use the other cable car on the island & ride the monorail.
,,Best way to visit Sentosa Island,5.0,,We used the Rope way to reach Sentosa Island and it was a great experience. Very fascinating scenery as you go down the Hill and reach Sentosa Island. View of the Island and various Water Parks below was quite mesmerizing.

,,Great way to get to Sentosa,5.0,,"This is the best way to get to Sentosa. Amazing views. There are two places to get on, we went from Mt Fabour to get the full trip. Unfortunately they only sell return tickets. It would be good to go one way and then taxi back from Sentosa"
,,Great view,5.0,,"Very well run, scenic and impressive. Not cheap though. I found it easy and no queues despite being quite a busy holiday period"
,,Scenic view Cable car,5.0,,Singapore Santosa cable car has two routes cable car which provides all of scenery of Singapore near seaside. Nearly every visitor take the rides of this cable car and enjoy photography.
,,Breathtaking views and worth every cent,5.0,,"It is definitely a thrilling way to transport to Sentosa Island by cable car. The cable car moves off to high above the harbor and it was frightening at first because the sea level was so far away from me. I was having mixed emotions of feeling scared yet the view is spectacular and feeling better after the cable car is declining. The trip was quite a short one that lasts me about 10-20 mins. I will come back again.

Tips for your reference: It can be cheaper to get the tickets from a third-party website."
,,honeymoon 2.0,5.0,,"awesome views, special moment for me and my wife. would recommend for couples for a romantic sight seeing of singapore"
,,Two way journey,3.0,,"This is a good way to get to Sentosa, the Metlion and back. There is no single ticket so if you only want a one way it will cost you 33Singapore Dollars, not too bad for a return journey"
,,nice touch,5.0,,Sentosa island can be reached by road but the cable cars are definately the way to go. You get sweeping views of the city and can use your passes when on the island too. excellent
,,A thrilling ride over Singapore Harbor,5.0,,The Singapore Cable Car is a thrilling way to reach Sentosa Island. The cable car runs high above the harbor and at one point actually goes through the middle of a tall building.
,,A must try while in Singapore,5.0,,This cable car is definitely a must try option. A wide view of Singapore along with Sentosa Island and port view also
,,Fine Dinning evening,5.0,,We had a fine dinning evening where we had a three course meal and wine travailing in the cable car. after each complete circuit we were had a starter +Dinner + Dessert and in the back round a thunder storm . A great night out
,,Amazing,5.0,,"The views are fantastic we went over to Fort Silosa, a day I will never forget, Beautifully preserved Lest we Forget."
,,Great view,4.0,,We enjoyed travelling across to Sentosa on the Cable Car. It has fantastic views of both Singapore and Sentosa Island. We would have returned on it also however there was a storm so we caught the train. It's definitely worth doing across to Sentosa as...More
,,Great views,5.0,,"Great views to be had and worth every cent. Took off from Harbour front to Mount Faber. Had time to spend at Mount Faber first, then took another back again to Sentosa via Harbour Front. Good thing was they gave each group/family their own cable...More"
,,great way of getting to the island,5.0,,"This was a highlight as the view is terrific and you can see the whole island. The island its self is a giant theme park and the only interesting part i found was the history of the old forts, apart from that i couldn’t wait...More"

,,Stunning Views,5.0,,"Last here in 1983 an amazing changing landscape was to be expected, however I could not have imagined the transformation. The whole harbour area transformed from a dry dock to soaring apartment blocks overlooking a swimming pool. No better way to see it all than...More"
,,Cable car,4.0,,What a nice way to see the huge city of Singapore. We had a round trip and lookes around at all stations.
,,Great views,5.0,,"A wonderful way to get a different view of Singapore. Treat yourself to doing this if you are heading to Sentosa. Well priced and well organised. Frequent crossings mean you don’t have long to wait,"
,,Worth The Experience,5.0,,"Travel across the harbour, across the river, across thew freeway to Sentosa island, this magnificent sky-way experience is worth the trouble of getting there. Just make sure you are facing forward not backwards because you'll get a sore neck."
,,Part of the Fun Pass,5.0,,My family loved our ride in the Cable Car. We traveled from Sentosa Island to the mall for lunch. It was a great afternoon with spectacular views.
,,Mt. Faber cable car towards sentosa,4.0,,I will rate this experience as good and one time experience. For this you also have a waiting time of around 45 minutes. You can save that time by going through road as well. But if you want to enjoy the scenic view of sentosa and it’s neighbourhood you can take one way cable car. It is hardly of 10-15 minutes ride but you could be able to see many beautiful things from this ride
,,Birds eye view!,5.0,,Great view of the city and an excellent perspective of Sentosa. Fantastic to see the sharks in the water park from above!
,,It's a fun way to go to Sentosa,5.0,,"I took the hike up to Mt. Faber (easy hike). Cable car is really worth doing once. If you want to go by yourself, just tell attendant. They are very accommodating."
,,Must visit to have bird's-eye view of Singapore and Sentosa,4.0,,"I took 4 ways cable car. It was awesome experience. Got bird's-eye view of entire Sentosa and key attractions of Singapore. I suggest one should take 4 way cable car route instead of 2 ways. Ideally one should visit around 5-5.30pm. So one can visit part of cable car in day time and partly after sunset and get both day and night view. I did same. As view from cable car was very good I skipped Singapore flyer. Only negative feedback was, we were asked to change cable car in middle of trip as staff wanted to use our cable car for candle lite dinner for other couple. We had to take out our kids, stroller and luggage from one cable car and rushed to another cable car. It dampened our overall experience. Else entire journey was very good."
,,Amazing experience,4.0,,Today I had the chance for a round trip on the cable car.. my kids enjoyed a lot .. they really wanted to go again .. the joyful I saw in them .. can not be expressed in pages and pages .. wish u all the best
,,Poorly Organized,1.0,,If it’s a clear calm day stay away from this zoo of a ride that entices you with the convenience of online ticket purchase but then requires you to que up to collect tickets in the same line with all those looking for information and buying tickets while under utilized staff stand by.
,,Hair raising,5.0,,"If heights are not your thing then avoid this one...the first time you go out of the tower into the void is amazing ,but the views soon dispell any fear.Next time try the dinner flights!!"
,,Great fun ride for visitors and kids alike,4.0,,highly recommended at least once every 5-10 years to enjoy the trip to Sentosa on a slow afternoon! The view is fantastic. The other alternate is the cable ride within Sentosa itself.
,,Sitting on top of the world!,4.0,,We had the chance to experience the Singapore Cable Car on our trip to Sentosa Island to visit Universal Studios. The wait in line was not long at all. We were able to experience a great 360 degree view of the surrounding area. Seeing the Merlion from there was great. Hong Kong has cable cars too but the experience in Singapore was has a breath taking!
,,amazing,5.0,,"This is a must if your visiting Singapore, so well organised and amazing views we had a ticket that gave us the option to hop on and hop off whenever we wanted to, the trip to Sentosa island is fantastic, such a beautiful place beaches are stunning and then you have universal studios, what a great day out no matter what age"
,,Yes! Do it!,5.0,,It is a charming option to reach Santosa. Both interesting and educational if you have a map with you. Great for families or a business traveler relaxing.
,,So pleased we took this trip in the cable car. The views were magnificant,5.0,,The views give you an appreciation of this small but busy place. Staff were friendly - ride was smooth and cameras are a must to capture the sites
,,Beautiful View of Singapore,4.0,,Great experience to see how beautiful Singapore is while riding in Cable Car. Dont miss this on your travel list.
,,Must do when in Singapore,5.0,,Absolutely beautiful views. A must do. Buy your ticket on Trip Advisor it’s 1/2 the price as buying at the ticket counter and better price than the combos. Just buy a few hours before you go. The ride is comfortable and breathtaking. I recommend everyone do it. Relaxing.
,,Such a Great View,5.0,,An amazing view of Sentosa and well maintained with nice staff. Definitely a must-do if you’re into sightseeing.
,,ONE of best ways to Santos!,5.0,,You can catch a bus or cab to the cable car. Great photos and takes approximately 30 min. You can see the lay out of Santos. I would recommend a full day pass so you are able to move between the cable car's once you are there.
,,Beautiful place and well maintained.,5.0,,Beautiful place and well maintained. We visited Santosa Island.. Exceptional good. Must visit place in Singapore
,,fantastic views,5.0,,This is a great little ride taking you across to Santosa. You can spend a few hours there in the gardens and the Merlion
,,Up Up and Away,5.0,,What a wonderful way to get to Sentosa Island. Going through the building is interesting. If you want to catch a cab back to your hotel you need to get off at Faber Peak. Great fun.
,,it's allright,3.0,,"If you have done skiing in Europe or elsewhere, you are very used to use this kind of cable cars. I was not impressed by this one. It was promoted as a beautiful view.
To me it's not so special, im sorry. Sentosa it attached to the commercial port of Singapore, and I'm not interested in seeing douzens of tankers waiting to dock.
It's also terribly expensive. To me it was just a fancy way to move from A to B, and it cost a pretty penny as i was with my family and friends. In my opinion it is not a worth entertaintment for a family"
,,Singapore Cable Car,4.0,,"Excellent!! You get a round ticket for around $25 then can get on and off at each station once. Closest MRT is Harbour Front. Plenty to see for free or plenty of adventures to be had for $$.

NB: Don’t buy electronic tickets as you have to them redeem them at the ticket window for a paper ticket anyway. I purchased mine through here (Viator/Trip Advisor) however the ticket office didn’t recognise the barcode. I had to ring Viator and request for a different form of barcode. Bit of a hassle."
,,Great method to get around,5.0,,The cable car is a great way to get around some of the best tourist spots in Singapore. You have great views over the island to the South and the cost is very reasonable.
,,Beautiful View of Singapore,4.0,,Riding on the cable car is one of the special experience. You get a 360° View from a great height. Watching the city with River view while riding towards the Sentosa Island is just amazing. Must have this experience
,,Phenomenal Views,3.0,,"We visited on Sunday, to access Sentosa for the day. Very very busy, don’t bother to access from Faber Point, lots of coach trips and the queues were massive, with the staff manning the cars themselves more interested with their phones than their jobs.
Access is better from Harbour Front, no queues and if you want to take in the views go up from there to Faber Point and don’t get off, just stay in the car for a round trip.
We purchased a day pass for 2 adults, so we could jump on and off through the day and evening (views are phenomenal at night)
Views are breathtaking, it feels really safe and is really clean. 8 people to a car, but we never had more than 4 on any trip.
Well worth doing, recommended!"
,,Absolutely terrific !,5.0,,"While visiting the Universal Studio you have several options at Vivo City . Monorail, Broadwalk or cable car . The last one is the best . The charges are 30$ but it is actually priceless as you travel in that glass covered car and travel from the highest pick and have a wonderful view of the undersea and few ships , also you can see the dolphins and sharks in their parks from that top view, changing the cable car several times as it is unlilimited till 9PM."
,,Quick ride Up/down to Sentosa Island,5.0,,"We had a Quick down to Sentosa island. Nice scenic view of port, the greenery below and the top view of Sentosa island. The shop also has miniature Cable car and Monorail models."
,,Nice Ride,5.0,,It was a nice ride to Santosa island in a cable car with lovely City and the sea view.But you have to wait in the Que patiently for some time till you get your cable car.It was a very nice experience and the staff at the loading point and the drop off point are very friendly and caring about you.
,,Pleasant Ride in the Evening,4.0,,"An enjoyable activity that can be done with kids.
We took a round trip ride from Harbour Front station to Sentosa during sunset. The views all around were beautiful.
Spent a couple of hours at Sentosa island. Took the cable car ride back from Sentosa to Harbour Front after dark. This also was a very good experience given that the buildings, Vivo City Mall and the various vessels in the sea are lighted up."
,,Great views!,5.0,,Did this as part of a Sentosa Island tour and it was fabulous....great views of areas you would not normally see...and a different perspective of the island and surrounds.
,,Superb Views,5.0,,We decided on taking a late afternoon trip so we could take dinner on Sentosa Island and then catch the Cable Car back for the night lights. Well worth the visit though food on Sentosa left much to be desired!
,,Sentosa island,5.0,,The cable car is a great way to see part of Singapore harbour on your way to Sentosa island friendly staff although things are a little on the expensive side...
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,Amazing experience 360 degrees super views great night view superb overviews green country side lovely memories
,,I did it..,5.0,,I am terrified of heights but I got on this. After getting over my fear the view was amazing!!! I recommend it!
,,Swingers,5.0,,This is a great way of seeing the whole of Singapore. We were unlucky to get a group on with us called the swingers. Mostly young people who take cable cars everywhere in the world moving quickly side to side make the car swing. It wasn't long before the father of young children who by now were crying got up and stopped it. No argument from them they had had they're fun. It's a long trip and great fun
,,A must attraction,5.0,,We were visiting on a cloudy/rainy day. Even so the high-ride is a great experience with beautiful views of this part of Singapore. I can just imagine how it looks on a sunny or partly cloudy day! There are also great views on some of the attractions in the Santosa Island. We purchesed the unlimited rides tiket and went few times with the second local cable-car waiting for some sunshine to get out. Anyway going up to Faber Hill supposed to lead us to that trail with the famous bridge - but it was too rainy to hike so we took the cable-car back to base.
,,Harbour Front,4.0,,Easy to get to from Harbour Front station and use the Mount Faber line to reach Sentosa island. Comfortable and modern but a few more fans or air-con would help the journey to be more enjoyable.
,,To Sentosa Island,5.0,,The best way to get to Sentosa Island. The view of the many ships in the bay was great. There are friendly staff to assist you entering and exiting the cable cabs.
,,Unbelievable views.,4.0,,"Picked up the cable car from harbourside MTR which is well signposted when getting off the train. Lift to 15th floor then ride across to Sentosa Island. The views are amazing paramamacilly and looking down over the water, if not s little scary. The cars are large and clean. We were lucky as early in day you could travel as a couple, the crowds came later and cars were full with 8 people. We went to the beach by transferring to other cars and on way back went up to Mount Faber.
Cost 35 dollar each was not cheap but worth the views."
,,Magnificent view,5.0,,I love the view. But it could be very hot and long queue during daytime on holidays. Go for it before sunset is recommended.
,,Cool way to get to Sentosa,5.0,,"We ventured overt o Sentosa via cable car and it was easy, cable cars were clean and easy to get on and off"
,,Love the view,4.0,,The cable car was so great if you want to see Singapore from the view. There are 3 stations that you can hop in and hop off. Good experience. A relaxing one.
,,Love it!!!!,5.0,,"We were on the way to Santosa, it was getting bit darker and look at the sunset from the cable car, we love it."
,,Get the all day pass,5.0,,"An great way to both get around Sentosa island and see the sights of Mount Faber. Trust me, get the all day pass when visiting Sentosa as you will find yourself using it again and again."
,,A good trip,4.0,,"All the places visited were neat and clean. Most of the entertainment was fun, and enjoyable. Worth a visit"
,,Good Experience,4.0,,Nothing out of the ordinary but an interesting way to get to Sentosa Island. A little expensive so I wpould recommend the free rail shuttle for families
,,To & from Sentosa,5.0,,"Used the cable car to & from Sentosa & to & from Mount Faber, nothing much but eateries on Mount Faber but Sentosa is great, so much to do."
,,Nice place,4.0,,This is a nice thing to do when you are a Tourist. However the tickets are very expensive. It would be nice if the Singapore Tourism reduces the prices. It is a beautiful ride to Sentosa. Worth it. However if you are a budget traveller you can skip this one.
,,safe and secure !,5.0,,"The first time I did it was a bit tough, as I sat alone in the cubicle and during the day, views were terrifying LOL.
This time my friend and I were together and went during the night from Sentosa to the city. It wasn’t as bad as I thought it’ll be, in fact I enjoyed it.
It’s a cool ride if you can handle it."
,,Awesome experience,5.0,,"Wonderful experience while traveling in the cable car, super great technology and world's best quality"
,,Great views!,4.0,,Top views of the harbour and a great way to get to Sentosa Island. It was easy and affordable and felt very safe. Highly recommended.
,,Taking a level above,4.0,,Very good experience to see a nice chunk of Singapore from above. Prices drop after 18:00. Else would have found it expensive
,,Stunning,5.0,,"This is a great the views are incredible as you pass over the cruise ship terminal and head over to Santosa island . Get the duel pass so you can get on the island line to giant Merlion.
Pricing is high around 30nzd for round trip but worth it if you’re a little nervous with heights try it but be aware it is on of the highest cable cars . Do it at night it a whole new experience."
,,Loved it!,5.0,,"This is by far the most awesome way to get to Sentosa Island. We loved it, and you can get so many amazing photos too. Really beautiful, well-maintained cars and doesn't take long - unless you get stuck in a thunderstorm (which we did!) - then you will experience some stopping."
,,Another visit on the cable car,4.0,,"This is the original cable car, connecting Mount Faber with Sentosa via Harbourfront. Views are always good and it's fun for the kids. I have to say I'm getting a little sick of it now after too many times, but have to keep the kids happy."
,,GREAT VIEWS,4.0,,We caught the cable car across to Sentosa Island for the day. They are quite large cable cars with several stops to Sentosa. It was enjoyable to sit back and take in the views.
,,Great view!,5.0,,I like the fact that we didn't have to get off the car and saw everything we wanted to see. I love seeing Faber's peak!
,,Expensive but good views,4.0,,"We didn't pre purchase tickets so queued and paid full price including a little extra to ride the cable cars on Sentosa Island. You can get ticket packages that include some of the attractions on the Island. Sentosa Island appears to be the theme park side of Singapore with Universal Studios and waterparks etc.

The ride across is 15mins or so and the views are super. If you get on at Harbour Front you can ride up to Faber mountain and then ride down through the skyscaper.
There are cheaper ways to get to the island!"
,,Great Views from the gondola.,4.0,,"The route covers a distance of 1.65km from Mount Faber to Sentosa Island passing though a high rise building at Harbour Front Station, and takes 15 minutes. The cost is S$29.90 for the return trip but pay S$35.00 and the fee includes the Sentosa Line. Pricey, but not something that you do everyday and you do get some great views. We were lucky to have a gondola to ourselves for each leg so managed to get some great photos without having to worry about other passengers. Staff are very helpful and the rides were an enjoyable experience."
,,Average experience,3.0,,"It is 14 minutes ride from Mount Faber Peak to Sentosa, A good view of the entire city and sentosa can be seen from here"
,,views make the difference,3.0,,The cable car is similar to other cable car rides but the view from the car will make people say wow. The cost is higher for this 3 minutes ride. kids might enjoy.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"I have always been petrified of these things, however as well we were staying on Sentosa, it was a great way to get around. My husband twisted my arm to go on this and after a few minutes I felt at ease.
The experience was great, from the staff, the ease of getting around and the view, this really is a great experience."
,,Good value day out,5.0,,This was a good value day out with plenty of places to see. We visited Sentosa and went to the beach and we walked the Henderson wave bridge. Definitely worth a full day.
,,Not sure if it is worth it,3.0,,"We have been to Sentosa before and this time we wanted to try the cable car and to be really honest I just can’t justify if it were worth the cost. Especially considering there is no air conditioning

Our ticket cost us $55 each which gave us unlimited cable cart rides and choice of 2 activities. We were heading to Sentosa for the segways so that ticket type worked for us

But it would have been much cooler, cheaper and easier to have just got a taxi and paid separately for the segway

I am just not sure if the view was worth it"
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Too many ways to travel to the sentosa island and we decided to take cable car, more expensive than other, but...worth it!...Amazing views from up there accross the sea to Sentosa island. Although rainy and cloudy but we can enjoy the trip.. Start Harbour Frount St -Mount Faber St - Sentosa St. and we change cable car Imbiah Look St heading to Siloso Beach . We recomended you to buy ticket via online than on the spot.."
,,Incredible Experience,4.0,,"Cable car to the Sentosa was one of the unforgettable experience of my life, it was fun to trade and its being my first time on cable car it was really mesmerised me and the view from the cable car was superb and breathtaking at some points. everyone should experience at least once in a life... must try."
,,Cable car singapore,4.0,,"Visited on 18/10/18 we are a mature couple with Grown up children so visited on our own at this quiet time of year experience was very good no queues to get on cable cars or any other transport
Ticket cost 35 sing dollars per adult no discount for seniors this included the car up to the top we then got another car to go round the island and back
From there we took the sky train to sentosa beach and a little trolly bus along the beach front (both free once you have your tickets)stopping for drinks at one of the beaches which again were deserted
We traveled from the orchard rd MRT via dhoby ghaut to harbour front where we purchased our tickets (MRT is very easy to use especially with everyone being so helpful)
NB PURCHASE YOUR TICKETS ON LINE IF YOU CAN AS IT SAVES YOU MONEY COST 24.50 sing dollars per adult saving more than 10 dol per adult"
,,Good fun,5.0,,We decided to take the cable car across to Sentosa Island. I can't remember how much it cost but do remember thinking it was good fun so I will go this way next time. It's fun to see the island from up high as you approach and it gives you a good idea how much there is there. Both there and back we had the cable car to ourselves even though it was busy on the way back. Recommend if you want to spend the extra money. This is the most expensive way across.
,,A must for tourist!,5.0,,"Went here with my Mrs and 1 year old baby! In fact i took this cable for 5 times in my lifespan. Great aerial view, personal fav when coming in to Sentosa, get to see the whole of Resort World and its stunning.

You’ll get a discount if you’re citizen.
The only downside is that it can be very stuffy in there and the hot weather definitely wont help but worth a ride though!"
,,Deserve some time to be spend !,4.0,,If you want to have a beautiful view of the city of Singapore you must go to take this cable car which facilitates also the access for Sentosa island and Mount Faber . If you chose to go there take the ticket which will allowed to visit also Aquarium . Deserve every cent ! Have fun !
,,Must do trip when on Sentosa Island,5.0,,"Buy tickets before travelling as this saves not only money but time queuing at the kiosks.
We took the cable car from Sentosa across to Faber Peak, had lunch at the hilltop restaurant before taking the cable back to the island.
The views crossing the high part harbour section are amazing.
Even on a Sunday there were no great crowds, so we had a cable car to ourselves on both trips."
,,"Slow but fun way to get into sentosa, great for kids",5.0,,"If you are expecting to ride on the cable car at least 2 times within a year, join the annual membership, it's cheaper than 1 round trip ticket. I joined as member because my kids love the ride, enjoyed the view even after riding so many times. Try to avoid HOT SUNNY day, the cable car can be a bit stuffy. AND avoid thundery lightning day, they close the service for safety concern. Best time to ride is evening and if you can get the timing right, hop on around 8pm, you get to see fireworks from the nearby universal studio entrance.
There are 2 cable car system, so if you are annual member, you ride both for free, and the car entrance to sentosa is free too. Try both cable car, the one within the island is shorter and only 3 stations, only if you are going to the beach will this make it worth the trip. If you go during day time, you see people playing the zip line across below the cable car screaming...
If there is no crowd, the staff are nice enough to allow you or your group into one cable car by themselves, no need to share and your kids can scream all they want.
Lastly, have a great dining experience on top of mount faber, the other side of the cable car station, the western food is delicious, service is great and the view is wonderful, cool and romantic.Nice toilet by the way, see thru glass to the cable car outside while washing your hands."
,,Top of sentosa,5.0,,This cable car is a great ride for children and adults alike. The view is brilliant and the service too is impeccable.
,,A must in Singapore ...,5.0,,"Get to the highest point on the island and take the glass bottom cars through a one stop in one of the high rise buildings near the harbor and on to Sentosa island. Great for all ages.
Take a taxi to the top, go one way on the cable cars, and spend the day on Sentosa."
,,Great Rides!,4.0,,"Enjoyed the rides with views from the sky! Sentosa great place to hang out. There are many things to see and do below ground as well. If you visit Singapore, a must do. The best thing about it was the small crowd made access easy and fun."
,,Family holiday,5.0,,"The cable car ride was a highlight of our trip. We purchased a Sentosa and Mount Faber ticket which meant we could do both attractions. We got on at Harbourfront station and went to Mount Faber where you can get off and look around, however we we chose to stay on and travel back through Harbourfront, where the line travels through the building and over the Harbour. We had fantastic views from the cabin. At Sentosa you transfer to another line with three stations. There are activities at each station. The ticket we purchased meant we could only get on and off at each station once and we finished where we started,. Tickets were S35 adult and S$25 which I think is great value given you can have a full days entertainment. There is plenty to do on Sentosa."
,,Exciting Experience!,5.0,,"I used to come and ride this cable car with my family. One of my 5-year-old daughter's favorite destinations in Singapore. You will see amazing view from the window. It is always exciting, but relaxing as well. There are many spots you will find from the window, but we especially like the moment we go over the highway!"
,,Best way to Sintosa Island,3.0,,"We purchased a ticket which included lunch at the Spud & Apron and the cable car itself. Whilst the cable car got us to the island the other half on the island was closed.

Spud & Apron food choice was very poor and not worth getting the deal."
,,Fabulous view .... smooth ride,5.0,,"Fabulous views from the cable car, a little expensive but glad we did it. Can be a bit nerve racking if you don’t like heights. Views of Sentosa and the harbour. Definately recommend using the cable car to visit Sentosa island. Only issue we had when leaving Sentosa the exit has you on a train that can confuse which cable car to exit the park to be where you started from."
,,Fun way to travel,5.0,,It was a nice & different way to get to Sentosa. Great view & a smooth ride. Only ran until 9.30pm which seems a little early when you are having so much fun on the many attractions Sentosa offers.
,,What an experience,5.0,,"We tossed around the idea of going to Sentosa island on the cable cars as we had been to Sentosa Universal Studios & the Aquarium before but had never used the cable cars.
Lucky we did because it was a bit scary at first but fantastic experience to get a 360 degree view of parts of Singapore, the harbour & Sentosa.
For the $35 you not only get a ride to the island & back but you also get a ride on the cable car on Sentosa. This too is a great experience as you ride high above the lush green canopy & view parts of the island & outer harbour.
Have lunch & a stroll around the island & get back on the cable car to take you home.
Can't recommend it more. Unless you have a mortal fear of heights give it a go. You won't regret it."
,,"SINGAPORE CABLE CAR, SINGAPORE",3.0,,"It used to pull in the crowds in the earlier years, BUT as time goes by it is now NOT in the MINDS of most tourists and locals. This could be due to the reason that there are so many easy and cheaper ways to go to SENTOSA, Nothing fantastic over the short ride from Faber Hill to the island and visa versa. Too many cable rides around the world and in asia, offering much more exciting rides at better prices! The management is trying HARD to gain clients offering dinning in the cab...etc, amongst other things. GOOD LUCK to them !!!"
,,Fabulous views over Sentosa and Singapore,5.0,,"We did the MRT from Marina Bay area to get the Cable Car over to Sentosa Islan, which was easy. Thoroughly enjoyed the ride over. The views were terrific. Sentosa is great for families and thrill seekers. Lots to do, We picked up an open bus ride around the beach areas which was really good. Give yourself plenty of time as there's a lot to see."
,,Kids love it!,5.0,,We have the season pass and for $39 (I think?) per person it is very worth it as my kids enjoy the view of the harbor and going to Sentosa. It is a bit of a scenic mode of transport but definitely not one for those who are afraid of heights. both the night and morning views are different but my preference is for the night view as you can see the lights of sentosa...
,,Nice Ride with Nice View points,5.0,,Nice Ride with Nice View points. One way to reach Santhosa. With a view of horbor and city. Must visit
,,Great fun!,4.0,,Purchased a two attraction and unlimited cable car ride ticket for 2 adults and 2 children. Cost $200 Singaporean dollars at the desk. It was good value as individually we would have paid more. Went up the Merlion and also the 50 storey lookout. Kids loved it. Easy access and great to use the cable car network.
,,"Excellent views, but short and expensive",4.0,,"It seems to be often under maintenance, so I would not recommend pre-booking tickets. The ride itself is very short both ways, Mt. Faber or Sentosa. Good for taking photos daytime, though.

Alternatively, you can just take a cab or hike on top of Mt. Faber via Southern Ridges (free) or take the monorail to Sentosa (S$4)."
,,walk in the sky,5.0,,"nice trip, walking on the clouds, a helicopter view over the city, excellent time to take pictures. is a mandatory go."
,,My Faber and Sentosa Cable Car Routes,5.0,,"We bought the round trip on the cable cars. It was a good deal to buy both rote’s and even better price wise to buy through the Klook site. We started at Harbourfront and went up to Mount Faber where we alighted. We walked to the Henderson Bridge and onto the forest walk. Then returned to Mount Faber to continue our journey to Sentosa. It was the middle of the day and rather hot in the cars. The Mt Faber cable cats have fans, but the Sentosa cable cars didn’t, so don’t forget a fan to cool yourself. The views were magnificent!"
,,Spectacular View,5.0,,We went in by chance to take the cable at night. The rides l with the beautiful night scenery of the harbor front and the Sentosa island.
,,A Must Do,5.0,,This is definitely a must do in Singapore. Great way to get to Santosa Island with plenty to do there!
,,Amazing cable car experience,4.0,,"This is one activity one should not miss while in Singapore. Great views, friendly staff, nice souvenir shop. Too bad the Sentosa line was closed for maintenance otherwise I would have rated it as 5/5."
,,Above The Clouds,5.0,,Caught the Singapore Cable Car a breathtaking 40 minute ride across the sky stunning panoramic views of the City and the Ocean and took some amazing photos brilliant
,,Good view,4.0,,This was a fun way to see another view of Singapore. The cable car is not a particularly long ride but it was fun and a good way to get to Sentosa island. Worth a ride
,,Disappointing,2.0,,"Taking the cableway to the hill is disappointing: the hill is not vey high, the view is exceptionally limited, there is no viewing platform (what view there is is largely taken by restaurants), and the cableway is relatively expensive. There are significantly higher and better views from Marina Sands deck and the Singapore Eye."
,,Amazing views,5.0,,"Located near Sentosa, this attraction provides several options for clients to see different views of the city. Prices are reasonable & the views are amazing. Highly recommended."
,,Feel like a Bird in here,5.0,,"Cable car is a unique experience and must try in Singapore as you do not get such experience everywhere often. This gives you a very good view of the city. The waiting time is less and you can easily get a whole cabin for yourself even when you are alone. Although I felt a bit hot, because there is no aircon. Rest assured, please go ahead and have a wonderful experience here."
,,Not a bad view,3.0,,The Sentosa line didn't work on the day we visited. Bit annoyed that we were still sold a ticket that included the full price for both lines.
,,Excellent views of Singapore & Sentosa Island especially at dusk,4.0,,"No need to pre-purchase tickets as the ride is fairly popular but cable cars are continually available. Took the cable car rides from Sentosa and return rather than to Sentosa (we went to Sentosa on the MRT ... great, cheap and convenient). Provides great views of mainland Singapore and towards Sentosa Island. Highly recommend doing the trip at dusk so you get the combination of late afternoon sun and lighting from the buildings, roads & attractions."
,,Over to Sentosa,3.0,,"Went over to Sentosa for the day which was lovely to see the sites. Disappointingly the cable car on the island was closed for scheduled maintenance.

We took the car up to the point and did the whole cable journey onto the island. We set off around 11am so lucky to have a cable car to ourselves."
,,A One Time Must Do,4.0,,"There are some things that you must experience once and thats that. The Cable Car is worth that one experience even if it is just a 10 minute ride with a waiting time of 10-15 minutes or worse if there are large tour groups at the same time as you. The best way to do it is to take a one way ride from Mount Faber Station to Sentosa Station or beyond. That ensure that you fly over the harbour and enter into Sentosa which is the most scenic part of the ride. It also means that you cross at least one stop and get sufficient time on the ride.
The cable car moves at a fairly slow and even pace. Those afraid of heights might feel uncomfortable especially while looking down. But my 3 year old son could handle it so it shouldn't pose too much of a risk to anyone. A one way ride is enough - you do want to see the harbour sights and also the Sentosa attraction from above. A return ride may not be very enjoyable as you would be moving upwards instead of downwards."
,,Worth a ride,5.0,,"If you only have a day or two in the city, this is well worth a ride. Well organised. Various options available to combine attractions. Amazing views."
,,CAR ON AIR,4.0,,"Riding on singapore Cable car is a wonderful experience. It gives a birds eye view of Universal Studio, the port, Sentosa Island and lot more"
,,Fun but pricey,4.0,,"We took the cable car as part of trip to Universal studios. Unfortunately, we did not buy the photo that was taken of us at the time by the company and when I tried to buy it via email a few days later I was advised that photos are only retained for 24 hours. My fault, but very disappointing.

The cable car itself is fun and offers great views across Singapore and into Sentosa Island. It is quite expensive for what it is which was the reason I did not want to buy the also expensive photo earlier just in case I ran out of money!

My suggestion is that if you can afford it, then definitely take the cable car as it is a great experience so would recommend it."
,,Great Views,5.0,,"Wasn't sure about doing this as not to good with heights but pleased we did, great way to finish leaving Sentosa island. But we had a problem trying to get Taxi at the end as it seemed to be Peak hour, weren't sure how to get back had to ask at the mall for them to ring us Taxi, they were not keen but did in the end thankfully."
,,"Amazing experience, bird eye view of Sentosa",5.0,,Absolutely safe and enjoyable ride from and to Sentosa. The complete ride is a little expensive but worth the money if you enjoy being suspended high above water. You can enjoy the ride with cool breeze and get a bird's eye view before reaching Sentosa.
,,Amazing Views,5.0,,"Worth a ride, just for the view. Amazing views of the harbour and Sentosa Island. Easy access to Sentosa, or just ride the car for fun."
,,Enjoyable short trip with good Harbour views,3.0,,"Fun way to see Sentosa island and also travel on the island to its tip, as well as visiting Mt Faber in the other direction. Got the round trip ticket that covered a trip to each station and cost $32. Lots of ticket options with some including theme park tickets. Queue was small and never had to wait long to get on a gondola but as the day wears on it got busier so look to start early. Mine had air con and you could take pictures out of a small window of the various views. You are in an industrial harbour area so the sites are not that special but good nonetheless. Sentosa island is such a fun place it is a must to use this mode of transportation in my opinion."
,,Dinner with a view,5.0,,"Spent the evening Dining in the cable car, what an awesome experience, service was excellent food fantastic and a lovely experience"
,,Amazing Views,5.0,,What a ride. Amazing views of Singapore and Santosa Island as you go. Definitely a must do when in Singapore.
,,Cable car,5.0,,One time do activity Nice view Try to get both lines Sentossa and mountfaber line. Try to by online tickets try hideout.com
,,amazing transportation,5.0,,"if you want to feel the another of sensation to go at Sentosa island ... you can try to ride the cable car ... by paying 35 SGD you can back and forth , and go around Sentosa island. Strat from Haobourfront tower 2 cable car station - sentosa island - harbourfront - mount faber and go back to harbourfront.."
,,One time enjoyment,5.0,,This is must take for ontime enjoyment to sentosa island with your family and friends it cost around 20 to 30 SSD
,,nice views,4.0,,one of the ways to travel to the sentosa island...quite amazing views from up there...there is a Queue though..it travels at a leisurely pace...
,,GREAT VIEW,5.0,,"This is a must do activity. Take the cable car line to Mount faber and back to senthosa. The views are mesmerizing and the height is great too... You can come to the harbourfront station via MRT and the cable car line is the adjoining building. Recommend everyone to buy tickets online to avoid ques. I bought tickets too Klook website.
Enjoy"
,,magical!!,5.0,,"it is very enjoyable ride. there are 2 lines; therefore make sure you buy tickets for the 2 lines. you will see different aspects of Singapore and Sentosa. Definitely highly recommended. however, it can get a bit hot inside the cable car during hot Singapore days."
,,Do not miss it - great value,5.0,,"Great value as your ticket can cover both lines (to and from Sentosa, and also internal line). Unbeatable views of the city, universal studios and adventure parks. Appear safe and sturdy which is a must when travelling with anyone afraid of heights. Lines weren’t long and rarely have to share a car."
,,GREAT VIEWS,4.0,,"Excellent views of port, city and Sentosa Island. For an extra $2 you got to ride the cable car on the island too."
,,Don't be put of the price.,5.0,,The cable car can be taken from either Harbour Front or Mount Faber. It used to be a way to get to Sentosa after which the internal mode of transport would be used. Now the cable car is also used as a mode of transport internally to get around the island so the price of $35 + includes this.
,,Santosa Island,5.0,,"We caught the Cable Car to Sentosa Island.Might be an idea to pre-purchase tickets as the line was long and took some time to purchase tickets.The trip itself was fabulous. Sentosa Island is not really my thing, just a giant holiday resort but still worth it if only for the cable car."
,,Great views and a great way to get around Sentosa,4.0,,"Highly efficnient and a very comfortable ride. We rode the whole cablecar network, up to Faber Peak, then down to Sentosa Island, then switched cable lines to the Merlion and to Fort Silosa. Fantastic views whever you look."
,,Beautiful Views,4.0,,This is a great way to see some of Singapore from above. You can go through Santosa Island and you can go from Santosa Island to Singapore.
,,Safe,5.0,,"Very good to do, I was a little scared at first with the height but was very confident on the way back I would highly recommend this for everyone."
,,Great veiws,5.0,,"What a great way to get to the most beautiful island in Singapore. For a few dollars more you get to travel above the island ,North ,South ,East and West. Great way to travel if you find it too hot/ far to walk."
,,Amazing Experience,5.0,,"One of the best experience - one ticket for multiple rounds and awesome view. Must visit for all, amazing experience - it is for all the group age group."
,,Great View,4.0,,Went on the cable car after a day in universal studios. Great views and a lovely way to relax and take in the views we only wanted to go across the bay but had to buy a return trip . Good job too as the are no taxis or even the Grab a taxi in sight nice restaurants at the viewing point though
,,stunning experience of moving at such a high elevation,5.0,,hopping in at harbour front and moving up towards faber peak and again gliding back to sentosa overseeing the complete singapore resort skyline is a phenominal experience.
,,Really love the cable car,5.0,,"This makes for some great views, and is my favorite way to get over to Sentosa. Not the fastest way, but my favorite."
,,Great view,3.0,,"Look to be honest i wouldn't bother doing this again. Its pricey and a short trip to Sentosa. Make sure you get your tickets at the bottom before you go up otherwise you have to go back down again, despite having bought tickets online. So if you have bought tickets online beforehand, please line up downstairs first."
,,Nice experience,5.0,,Cable car rides were very good. We enjoyed the rides. Well maintained. The one between Silosa beach and Merlion was not airconditioned.
,,No complains,5.0,,"Very good experience ! good views, comfortable & we felt secure. good fun with family. We all loved it."
,,Must do,5.0,,Wonderful panoramic views of entire Sentosa. Dont forget to try to seeing the merlion sitting from the cable car
,,Great views of Sentosa Island from the cable car,5.0,,Enjoyable ride on the cable car. Greats view of Sentosa Isand waterfront. Too short ride though. Cable cars are clean and safe.
,,Ok....,4.0,,"It's a novelty.... if you're not too sure whether you should do it maybe don't, but if you do, you'll have an OK time."
,,Started from harbour front,5.0,,Bought the promotion deal. Inclusive of sentosa internal cable car ride. Beautiful aerial view. Started from harbour front to sentosa. When down in sentosa n got on the internal cable car ride. Played sky luge then head back to main cable car line head to mount Faber then back to sentosa then finally to harbour front. Parked the car on the 7th storey nearby next building.
,,GREAT TRIP!,5.0,,"Bought the tickets online while in Singapore, got a great discount! Picked tickets up at Tower 2 which is posted from the MRT. Took the Faber line up to Faber peak which was quite quick, views are ok nothing to write home about. After a quick pit stop we took the line over to Sentosa which offers great views ❤️ once on the Island you can pick up Siloso line cable car which has good views over the island. Good value for money if booked online would highly recommend. ❤️"
,,Great views,5.0,,"Amazing views, just make sure you are ok with cable cars! I was not aware how high they go. But if you hold on tight the view is worth it. Make sure to go all the way to the top and tie on the bell!"
,,Unique cable car trip,4.0,,"From Mount Faber, the cable car runs to Sentosa Island and is the most fun way of reaching there. You can see the Marina the ships, the docks, the entire port, the fun area of the Sentosa Park. Its totally worth the trip, if you are deciding to go or not."
,,Nice Views. Shop around for tickets.,4.0,,"If you haven't done a cabe car before, this is well worth the experience. We were staying on Sentosa, so thought this was a good option for getting off the island, and having a look around the city. We bought our tickets online, only an hour before we boarded, and got round-trip tickets (2 adults, and a child), for S$62. That was round-trip for both lines.

There are two lines, the Faber line takes you from Sentosa over to Mt Faber and back. The other line focuses on Sentosa itself, with some sightseeing across the island. Other reviewers will tell you that if you require to get back to Singapore CBD by taxi, it's best to alight at Harbourfront Station. That was our plan - we originally planned to go to Mt Faber, have a look around, and then go back to Harbourfront to get a taxi, however a bus load of tourists arrived at the wrong time, and the lines to get back on at Faber were huge, so we called a taxi (Grab taxi), and they picked us up from Mt Faber in a couple of minutes, and was only S$11 to get into Lau Pa Sat market.

There isn't any audio in the cable cars to tell you exactly what you are looking towards, so we just made up our own stories. The cable car seats 6-8 people, and is safe, and doesn't sway like other cable cars I've been on.

The experience is open from 8:45 AM to 10 PM. The last boarding will be at 9:30 PM"
,,Easy and Fun!,5.0,,"So glad that we took cable car went into Sentosa, then take taxi back, gave us the air view and also chance drive around the manmade island."
,,Nice tour,4.0,,A20 minutes ride over the Marin. Start in the forest. Very nice view of Santa’s and the hills. Recommended.
,,Don't tckets buy before you get to Singapore!,1.0,,The cable car trip to Sentosa Island and back was fine a great way to see the sites. We (two of us) however pre-purchased a double ticket which included the Mt Faber and Sentosa Line as a package. When we arrived on the island the Sentosa Line was not working and staff could not tell us when it would be up and running. When we had to leave it was still out of action and staff would not refund any money Would have been cheaper to buy it on the day as we would have only had to pay for one line
,,Wow!,4.0,,Got our ticket included in the Singapore Stopover package. Views are amazing and it is a good way to rest your legs while looking at the scenery.
,,Varied spectacular views,5.0,,Views and experience to keep young and old engaged. The views during daylight as well as night time ie dark hours are varied and worth it. Highly recommend to take a to and fro pass to santosa Island.
,,Spectacular views,5.0,,"Spectacular view of Singapore. Best way to get to santosa. A must do in Singapore. Tickets are a bit pricey, especially if you are traveling with large family"
,,The walks at the top of Mt Faber are beautiful,4.0,,"The cable car isn't that special, but the views at the top of Mt Faber are. The price drops after 6pm for those watching their budget, though personally I think going up via cable car at 5pm would be perfect. When you get to the top, get out of the tourist complex and head towards Henderson Waves Bridge, and then spend a couple of hours wandering through the tracks and pedestrian walkways at the top and watch the sunlight fade and Singapore's lights come on, while meandering through both National Park tracks and formal gardens, Do the former before the light fades; these don't have street lamps and are more interesting when you can still see the birds and other wildlife. We didn't see any monkeys but could hear them."
,,Must go.,5.0,,The mount faber trek and the singapore car are very nice and you should go. It is not a very short cable car trip and it is quite scenic.
,,The views aren’t worth the hype,3.0,,"There are two lines to do, the faber line to take you from the harbour front and back the other Sentosa line a little sightseeing across the island.

The price seems steep if you just want to get to the island and the shuttle is probably better.

Whilst high up the views are underwhelming, so much building work is being done along with passing next to a major import shipping hub just allows you to see endless rows of shipping containers and some men pouring concrete.

There is nothing in the cars or before to tell you what you are looking towards and indeed one end of the line seems to have nothing to get off and see.

For me a waste of time and money"
,,Brilliant,5.0,,We pre purchased the tickets as they are cheaper than at the booth. Great experience - can see loads - getting off at the stops gives a better experience as you can see what is around each area
,,Go at night,4.0,,Went up here at night where adults pay a child’s price ($22 round trip). Good view of the bay and city skyline as well as the various coloured lights.
,,HIghlight of our Trip,5.0,,"You can access the Mount Faber Cable cars starting point and the ticket office by taxi which is the best mode of transportation. You can purchase round trip cable ride to Mount Faber or to Sentosa Island. The latter option is definitely worth it. You will be able to visit the aquarium, Universal Studio, restaurants and shops in Sentosa Island. You can relax in the path enjoy what the island has to offer. The cable car will hold up to six people and goes over the Singapore skyline and you can see the Cruise ships, barges and supply ship from the cable cars through the panoramic windows. If you just purchased the mount Faber pass then you will have to get off the first stop and visit a few attractions there. However, paying the extra to visit Sentosa Island is well worth your trip. You can have the reception desk call the taxi for you once you arrive back to the staging area. Remember your price includes round trip ticket and you can stay in Santos Island as long as you desire. The closing time is 10:00 pm"
,,Good attraction,4.0,,Buy return pass to visit all stations twice. Easy to navigate around sentosa island if you have the pass.
,,Fabulous Views,5.0,,Great fun & fabulous view from the cable car. Very good view of the city below & Sentosa Island. The Merlion looks spectacular as you approach.
,,The only way to get to Sentosa,5.0,,"Despite the price, it is well worth taking the Cable Car to Sentosa Island. Starting from Mount Faber station, it is a comfortable and photogenic way to see Sentosa from above.

Crossing over the Harbour and overlooking Adventure Waterpark, you start to get excited about the day ahead.

Our main aim for the day was Universal/Adventure Waterpark, however on the way home, we stayed on the Cable Car to view the Megazip Adventure Park.

The Cable Car comfortably seats 6-8 people and is very safe and doesn't sway like other cable cars around the world.

As mentioned by other reviewers, if you require to get back to Singapore CBD by taxi, best to alight at Harbourfront Station."
,,So much to see,5.0,,"We got On the cable car at harbour front and set of for mount faber.
We walked to the top and a lot of history was available about Singapore through the ages.
After looking at the view, we headed to Henderson Wave!
Omg, amazing piece of structure.
We walked the whole length before heading back to the cable car to go on to Sentosa island.
The cable car on to the island is pretty high and great views.
Coming back at night, it was pretty special (in my opinion)"
,,Very disappointing,2.0,,This is Very disappointing it takes you to a look out and theres nothing much to see or do except restaurant VERY BORING It also takes to to Santosa
,,Pricey but excellent experience,4.0,,"Its a good experience for children who have never got the chance to ride a cable car before. The view was fantastic and the ride was comfortable. Getting on and off was easy even for a 6 yo.

Recommended if you have the budget to arrive to the island memorably considering other alternative of transport to the island is much cheaper."
,,Yupeeee,5.0,,I always have a dream to go in cable car..I have taken 1 way cable car to sentosa island..it was amazing experience n liked the cable car..In one car 2 pax can travel
,,A great way to arrive to Santosa island,5.0,,"We bought a return ticket from Mount Faber. Tip: on the way back it's better to get out at the Harbour stop - a lot easier to get a taxi. The views are spectacular, different at night and during the day."
,,Very scenic and relaxing cable car experience,5.0,,Our family went to Vivocity and bought the $68 family day pass that included unlimited cable car and two activities/rides at Sentosa. We all enjoyed the nice views the whole way. Highly recommended and will come back again.
,,spectacular,5.0,,"Very nice experience that really worth to try it. It is necessary to improve the transfer to and from the start, which is done only by taxi!"
,,Wow what a view,5.0,,"We arrived in the early morning for a brilliant view of Singapore, and Sentosa. Please experience the majestic views for yourself, you wont be disappointed :)"
,,GENTLE WAY TO LAND IN SENTOSA,5.0,,"One of the many ways to access Sentosa Islands. The ride is good, though we entered the wrong building to access the boarding point. The two day pass includes a ride by the cable car so do not purchase it separately. May not be suitable for people who are afraid of heights"
,,Great view - Was a bit rocky,4.0,,"Great way to see Singapore, but it appears that even on fairly windless days, the cars can be a bit rocky. I had to sit in the middle so I wasn't causing the car to rock too much. Glad I did it though"
,,Nice scenic way of getting to Sentosa Island,4.0,,"Me and my family took the cable car from the main point and took the cable car to Sentosa Island, one of the stops this car goes through. It was smooth and quiet, no complaints from me."
,,Sentosa and Mt Faber,5.0,,"Well the cable car trip is amazing with great views in all directions. Gives an awesome perspective on the layout on Sentosa as you pass over the island.
On return we went up to Mt Faber enjoying the scenery and views. The walk down if you choose is pretty awesome also."
,,A good way to get to Sentosa Island,4.0,,"The views were not as 'amazing' as I expected, but it was still worth it. The evening dining option looked interesting...."
,,A nice relaxing ride!,4.0,,"I went on this cable car with my wife on our honeymoon in April 2017 right after spending a day at Paramount theme park. It was a welcome chill out after all that waking around & going on rides.
You get to see beach resorts & lots of other places from above & it cuts down on your transport fare back to your hotel if your hotel isn't near by."
,,fast and exciting,5.0,,A great way to get to Sentosa An exciting trip across the water at a reasonable price with clean cars and friendly staff.
,,Very smooth,4.0,,Took my elderly Mum on this cable car and we both enjoyed the experience. The boarding was easy and it didn’t take too long on the lineup.
,,Up sky view,5.0,,"This journey is very nice, relaxing and amazing view up sky. You will see a lot of view amd stress free. There is also stopover area, you can look around, selfies and food court for eating"
,,Cable Cars,5.0,,"Worth having a ride on them both to Sentosa, and in Sentosa. They are very high, as they cross from Singapore to Sentosa, so the view is specacular."
,,A great way to see Singapore.,4.0,,"A fun thing to do although not overly cheap but that's to be expected in tourist towns.
Weekends are very busy but weekdays are not so bad and we had a car to ourselves.
Beware! Trying to get a cab back from there in nigh on impossible. Be prepared to ring for one at the taxi stand."
,,Reaching Sentosa,5.0,,Definitely the best way to visit Sentosa. Great views of the main island as well as the little Sentosa island from above. It is highly recommended though a bit too expensive for the short distance ride. That's the only reason I gave it very good rather than excellent.
,,Awesome way to travel to Sentosa Island,5.0,,"As well as great views of Singapore this is the best way to travel to Sentosa Island to visit Universal Studios, Singapore Luge & all the fantastic activities on Sentosa"
,,Another ride.,3.0,,The $35 list price is excessive if you just want to get to Sentosa Island and their are plenty of cheaper ways to do so. It's better to see this as a ride where you get to see the city from a different point of view. Pick up a discounted ticket on Klook to take a bit of the sting out of the pricing and you're good to go.
,,We did it twice!!,5.0,,"We took the bus to Sentosa but when we got there we took the cable car back to Singapore and then back to Sentosa! We had a car to ourselves, which was great. We then took the cable car at Sentosa and did the trip around there. Worth a go!"
,,Nice trip,5.0,,If you fancy some relaxation while in Singapore use the cable car to visit Sentosa Island. Loads to do there or just go to the lovely beach
,,Funtastic View,5.0,,One of must try attraction at Singapore with stunning view. U can use Cable Car from Singapore to Sentosa Island and at Sentosa Island too.
,,Stunning views,4.0,,"Nice experience it was while travelling in this to go to Sentosa island. Ofcourse, the stunning views are something to cherish"
,,A birds-eye view.,4.0,,"We did the entire round trip from Faber peak to Sentosa and back, but got off at the Harbour front tower as we were told its' easier to get taxis back to the city from there. Except long queues though, but the shopping is great at the mall at the ground level."
,,Great views during the day,4.0,,"The view from the cable car was beautiful. When we went, the queues were not too long so the four of us were able to get in a car without anyone else. The round trip is really nice as you can get off whenever you'd like to, to look around and get back on."
,,Nice scenic ride,3.0,,"We started from Mt. Faber to Sentosa in the morning. There is a package offered that includes some of the attractions offered in Sentosa. However, the information provided is not always up to date.

The view was really nice on the ride. We did the return trip to Harborfront, which was also nice."
,,Twilight ride was Awesome,5.0,,We took the ride to Fabre peak just on dusk.the sunset and then the city’s lights were beautiful. We also took the other gondola as well another day.
,,The views from up here are magical during the day or night.,5.0,,We loved our trip on the Singapore Cable Car. You can stop at multiple locations including Sentosa. The views are stunning on a clear day. I highly recommend this experience when visiting Singapore.
,,Definitely worth a try,4.0,,"Sentosa Cable car is a good way to travel in and out of Sentosa. It costs you $33 , however at the entrance you can avail combo offers with SEA or Universal Studio.
Combo offers give you unlimited rides. The substitute to the Cable car is the Sentosa express which costs only $4 however you can also try that for free once your inside Sentosa. I would recommend spending extra for the unlimited cable car ride as you can go from on spot to another in no time."
,,very high,4.0,,it was a bit scary as it is really high worth a trip up to Mount Faber and then to the end of Sentosa
,,The best means of transportation to Sentosa Islands.,5.0,,"CYC+CG ( 18.07.19 )
This cable car was from Faber Mount to Sentosa Islands. I think this cable car was the best means to Sentosa Islands. The view of Singapore was good during cable car. The price was a little higher than I think, but the way to Sentosa was the best by Cable car."
,,How to get High!,5.0,,What an amazing experience it was to take the Cable Car from Faber Park to Sentosa Island. The smooth ride over the landscape of rainforest and water was exciting and breathtaking! High up in the air gave an excellent overview of the Fun Island with all the facilities in view. You could literally see for miles!
,,Singapore Cable Car,5.0,,You can have complete view of the city while taking the tour of Cable car from Faber Park to Sentosa.
,,Morning Visit,5.0,,"Went on trip to Sentosa including a visit to the aquarium was well worthwhile, over 50 sharks to be seen!!"
,,Cable Cars certainly worth it,5.0,,"Fantastic Views and a great way to get onto Sentosa. Day was overcast and a bit stormy when we went, but it was still awesome"
,,"Beautiful views, lots to do",5.0,,"We bought the unlimited ride package and spent at least 5 hours travelling around by cable car and viewing the various sites at each of the stops. We started fairly early (around 10 am) and had each cable car to ourselves up until our last ride in the afternoon when it started to get busy.

Definitely recommended to spend a few hours here."
,,Leave a day to visit Sentosa Island,4.0,,"You can take the Cable Car or train to Sentosa Island. I started by taking the cable car to the Island, then traveled on the Cable car over the island, stopping as I made my way round. Then on the way home took the cable car back.

Good idea if visiting Universal Studios"
,,It's all about the view,4.0,,Cable car was fantastic. The 360* view was just mind blowing. Especially on the Sentosa island trail and above the cruise. You surely wouldn't find similar views anywhere in Singapore except for the cable car. It was a good ride and a wonderful experience watching over the cityscape.
,,Best way to go to Sentosa,5.0,,Although you may go through Train and Taxi to Sentosa but the best way to reach is through Cable Car. Little heavy on pocket but worth the ride.
,,Trip to sentosa,4.0,,Cable car to sentosa. The ride allows us to have a paranomic view of the waterfront of western Singapore.
,,An enjoyable ride,4.0,,The cable car ride especially if you make use of one of the many discounts available on many sites makes for an enjoyable way to get a birds eye view of the mainland across to Sentosa Island. This ride coupled with the cable car on Sentosa is a fun activity. On the day we visited being a Sunday the ride was never heavily patronised meaning that there were no queues and more often than not as we boarded and alighted at the different stations the two of us had a car to ourselves.
,,Wonderful ride,5.0,,We rode two cable cars that intersected from Sentosa over to the mainland. We stopped for refreshments at Faber peak and then rode down to the bottom. Great views and a smooth ride all the way.
,,Very organised,5.0,,"We were very luck as a local used his card to give us 50% discount, so we paid $35 for two for both rides. So clean and staff helpful, bathrooms very good. Cafes have very good coffee. We went early and had no waiting to get on or off the cars. Great views.. the gardens are beautiful. No wait for taxi when we finished at Mount Faber"
,,Amazing views,5.0,,We always to the cable cars anywhere we happen to go. And these ones certainly didn't disappoint paid a couple of dollars more to do the park and the city well worth the extra
,,Very Good Experience with Cable car,5.0,,"Very Good Experience with Cable car,relay its time was amazing. we have ful enjoy and good feel with cable car"
,,Up Up and Away,5.0,,"We took this cable car from Mount Faber to the Harbour Front and then the second option on to Sentosa Island itself.
Mt Faber gives you some great views but the ride on the cable car really is tremendous - super views over Sentosa Island, the bottom part of the Malacca Straits, Singapore Harbour and then back over to the CBD.
Thrilling and it really does let you see so much then you can appreciate just how dynamic Singapore's growth and development has been.
Really worth it - but save you pennies; a bit expensive."
,,A High Climb!,5.0,,"Get off MRT at harbour front and walk through shopping centre to purchase tickets. The cable car takes you to two separate routes - one to Mount Fabre and the other to Sentosa. You can travel to both. It is very high and a great experience.

There is not much at Mount Faber a cafe and a walk but I went in June and it was really too hot to walk far.

A great way to get to Sentosa, there is also a boardwalk and monorail you can use to get to Sentosa.

As we had walked to Sentosa we went both routes but disembarked at Mount Faber. Can’t remember the cost but it is not expensive and a great experience."
,,Great way to view Singapore!,5.0,,"We had a great experience on the cable car. It was such a fun way to get to Sentosa. You'll be able to see the city from high above. If you ride it at night, you'll see the city light at night. It's beautiful. Best way to go if you plan to visit Sentosa."
,,A Different View of Singapore,4.0,,"Tickets: We bought a Universal Studio+Aquarium+Cable Car combination ticket online. Buying tickets online beforehand did not help skip the queue. We had to stand in the same line as everyone else (who are buying tickets) to redeem tickets/vouchers. In fact we felt that people buying tickets on the counter got better bargain/discounts and free gifts while we just got a paper version of our tickets redeemed.

Directions: While arriving from VivoCity we found directions to the starting point bit tricky. It also involved significant walking while we had to keep an eye on the signage.

Review: The cable cars are one of three transport options to get to the Sentosa island. The cable cars were clean and at all the stops the cars came quite frequently. We never had to wait more than 30 seconds for a ride. So it's safe, fast, efficient, the views are pleasant and unlike monorail it does not get crowded. The cable car also goes to Siloso point which otherwise can only be reached by taxi or on foot."
,,Had the worst experience in 6 days spent in Singapore,1.0,,"We pre-purchased Day Fun Pass Play 5 for Santosa, which included ""Cable Car"" as per T&C, and headed to the Ticketing counter at Tower 2 in Habourfront to catch the cable car to Santosa. The staff there advised that such type of tickets must be redeemed on Level 3 at Vivo City.

I went all the way to find the place as advised by the cable car staff, and came back with the formal passes redeemed.

Upon using the passes to get on the cable car, other staff told me that I had to go back down to Level 1 to exchange for the tickets for the trip, which I did.

Went all the way back to Level 1 from Level 10 in the 30 degree hot humid weather. And then surprisingly, the staff at the ticketing counter told me this time that the ""Cable Car"" included in the Fun Pass for Santosa can NOT be used for the cable car to Santosa. I questioned him why his staff didn't tell me when I first came to redeem my eTickets. The reply from him was I can make a complaint!!! That's it.

As a tourist with 2 small children from overseas, I didn't know that the Cable Car included in Santosa Fun Pass is not for Cable Car to Santosa. When I started explaining what's happened to other staff, my 7 years old son just told me in a different language ""Dad, they don't care what you have complained at all""."
,,great views,4.0,,"the views from the cable cars are great, you can see all the way around the islands, we toured on all of the cars & saw some amazing sights, it was a very hot day & the cars were still reasonable cool."
,,A world class experience,5.0,,"I will suggest every one to travel in Singapore Cable car, the kind of landscapes you see and the feeling you go through are the life time experiences.its really safe to be on this cable car."
,,Good experience,5.0,,"Great view over Sentosa and best way to get there, a must try even for the faintest of hearts and the most fearful of heights. The view from the cable car is all worth it!!"
,,Singapore from up High,4.0,,"Caught the Cable Car from the Harbour Front Station up to Mount Faber. Walked around for 30 minutes admiring the beauty of the forest area on the mountain. Then rode the Cable Car all the way down to Sentosa Island. The whole operation is well run with the cable cars themselves looking very new, and as with everything in Singapore, very clean. Being mostly glass everyone gets a clear view during the trip.
I highly recommend you take a ride!"
,,"Budget , convince and safe",5.0,,Its best thing to travel around Singapore its main stop will give you full access to main attractions of Singapore to visit.
,,Well maintained and fast,4.0,,Kids enjoy it and you get good view of Sentosa island from top. You can get great pictures during sunset time.
,,Outstanding,5.0,,Was everything we expected and more from the taxi driver to the people who worked there a great day out
,,Singapore from the air,5.0,,"MRT to Harbour point, the cable car to Sentosa Island all for 25$, enjoy the views of the beaches and Ships waiting to enter harbour.
Take the sky walk to Siloso Point to get an idea of the past and defence of Singapore.
We were only there for the morning, you could spend all day and still want to go back
A great day out for all ages"
,,The worst service mind on earth,1.0,,"I just don’t understand why such a high technology and developed country like Singapore can not train an employee that’s working at the cable car station at Mt. Faber.

We were forced to ride a cable car with other people as animals...!

We didn’t mind to ride with other people even on our honeymoon trip, which we love to have a private time.

But, all you had to do was “just ask nicely”

As we spend time in Sentosa for our honeymoon trip, the first impression was bad, we knew that the cable car seat arrangement Indian girl can speak many languages,
But the only language she can’t speak is “SERVICE MIND LANGUAGE”

As I mentioned before “we are not animals”
Don’t treat a person that bring you a money like this....!"
,,Best way to arrive at Sentosa Island,5.0,,Catch the cable car for an aerial view of Sentosa Island and arrive in style. See all the attractions from overhead. Return trip was not expensive and saved the hassle of trying to park your car.
,,Great journey to Sentosa,4.0,,"This is a great way to transit to Sentosa Island. Fantastic views across Singapore and Sentosa. Also an excellent way to return from Sentosa.

If you are flying Singapore Airlines and have access to a Singapore Explorer Pass this is included and is well worth the time."
,,A thrilling experience,5.0,,We went to Sentosa island by cable car. It gives thrilling views of the southern coastline and a bit of the city. A must for Singapore visitors.
,,Joy ride!,5.0,,"This is another way to reach Santosa Island from the main island. There are two cable car lines - One that goes from Mt. Faber to Santosa Island and another within Santosa Island. Both are fun and highly recommended!! View of Singapore is breathtaking and if its your lucky day, you can even get to see Cruise Ships from up above. It can get crowded but everything is very well organized and managed."
,,Go just for the Cable car,5.0,,"It was worth going just for the main cable car ride, we then added a few activities, zip line and Jade our lunch in one of the beach café. Went to the mountain stop seemed it was just geared to eating in the restaurants."
,,Very interesting trip - great views all around...,4.0,,My family and I enjoyed an amazing trip from Universal studios and back. We had nice views of Sentosa island and surroundings...It's a must when going in Singapore. Be careful with young children...
,,Ride to sentosa,4.0,,"My family and I caught the cable car to sentosa. My 8yo thought it was great! Although it is abit pricey, it is one of those must do tourist attractions while in Singapore"
,,Nice little trip,5.0,,"I love cable cars and this one was fun and such a great view of Sentosa, would love to go on again at night because the views would have been spectacular."
,,Amazing trip.,5.0,,"Up near the sun, life it`s wonderful and the view make you more than happy! Nice, clean cab, very good stuff. I advice to take such a trip to everyone."
,,Cable Car Ride,4.0,,It is fabulous while you ride through cable car it is over view of Santosa Island Universal studio and overview of whole singapore
,,Singapore Cable Cars,5.0,,"We started at the Harbour Front, then went up to Mount Faber where you can walk to the Henderson Wave which is an interesting bridge across a large gorge. There is always the Happiness Bell to ring near the restaurant. We then went across to Sentosa and then picked up the cable car that runs the length of Sentosa. Sentosa is a holiday resort and has loads to do. I braved the zip slide where the drive to the top of the hill was nearly as adrenalin draining as the zip slide itself. The slide is over in no time. A spoiler alert, when they weigh you as they fit the harnesses, they write the weight on your wrist band. It is the heavier customer that speeds down the sip slide"
,,Great Experiance,5.0,,Great way to see some magnificent scenery from Mount Faber to Santosa Island & view the ships going down the waterways. Some great views when passing over Santosa to the final stop.
,,Excellent view of city and waterfront,4.0,,"We used the monorail system to cross to Sentosa and decided to travel back by cable car. When purchasing ticket for return we were told that we had to purchase a full return ticket so by travelling by cable car over and back is the best option. The cable car gave us the opportunity of being able to have a great view of city and port but we found that we had to stop and change to another station to complete our journey, but it was entirely worth it."
,,Scared the heck out of me - very high if you like excitement,4.0,,"I boarded in the middle of the 2 directions it goes. It is super high up for amazing views of the seaport and the surrounding islands and straits. It is very safe now, but I am not so much one for dramatic heights. Even so you should do it just for the all encompassing views. When you get to one of the islands there is a another small network of more cable cars, and if you buy the combined ticket all these routes are included."
,,If you are thinking of doing....,5.0,,Just do it! Excellent from start to finish ..we timed it so it was light on way to Sentosa..and dark on the way back.Well worth the effort.
,,Another amazing view,4.0,,"Great value for money, an amazing view but you need to get there early otherwise you could be waiting an hour or more to get on"
,,Fun way to see Singapore and Sentosa,4.0,,Road the cable car from Sentosa to Mt. Faber. Great views of Sentosa and of Singapore and the harbor. Will go back again.
,,Lovely view,5.0,,"The cable car ride is smooth and super which takes you to Sentosa island. Timings 9am to 9pm
At first I was scared but slowly the fear went away. Staff is polite and helpful.
It's so well maintained and beautiful the surrounding that you forget everything else. Can go from Sentosa to mount faber and back.
Experience - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Maintenance - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
,,Breathtaking View,5.0,,This is the cable car that takes you directly to Sentosa.... offers unparalleled birds eye view to the waterfront and the underlying resorts as if you are flying into sentosa...
,,Take the Faber License - thank me later,5.0,,"$33 for a single trip. $39 for a year of free cable car rides - called the Faber License. You do the math.

We took the Faber License for the family & have used the cable car so many times, we almost feel guilty. But that does make us come over and over to Sentosa. Even if I don’t want to go, the kids drag me along. So - good move, Sentosa.

The views from the cable car amazing. Breathtaking. Thrilling. It goes over the woods, a bus terminal, commercial buildings, through a building, over the waters, over Resort World Sentosa, over the Sentosa attractions, the Sentosa leg of the cable car gives you amazing views of the island.

You have a birds eye view of the Singapore Ports, countless ships, the beautiful waters off the coast. It is well - worth it."
,,It’s a good experience,3.0,,You take the cable car which take you above the harbour. There is bell of happiness which you can ring !!!
,,Good view,5.0,,We felt very safe even though we were high up. A wonderful view of Singapore and Sentosa Island and we could see the storm clouds roll in.

,,great views of Mount Faber,5.0,,"We had a round ticket that took us up to Mount Faber and also to Santosa and the views across the harbour were great. As ever, exits are through the gift shops but we were able to get a couple of souvenirs not seen in other gift shops. A worthwhile trip."
,,2 for a View,5.0,,"They were very organised getting you on & off the actual cable car but we were super lucky & as we had arrived early we were near the front of the queue. There was only 1 person processing tourists, who at the best of times need confirmation as to what they are booking and where they are going...that poor woman I am glad she couldn't see the length of the queue...eek. The cable car was great....clean, airy, stable and a great view."
,,Sentosa by Cable Car,4.0,,Enjoyed the trip across from Mt Faber on the cable car had a great day at Sentosa Island late night back after watching the light and laser show ofv the beach. Well worth the trip we were advised to get off at Harbourfront station on the way back as there were more taxis available than going onto the next stop at Mt Faber. Great views
,,Spectacular views,4.0,,"The Cable Car offers great views but is also a good way to visit Sentosa Island. Our ticket allowed us to travel on the additional cable cars on the island. We didn't realise that you had to alight on the Skyscraper stop to get a taxi back to the city, but they were kind enough to let us back on at Mount Faber to go back! Tickets are available at Mount Faber if not organised beforehand and they offer combination tickets to other attractions."
,,Very good,4.0,,"Excellent experience. Just double check where you are going. Fantastic at night. The lights at night were amazing , well worth seeing."
,,Attractive way to see all tge city,5.0,,There are a few lines connecting mainland with Sentosa. A chance to see all the island and shouldn't be missed.

,,EXCELLENT VIEW,5.0,,I heat a excellent view of the city from the top of the cable car when I was going to sentosa island tour.
,,A GREAT WAY TO REACH SENTOSA ISLAND OR UNIVERSAL STUDIOS WITH A GREAT VIEW !,5.0,,"I stayed 8 nights in Singapore in May 2018. I took this chance to come to Universal Studio (by using the Sentosa Express) and twice to Sentosa Island by cable car. The view is absolutely incredible from there and should really not be missed. You will pay 35 Singapor dollars from Harbour Front Station, having then also the possibility to use the cable car located on Sentosa Island, which I will advise you to do. You will also see some dolphins from you cabin, upon arriving over Santosa Island !!! I will soon add some photos for you to see what I'm talking about. This transport is fast, safe, efficient and definitively unusual !

,,From Sentosa to the mainland,5.0,,"Plenty of frequency,even at busy times,Great view over the island and to Singapore.We had bought a three event ticket,and with a $10 topup gave us the ride on the cablecar."
,,Just WOW,5.0,,"If you you’re going over to Sentosa for the universal studios or for just sight seeing, you need to at least take the cable car over at least once.. what a view. This is a must see and do."
,,"Best view, worth doing",5.0,,"Nice view, value for money ( buy tickets from agent, almost half price) Safe for kids and old people"
,,Clean and offers a great view of the island. Efficient service by staff.,4.0,,As cable cars go they are clean and view is great of the island and from a good height. There may be queues on buying tickets but it is to be expected. You also get a another ride when on island on a linked cable ride.
,,As good as before,4.0,,Always like to take the cable car to Sentosa. Brought friends took the cable car from Sentosa to Mount Faber and back to Sentosa. A must try if you were in Sentosa or Mount Faber.
,,Great!,5.0,,This is just a fun experience. I love taking my visitors on this over to Sentosa so they get that amazing view.
,,"fun, nice views",4.0,,"Singapore is a pretty flat place, so it was nice to get up and see the view of Sentosa and the cruise ships below. There's really not much at the top, from what I saw. We had a drink, enjoyed the vantage point, and then rode back down. I would not put it on a par with going up The Peak in Hong Kong. But I'm not sorry we went."
,,Way to go,4.0,,From the top of the Mount to Sentosa this is the way to go I think there’s 5 stations which you can on and off depending on the attractions you wish to see the last section you’ll see the beaches We found the best seat was facing the Island Great views of the whole island a gotta do
,,good view,5.0,,this cable car connects sentosa to mt faber . we had taken a round trip fromsentosa middle station and back .the 15 minute ride was so relaxing in the afternoon after hectic sight seeing in sentosa .well worth the money
,,Have an Experience!,4.0,,Stunning view from the cable car. Take Cable car to Santosa Island from the City instead of going through MRT/Road.
,,Great views,4.0,,"Best way to get into Sentosa island. If you require a taxi back, get off on the middle stop and catch one from the mall as there will be no taxi on the mountain, unless you specially call for one."
,,Great views but not air conditioned.,4.0,,"The Singapore Cable Cars provide some great views but the cars are not air conditioned. Ticketing can be very slow even if you prepurchased online. Once you have your tickets, access to the cable cars at the various stations is quite easy. Don't bother with the add-on meal tickets as they can only be used at specific station, at specific time, and table may not be available, and food is not great."
,,Wow what a view,5.0,,"We took this amazing cable car ride to Sentosa from Mount Faber Peak to Sentosa Island.There are more than 100 cabins spanning almost 5 km on Mt Faber and Sentosa linThe cable car ride offers you a 360 degree aerial and visual treat to Sentosa Harbour and
the Resort Island. A great place to go with a family, but be prepared to spend a day there a d I suggest you research Santosa before you go to be aware whats available....a butterfly house, Universal Studios, Insect Ki gdom and Fort Canning where the British used the fort
as headquarters after the Japanese invasion till 1945 to name a few attractions. Clark"
,,Best view of Harbourfront,5.0,,You can view harbourfront from this cables car. Very nice staff. You can go sentosa island also with this cable car
,,nice way to reach sentosa,5.0,,its a small ride approx 15 mins but its a experience to reach sentosa by the same. 6 pax max in a capsule
,,Definitely worth it.,4.0,,"Loved it. My daughter, 7, was a little nervous but loved it in the end. We joined it at Harbourfront to go to Sentosa. Sign posts not obvious from Vivocity but we found it in the end. The deal at their office for Universal, Aquarium and unlimited Cable car was the best I had seen too - unfortunately I had already got the Hipopass but would know next time. The best bit was when you took off. Also try for sunset."
,,U can see whole of sentosa,5.0,,A must must ride for entering Sentosa - this is the longest and highest cable Car I have ever experienced. The view from the top most point is wonderful and enjoyable.
,,Thrill,4.0,,"We did the sentosa island cable car ,must say was thoroughly impressed
The view is exhilarating from the top ,aerial view of the entire sentosa island
Looking down is thrilling ,quite a distance up in the sky
Was included in the any 3 ride pass
Would recommend take the longer cable car ride from sentosa station to the island ,it's a pretty nice experience"
,,An Exciting Ride,5.0,,"We toured the city, then used the Cable Car to head to the Universal Studios across the bay. What an incredible ride, I highly recommend it."
,,Experience of a lifetime,5.0,,"The view from here is spectacular, especially at night. You can see the cruise stationed in the harbour as well as the beaches in Sentosa. Price is a bit more compared to monorail but its worth it."
,,Fun way to travel,4.0,,We took the cable car from Harbourfront to Sentosa. Great view going over the water. I don't think you'd see anything more by going up to Mount Faber. It was $33 each return or $35 each including the other cable car line on Sentosa. We were glad we paid the extra $2 each as that saved us a lot of walking in the heat up to Siloso fort and back again. Recommend as a different way to travel across to Sentosa.
,,Not to be missed..,5.0,,"Birds eye view of Singapore, with Sentosa at one end and Mt Faber at the other. Buy tickets in advance to save but be prepared to still queue when you get there. Plenty of photo opportunities ."
,,Fly to Sentosa! 5 year old loved it!,5.0,,"We took a grab back, but this was an adventure to get to Sentosa island! I am scared of heights, but still enjoyed this experience!

,,Great ride,4.0,,"I love the service so much , however some of the foreign workers are very rude You get to see fantastic views , photos and much more"
,,Fun way to reach Sentosa,5.0,,"The cable car from mount faber is a fun way to reach the most sought after attraction in Singapore aka Sentosa Island, the cable is at a height that i have yet to see and one travels accross a water body to the island from the mailand, this ride gives you a chill coz of the height and vast waterbody below you. but its a smooth ride and a fun experience once you overcome your initial fear of the height"

,,Great Experience,4.0,,Took the cable car to and from Sentosa Island. Really enjoyed the experience as you get to see unbelievable sights of the island. The car were very clean and the operators were very efficient. We got a free pass on this attraction as part of the Singapore Stopover Explorer Pass and were very impressed with the attraction.
,,A Pleasant Ride!,4.0,,"We used the cable car as an easy way to get to Sentosa Island, and then continued on to visit the whole cable car network. The ability to get off one link and then visit another is a real plus. We found that the monitors ensured that we were not crowded, making the rides pleasant."
,,All you need to know about Singapore Cable Car ride,5.0,,"* There are two cable car lines in Singapore , one is Faber line and another is Sentosa line .
* Faber line starts from Mountfaber and goes till Sentosa. You can also board the cable car from Harbourfront Tower 2 floor 15 and travel up to Mountfaber, there you can spend some quality time with nature and again board back cable car which will go to Sentosa via Harbourfront.
* Ticket price is 35 SGD per head if you buy it from the ticket counter , However you can purchase tickets online with much discounted prices ( we got them worth 19SGD ). This ticket includes to and fro both.
* It is a well managed and enjoyable activity. I would recommend it totally to everyone."
,,Very nice for a family with children,4.0,,This is a very nice tour where we can see all the nice beaches and the city while traveling to different stops. Best to topup with this when you purchase Universal Studio tickets.
,,WOW!!!,5.0,,"This is definitely one of the highlights of our vacation, offering spectacular views of the entire City and Sentosa! Take time to visit the beach as well!!"
,,A wonderful ride for city views,5.0,,"A 40 minutes ride from sentosa towards the city with good aerial view of highways, serene bungalows , river is enjoyable"
,,Great experience,5.0,,The view from the cable cars are unbelievable and prices are reasonable. We went across to sentosa island and found everything efficient and relatively easy. Can be very hot though as many cable cars have no fans so be prepared.
,,Good views,5.0,,"Well maintained and safe. We enjoyed our rides to Sentosa, Merlion and other stops. Its is an alternate means of transport from Mt Faber to Sentosa. Another option is to reach Vivo City mall and take the free Sentosa express"
,,Great View!,5.0,,"I bought an adult fun pass for $55. I rode the cable car in the morning - I made sure I was there by 8:45am when tickets go on sale, then I rode it again at night. With the fun pass I also got 2 “sides” so I had the buffet dinner which was average then saw the Wings of Times show which was good (if you have small children note there is fire, fireworks & some loud noises that may frighten them but in saying that there were plenty of kids there). It’s also very busy there so give yourself plenty of time especially with transport after the show. The cable car ride was good."
,,Good experience,4.0,,Good way to get to Sentosa Island. Enjoyed the view and the slow leisurely ride. Lots of fun for kids to see Sentosa from the air too.
,,Head for Heights,4.0,,"Great way to get over to Sentosa Island and enjoy 360 degree views of the locality.
However if you don't handle heights too well, then I would not recommend this form of travel over to the island - the cable does rock and wobble a little bit.
Good value and different form of transport in getting to the Sentosa."
,,Head for heights!,5.0,,"I bought the family round trip with extra excursions on the island. Bad move, my wife didn't take well to the cable car, itw as a one way experience for her, but me and the kids love it. Its goes very very high, but if you're careful doesn't shake too much. An interesting route to Sentosa, also known as ""Pleasure Island."""
,,Nice way to go to Sentosa,5.0,,A not so great experience for those with fear of heights but definitely a unique experience. You can have a great view up there.
,,Just extraordinary,1.0,,"Most fantastic view I have ever seen ,Just incredible and with one day pass it's most economic to go to sentosa island ."
,,Very nice view of Singapore,4.0,,Very nice and friendly staff I wish they had air conditioning it’s a nice ride the view is incredible
,,Great way to view the city,5.0,,"i dont like heights but the ride was incredibly smooth.
There are 2 stages one is the city and for a little extra you can go to sentosa island which we did.
you can get out and have a walk around do activities then hop back on and it is convenient location close to transport.
Great for families"
,,now thios is a cable car ride,5.0,,What a thrill! My stomach turned when we were launched from the bay and the height was scary. Great way to access Sentosa and we finished the day with drinks from Mt Faber the highest point of the cable car
,,Exciting way to arrive on Sentosa.,5.0,,"After arriving at the MRT station NE 1 from Little India station NE 7 (12mins) we followed the signs for exit B & the Harbour front cable car station. We first took the cable car to Mount Faber, being a group of 8 we had a car to ourselves. We got out of the car at Mount Faber to have a look around & to ring the bell of happiness, on re-entering we took the cable car right across to Sentosa island passing through Harbourfront station. On reaching the island we jumped onto the Sentosa line which took us to Siloso point. After visiting Fort Siloso via Fort Siloso sky walk (Free) we took the cable car back across the island to Merlion station. After a long day on the island using the monorail & beach tram (Free) to get around we returned to Merlion station & took the Sentosa line cable car to Ibiah lookout then transfered to the Mount Faber line back to Harbour front. Well worth buying the roundtrip ticket as the views from the car are both sensational day & night."
,,Singapore Stopover holiday Package,3.0,,"So this was a solo trip that I was taking to Thailand and had booked myself on Singapore Airlines, the good things is that one can opt for something called as Singapore Stopover Holiday - which for travellers from India costs about USD78, and you get accommodation, and lots of entry passes at Singapore including the cable care ride. Best is if one wants to save time get to the Maritime Square Tower 2, to get on to the cable car & you can ride this to get into Sentosa. Now the thing is read clearly for signs which says queue for redemption. And these are not so usually easy to find on many of these pass inclusions that SSH has. And its just a cable car, if you have a child in you, maybe you could ride it, get some views of passing over some of the bay areas, and over a bit of Sentosa, otherwise give this a skip. You could also think of this as a ride to Sentosa as it would other wise cost you time and money too. Nothing really great about it though. While coming back you can either come back to the same place, look if your pass says round way, if it does (which is the case with SSH pass holders) then you can come back to the same location you started the ride and take a taxi. I rather took a cab from Sentosa, as it cost me the same to get back to my hotel from Sentosa directly, just saved on some time."
,,Truly a great experience.,5.0,,This fabulous experience was part of our Sentosa Island Tour with RMG. Truly amazing. Coming down in the cable car from Faber Peak you enjoy views of the hill top park before launching out over the worlds busiest harbour. Truly amazing and breathtaking ......excellent way to see and get to Sentosa Island.
,,Superb,5.0,,"Everyone should experience cable car to Sentosa Islands, its beautiful, the only cable car in the world which crosses across Cruise station. Its amazing......."
,,Slightly overpriced and worth going once,4.0,,used the cable car for our sentosa trip. quite fun...great views...starbucks at the destination point.
,,"Love the views, shame about no air conditioning",4.0,,The cable cars were really enjoyable and gave you great views of Singapore and Sentosa. It was 35 degrees while we were there and having no air conditioning in the cars was a tad unbearable at times especially when coming close to each station and sitting in them going round before heading out again. Don't know how they would do the air conditioning which is a shame since it can get quite hot and stuffy in the cable cars.
,,The best transportation mean to get to Sentosa,5.0,,"We took the ride on both cable car lines to experience Sentosa island ina compact way:-). Very safe, not bumpy at all despite the thunderstorms striking here and there. What makes fun are some passengers ordering the dinner to the cable car (and riding in both directions here and there) :-)."
,,Cable car,5.0,,"Breathtaking view from the cable car, moving at a comfortable pace lets us enjoy the ride and views all around."
,,Faber Park and Sentosa Island,4.0,,"Reasonable price and able to get over to the island, plenty for the children on the island. Plus the cable car went up to Faber Park and that gave very good views of Singapore and Sentosa Island"
,,Cool,5.0,,Although a little pricey its a trip you need to do at least once to get to Sentosa. Just be careful they are pretty ruthless you will only get a complete round trip especially for the Sentosa line which is a little painful as it would have been good to use it to commute around the island as a hop on hop off for the day.
,,Singapore Cable car and Sentosa Island,5.0,,The cable car is a must. The view is fantastic and great pictures of the harbor and city can be taken we paid for a round trip and it was worth it. You can take the next cable car down to Sentosa beach. They have a little ice cream outlet at the station serving coconut ice cream that is to die for. It i served in a coconut shell. We had planned on going zip lining but upon seeing that they did not have helmets for the customers we changed our minds. All and all though it is a great way to spend a day.
,,The most inefficient (slow) operation of a cable car I have seen in my life,1.0,,"It's a small distance and a nice view.
You know that in advance. What you don't know is that Dopoelmayer obviously didn't train the personell on how to operate a cable car in an efficient way, meaning moving a maximum of people as quick as possible.
They will let empty and almost empty cable cars pass while there' s a line of a 100m of people waiting.

I am used to much more efficient operations from skiing in Austrian."
,,Good View,4.0,,Good way to get to Sentosa Island. Enjoyed the view and the slow leisurely ride. Like all things in Singapore they are clean
,,Super fun,5.0,,A great trip across the two lines - which is well worth it. Sentosa car is good too and it is all worth the journey. Catch a cab up to Faber then go to Sentosa line and fluff around there too. You can then catch the free train back to the mainland.
,,Views,4.0,,If it's your first time on a cable car then you should try this. Bit boring for us although the views are spectacular. Alot to do as well at each stop.
,,Just spectacular!,5.0,,"Thoroughly enjoyed the Cable Car experience - the views were fantastic - what else can one say. If you want the view then take the Cable Car.
P.S. I've got to say however, that I don't think I would indulge the Meal option. But that's just me."
,,Spectacular Views,5.0,,"The cable car ride was awesome, though there were pretty long queues.... i guess going on a Sunday was not exactly the best idea. That being said, we really enjoyed the ride. You get a great view of the city and the ride is pretty comfortable (not recommended in the afternoon), since the sun can be rather harsh. This is one of the fun ways to get to Sentosa (or back) or to Mount Faber."
,,"Best View of city, great way to reach Santosa",4.0,,"Chilled out awesome vibe, what we did differently was to reach Santosa using the cable cars and had pre booked the tickets to and fro for the same. While Santosa tickets will offer various options to chose from a list of rides ... One must watch the sound and light show highly recommended, one of the best I have seen in the whole world. Santosa is full of options, try starting early in the day to make most out of your ticket and come back using the cable cars. Must see the Wings of Fire, probably one of the best light and sound show in world and war a Preety setting to sit outdoors and enjoying the show."
,,The view,4.0,,We had one day for going home to spend in Singapore. We feel lazy so take the cable car. Little bit of waiting but really good. Recommend.
,,Book online to skip the queue,5.0,,The station of cable car is little far from the MRT station (walk through the shopping center) and expect to wait in line (about 15minutes) or book online. But much better view from cable car than from the crowded sentosa train (we went there on sunday)
,,Great ride and views,4.0,,We decided to take the cable car to Sentosa Island and so glad we did. It gave us great views of the surrounding area and was very relaxing. A nice way to soak up the scenery.
,,Spectacular View and Transport,4.0,,"See my 'Faber park' review.
The cablecar allows you to reach Sentosa. You can not buy oneway ticket.
The cable car last boarding is at 21:30 (re-check it).
The station is at Faber park. You can order romantic meal and enjoy additional attraction.
Online booking is definitly cheaper."
,,Not worth the visit,2.0,,"Expensive, I understand how the price is build and it's ok, but at the end of the day I just feel like the attraction itself so as views were just ""whatever"". (Singapore Flyer was way better). Staff was very polite and helpful."
,,Great views and awesome light and water show,5.0,,"This cable car gave you great views of singapore and sentosa Isalnd. You can then use it on the island to get to other attractions. We spent the afternoon looking at the army tunnels, climbing the Merlion, and then waiting for the night light and water show which was a highlight!"
,,Cable Car,5.0,,"This was the one thing that i wanted to do while in Singapore and it was fantastic, i loved it from go to woe...:) the view was awesome and once again it was Clean and safe, a good speed in which to take the view in:"
,,A must do!,5.0,,"I am not a fan of heights, but this was a great experience and opportunity to see the Singapore skyline. We did an early morning trip due to the heat and humidity. I would recommend this."
,,A great little trip over to Sentosa Island,4.0,,I enjoyed taking the cable-car over to Sentosa Island and return. Great views and crossing the harbour area was great as we went right over the top of a docked cruise ship. It's a little pricey but wasn't crowded or busy.
,,Awesome views!!!,5.0,,This is such a great experience. We did it on day one and got a good overview of the city. Definitely recommended. Lots of fun for kids to see Sentosa from the air too.
,,Wonderful experience,4.0,,"I recently took the round trip cable car that runs within Sentosa island. I enjoyed the view from the cable car which included Universal studio, nice beaches and green tree top. There was not much crowd on the day I visited but I was told there will be waiting time on some special days. If you have never been on a cable car and not afraid of heights, you must try this."
,,Good mode od transport to go to Sentosa,5.0,,Cable car is good way of transport to Sentosa island. I will recommend you to get to and fro ticket with which you can take the cable car ride inside Sentosa too. The Monorail can also be accessed from Imbiah lookout to go to other attractions.
,,Very interesting,4.0,,I ride it from sentosa island.You can see everything from up.The cable car is ver clean and safe.You pass by the sea and you can see the boats snd sentosa island.You can reach it by Mrt the purple line till you reach last stop the harbour point.It was a very nice experience.
,,cable car trip at Sentossa,5.0,,"The trip was good.The cable car was good,safe & goeas over the important places at Sentossa Island.One can purchase the tickets,online or at the counter at the island."
,,Nice views,5.0,,Little pricey but great activity and beautiful Sentosa Island. I recommend buying a package which covers 2-4 activities as well - definitely value of money.
,,Good,4.0,,First u go to harbour front station with MRT then buy ticket 33 SGD for round trip .by buying this ticket u can go faber peak first and then go to sentosa u can use internall cable car in sentosa with this ticket
,,Good experience,5.0,,"It was easy to redeem our voucher that was included in Singapore Airlines Explorer Pass that we bought. With this pass we got to take the cable car from, 109 Mount Faber Road. You get on at Mount Faber, it take you to another stop which you can get off or stay on to continue to Sentosa. It is worth taking it from Mount Faber because you get to see two sets of scenery. The scenery is over the waters and it is beautiful! We took the cable car around 5:30pm the sun was starting to set and it was great! There is no air conditioning, it is open air, the doors have large slits to let in the air from outside. Note: It is free to take the tram out from Sentosa, it takes you to Vivo, a large mall, go down two escalators to the public transportation area. While at Vivo, you can go to Irvins which is in Basement 1 or 2, to buy Salted Egg Potato chips, casava chips, or fried fish skins...super yummy!"
,,You must do this!,5.0,,"I loved this. We got a ticket to do the whole lot and enjoyed the views, and the short walks around where the stations were located. We did it during the day, and the views were lovely. I would've loved to have done it again one evening but we didn't get the time."
,,BEST VIEW IN SINGAPORE,5.0,,I can't highly recommend enough to ensure you do this. This is a must and you need to do this. The views are amazing and your photography part of yourself will love this.
,,Very nice view,5.0,,"The view is very nice ideally one should go from harbor front till sentosa. The ticketing system is easy, but there is only one drawback. One has to take to and fro tickets one way ticket is not there."
,,Brilliant views,5.0,,"The cable car experience was brilliant and well organised as are most things in Singapore! We booked online and tickets are valid for up to 60 days...saved a little bit of money.
We didn’t have to queue at all for any of the cable cars.
Shop at the Sentosa stop was surprisingly good.
We didn’t spend much time on Sentosa due to time constraints and basically just went for the cable car experience. It was well worth it. Easy journey from harbour side mrt station. We combined this trip with a visit to Chinatown as it was only 2 stops away."
,,So high!,5.0,,This is a superb ride you see everything along the dock lands and the island too. We climbed to the top to ride and this was a great view
,,A regular family activity with visitors,5.0,,"This is a lovely way to see the south part of the island and start a morning or afternoon over to Sentosa. Get on/off at Mount Faber National Park, Harbourfront Mall or Sentosa or just stay on for the whole ride. The kids love it! Bring a drink though as there's just a small fan in the cars and it does get hot and stuffy!"
,,if it is your first time to sentoza try going with it,5.0,,"it was a very nice trip through the cable car to sentoza island and the view was amazing , seeing the whole island and the attractions below you especially the dolphins as they perform was a nice areal view"
,,Scary,1.0,,My friend d convinced me to do this. Ride was smooth but it is so high I couldn't look!navoid this attraction if you dislike heights
,,1 time for the view,4.0,,"We had taken single sided cabel car to reach Sentosa -butterfly park.

View is amazing, we waited for about 5 minutes to get into cabel car.

Sentosa has also got multiple MTC which run for free of cost at 2 terminals from universal to wings of time (stop). Find the right plan if you want to skip cabel car."
,,Neat mode of transportation.,3.0,,"I wouldn't say this is a ""must-see"", however, if you want to visit the beach in Singapore, then I would recommend the Cable Car as a way to get there with some nice views along the way. The experience is unique, but a lot of the views are quite industrial. Take a look at my photos to see what I mean."
,,CABLE CAR Shortcut to SENTOSA ISLAND !!!!,4.0,,"In order to reach for Luge ride, Butterflr//Inset Kingdom directly and not via road where the car will take you till sentosa and then internal sentosa bus will take you places, then we should use CABLE CAR which are part of tourist attraction.

A driver will take you the hill and thne max 4 to 4 person board cable car which will directly take you to Sentosa island with magnificent view of PORTS, Harbour , Internal road and the cool Internal CABLE CAR station, you need to drop at second station.

A mesmerizing experience for every traveller and use each opportunity to make your trip memorable."
,,Don’t waste your money,2.0,,"We were led to believe that the cable car was the best way to get to Universal Studios on Sentosa. It’s definitely the most expensive and the lengthiest and if you like long queues and standing out in the heat, then definitely pay the exorbitant entrance fee.

We booked online but you still have to stand in line at the ground floor of the station house to collect you actual paper ticket. Then more queueing at the top of the station house as you wait for the cable car to arrive. Granted, the views from the cable car are spectacular and our kids loved the ride, but it was very quick and we were soon on a Sentosa and walking down a long hill to the bus stop to wait 15-minutes for the Universal Studios bus, which is a misnomer as the bus serves ALL attractions so it was jammed packed. A 10 minute hard fought bus ride later we arrived at our destination.

We discovered too late that the last cable car departs Sentosa at 6:30 pm (seriously?) so we had to find an alternative route off Sentosa which was when we discovered that a regular city bus runs from the mainland directly to Universal Studios and back. And there was no charge back to the mainland (you only pay for the service to Sentosa).

So, in conclusion, don’t waste your time or money taking the cable car - take the bus. It will only cost you a $1 or $2 and will take you far less time while being a whole lot more comfortable."
,,A great way to see Sentosa and Harbourfront on a sunny day,5.0,,"Weather was good today, made a on the spot decision (说走就走) to take a taxi ride to Mount Faber Cable Car Station. It was almost 3 years since our last ride when we were back to Singapore for a month. The queue was not long even though it is on a Saturday. Nevertheless, it is still the most expensive way to enter Sentosa.

Initially a little apprehensive about riding in the sky (great heights), both kids got over their fear and loved the ride a lot. For us parents, it is a joy to see their happy faces.

For residents in Singapore, suggest that you can consider getting an annual membership (SGD 39 per individual and SGD 135 for a family of four), taking a ride every quarter will more than pay for your membership fee.

Looking forward to another cable car ride with my kids in the next few weeks. Will plan for a night time ride."
,,Good views,4.0,,"The views are great from the cable car, but not an activity for those with a fear of heights. Not much to do on Sentosa unless you want to spend time on the rides."
,,Cool way to get around,4.0,,"Super clean , super efficient and a nice way to see Singapore from up high. We went from the mainland to Centosa Island with the cable cars. Cool experience."
,,Singapore Cable Car to Sentosa Island,5.0,,"You can drive to Sentosa Island, but I highly recommend taking the cable car ride. The view is fantastic."
,,Breathtaking View!,5.0,,"Even though it was rather a short trip, we had a thrilling experience watching the gorgeous view of Sentosa Island. We got a round trip ticket but only used one way. Perhaps next time, we can enjoy the ride for longer."
,,Very Interesting,5.0,,Take a day to see and do Sentosa Island. Take a cab to Faber Peak and buy a day pass on the cable car. You'll have a fantastic elevated ride across to Sentosa Island and a couple cable car routes on the island.
,,Good way to see the area,4.0,,We brought a all day pass and went around a few times - If you are going to be in the area a few days or more - You can upgrade for a very nominal cost - But NOTE as a visitor you need your passport with you
,,Very nice !,5.0,,"Very beautiful !
A very nice place to visit when u r in singapore...it is a gondola lift from mount Faber to sentosa island....from it , u can have beautiful view .... it is mainly machine operated system...it is totally safe and no need to be panic for anything...it have 6 stations in between....don't forget to enjoy cable car....."
,,Great way to explore!,5.0,,"A must for sightseeing, photo op for picture taking, and seeing the surroundings in a different way!"
,,Good View,5.0,,"Good way to Sentosa, however taxi is the only way to it. The views are excellent as you cross the water."
,,Awesome experience,4.0,,"Well this was not the longest cable car in which I travelled because I found Genting Highland, Malaysia one is longest one compare to Singapore Cable Car. But both the cable car will give you a different experience. Malaysia one pass over the hills and Singapore one pass over the sea."
,,Great view - good choice,5.0,,It was a nice day to go to Sentosa. I decided to go with the cable car incl. Mt. Faber. It was a nice day and I can recommend the trip.
,,Fly through the Sky@Singapore,4.0,,"The Cable car is one of the many Tourist Attractions in Singapore.
Accessible from 5 or 6 different stations, the Cable Car gives a very different view of the Singapore Skyline and Island as a Whole.
We took the Cable car from Faber Station. Its the top most station on the Singapore City side and connects to the Sentosa Island Station.
From this hill, you get to see the Port side of Singapore and Sentosa.
Amazing View of the Island, Waterpark, Roads and other buildings around.
I would say it is an experience worth the Price.
8 people can accommodate in one Car.
Water and Washroom facility is available.
Small Store selling Souvenir and food Items.
Must Visit once at-least."
,,Amazing views,4.0,,"A little pricy (around SD$23 pp if I remember correctly) but well worth the price. We joined at Vivo City and bought return tickets that got us to Sentosa, over to Mount Faber and back to Vivo City again. We had (quite some) difficulty finding the cable car building when we arrived at Vivo and also had some difficulty understanding what tickets to buy. Assuming you are going to visit Sentosa as well, I would recommend paying an extra couple of dollars for the Sentosa cable car as well because it takes you to many of the attractions in the middle and Fort Siloso end of the island. Definitely a highlight of our trip."
,,Great views of SG!,5.0,,"Took the cable car from Mount Faber all the way to Sentosa Island and return to Mount Faber. Stopped off at Sentosa for a quick walk about and paddle in the sea. Lots of attractions on Sentosa, inluding water park, lady river, universal, dolphins, Merlion, many eating places and lovely walks through gardens. Cable cars are modern and safe to ride, good photo opportunities from the cable car. Cost is dependent on the package but basic ride approx £25."
,,Up in the air !,5.0,,"The cable cars are excellent for the views everyone is able to enjoy, swaying gently in the breeze it offers a rare opportunity to gain different views of Singapore, I am glad to have taken this rae opportunity."
,,Fun Cable car ride with nice views,5.0,,You can use this cable car to get to Sentosa Island and it provides some stunning views of the area. Fun way to get an Ariel view of Singapore.
,,Only a short ride,4.0,,Only a short ride great views. for us made more intresting as we passed over the top of our cruise ship
,,Great Views.....,5.0,,Must to do when visiting Sansosa Island.... great experience would definately recommend to add this to your itineraries.
,,A must when in Singapore,5.0,,The views are spectacular when on the way to the island and there is a tourist ticket that allows use of the system. After travelling down from Faber Peak you need to take the cable car to Fort Siloso. This is an excellent historical experience - particurly the Surrender Rooms. Also there are no charges for visiting the fort.
,,Cable Car,4.0,,"It runs from Mount Faber via vivo City to Sentosa Island. When using the ropeway there was no queue, the ticket is expensive."
,,Not scary at all!,5.0,,I'm really scared of heights and was very nervous about doing this. The experience was great! I found this the smoothest gondola I've been on. The views are stunning. There are 3 segments to it depending on where you need to go to on santosa. Was clean and very well organised. This really is a must do.
,,Nice views,4.0,,"For experience and beautiful aerial views of city, it is worth taking a ride. A cheaper option is to take the round trip ride on Sentosa (S$13 vs S$33 for city trip)."
,,High,5.0,,Cable cars are not my thing but this one was smooth and a great way to see different views. Tickets are reasonable and we spent a pleasant day touring around Sentosa island via the cable car.
,,Fab day out,5.0,,There was so much to do could have spent longer there is a Beach if you want to spend so time relaxing.
,,Great way to get around the island.,5.0,,"We purchased a round trip ticket (can only leave from each station once) and it was the perfect way to get around the island. There are cheaper ways, but we had a great view the whole time and it wasnt really busy either.

If you’re happy spending a little extra to get around, definitely recommend it."
,,The views are spectacular,5.0,,This is THE way to get to Sentosa Island. We found it to be lots of fun and took it several times during our stay. The city lights at night are different from the views during the day and it goes slow enough that you can take some great pictures and really take in the sights. I highly recommend this one.
,,Great views across Singapore,4.0,,"I’m not great with heights now, but decided we should do the cable car trip. I purchased the round trip tickets ,at a discount, off the internet before we travelled. Think it was about 40% discount so a good deal. We travelled up to Mount Faber and took the cable car from there over to Sentosa. The day we travelled, there were hardly any people going - so no queues. Got the car to ourselves on all the journeys. The views across Singapore are great, gets up quite high at one point but I just focused on the views. We got off at Sentosa but rejoined later and travelled along Sentosa, then back across to Mount Faber. Recommend the trip, worth going for the views"
,,Broke down,2.0,,"The view from the cable car is great. We caught it up to mount Fabre, and then across to the island. It was relatively quiet do we had a carriage to ourselves which was nice.
Unfortunately we were unable to catch it back from the island to the main land as they had stopped it for some reason. Staff were not helpful about how to catch the bus back with no one directing people to where they needed to go to get the bus. Only a sign at the cable car announced the service outage with staff watching people walk up to read the sign rather than helping direct and explain what was happening. We ended up getting an Uber off the island as we had no idea how long s bus was going to be. There was no refund for the missed trip."
,,Highly excited to travel to sentosa,5.0,,Highly recommended atleast oneway to sentosa through rope car. Excited and thrilled to go above Singapore
,,Awesome way to get around,4.0,,"Great fun quietly cruising above all. A different perspective and not a rip off to ride. There are two circuits of cars, check your tickets as you can get off one and onto the other!"
,,A experience but not mind blowing,3.0,,We caught the cable car to Sentosa - the ride was brief and there was a view of the marina on the way. The operation seems to run smoothly with little or no queues.
,,A Great way to look around,5.0,,"Mount Faber cable car – A great way to look around. We arrived in Singapore late at night and so took the next day to travel by MRT to Mount Faber Park and its cable cars. Just take the MRT to The Harbourfront. The tickets are surprisingly cheap, especially when doubled up with the Sentosa Island ticket – a steal at S$22 each or about £12 each. The cable cars go really high up the mountain to a restaurant and some shops and offer some fantastic views both of the docks and waterfront and across to Sentosa and Singapore in the other direction. They are incredibly smooth cables – no rocking or jolting, and like everything in Singapore – very, very clean."
,,Expensive for just a short ride!,3.0,,Getting to the station of the cable car is not so convenient. The fare is rather expensive! and should you go from Santosa back to the waterfront be aware of getting a taxi as the queue can be very very long...we waited for more than an hour before we could get one to go back to the hotel...tiring....
,,"Has to be done if visiting Sentosa, but don't expect too much!",3.0,,"Not a patch on the Lankawi car in Malaysia, but worth a trip to say you've done it. Walked back from Sentosa along the Boardwalk, which was more enjoyable to be honest!"
,,Amazing view,5.0,,I went there very special to looking around but abit noise with Chinese groups very cloud And I can see hotel and whole city in Singapore
,,Amazing !!!,5.0,,What a view !!! This cable car is a must. If you buy a pass that allows you to jump on and off you will get to see a lot. The views are amazing. It seems to go for miles. You will not be disappointed:)
,,A must do,5.0,,This was one of my highlights of Singapore. The view are spectacular. I did a round trip which if book there is slightly more expensive.
,,Great way to reach Sentosa Island,5.0,,The ride is quite long and crosses over the harbour (above cruise ships) and glides over tree tops in which you can hear the monkeys calling to each other. You can take additional routes to reach different areas of Sentosa.
,,Time for a view,5.0,,"If you want a fantastic view of the harbour and the city, this is fantastic. There are really 3 different segments with various attractions at each stop. Well worth it."
,,A great way to see Singapore!,5.0,,This tram ride is a great way to see the other side of Singapore. It takes you from Faber Peak to Sentosa Island that is a must see attraction while in Singapore. We had a fun time riding this fully safe Tram. The tram ride starts close to from Vivo City which is the biggest shopping mall in Singapore.
,,Perfect view and easy way to sentoza island,5.0,,You can reach to sentosa island by cable car .universal Studios and acvarioum.sentosa island is the Best place to enjoy and stay
,,"If you only have a short time in Singapore, this would be a good choice",5.0,,Amazing views of Singapore. There is a hill-top bar at one end. Perfect at sunset for a cocktail and snacks.
,,Great ride (despite fear of heights!) and excellent assistance from gift shop staff member,5.0,,"I left my iPad behind on a bench seat during a visit. After a while of panicking - as it contained all my photos, etc - My wife received a phone call from a friend in Australia saying the iPad was in the gift shop. While the cable car staff had assisted by searching on the cars, a gift shop staff member, Princess, showd amazing initiative, ingenuity, IT-nous, and customer service. When the iPad was handed in to the shop Princess went to where there was wifi reception, contacted two of my Facebook Messenger contacts and the second one (in Australia) phoned my wife to say where the iPad was. Princess recognised us as soon as we walked into the shop (as she had asked my contact to send a photo), and was very excited to be able to provide the service which meant our problem was solved. Top marks to her!!"
,,a must do in Singapore,5.0,,"Great view from Faber Peak, and from the cable car across to Sentosa Island.
We just got a taxi from our hotel to the Peak, and paid for the ticket at the window, was not crowded or busy first thing in the morning.
This is a must do in Singapore."
,,Breat-taking views,5.0,,Don't worry about being 'up sold' by the ticket office - spend the extra dollars for the 'full' round trip package which lets you ride both cable cars all the way around (rather than just doing the Santosa return which is a false economy) Breath taking views - you have to do it - $66 dollars for two people.
,,Quick Sentosa Trip,4.0,,"I made somewhat of an adventure out of this; biking to the park, walking up the stairs then heading over. It’s a little pricey for a cable car and a little but of a time commitment but the views are great. The sentosa line is short but it’s still nice to see the beaches and ships. Overall I think if you have more than 3-4 days in Singapore you should add this to your list."
,,Views and views.,5.0,,Mt. Feber itself and then the tram across and back. I've done the Cable Car both times I've been to Singapore.
,,Breathtaking view,5.0,,Lovely view of Singapore from above. Great way to enjoy the harbor. I bought cable car ticket with Wings of Time attraction and I got discount.
,,cable car,5.0,,This cable car ride is a must do. going over to Santos island the views are spectacular. take the train back and then you can taxi back to hotel restuarant.
,,Great View of the Beach and City,5.0,,"I love riding cable cars. Good thing I 'own' the cable car in SG because I am alone inside, no other tourist.Great view of Sentosa and the nearby beaches/bay. Not as high and breath-taking as the Maokong Gondola in Taipei but neverthelss the experience is worth it. One can get this at a discountat 48 SG$ combined with 2 more other attractions in Sentosa, so it is a great deal for me."
,,memorable experience,5.0,,Its one of the best cable car experience for me. There are two lines for Singapore cable car so I took the cable car for sentosa beach. I started from the station and went to sentosa beach through cable car. Its highly safe and well maintained. It has capacity of 4-6 people ands decent speed. Its totally made of glass and give you beautiful view of the senotsa beach. Enjoy the ride!
,,The cabin cars deliver you to the huge amount of the entertainments.,4.0,,"I didn't like very much the view because the part of our route passed by the industrial zone. The cabins do not go very smoothly, so the trip was quite scary. We took ticket on unlimmited rides on every station (Merlion Station, Sentosa Station, Imbian and Siloso).

But this cabel cars deliver you to the Sentosa island with a lot of entertainments. We tried Adventure Cove Waterpark , Skyline Luge, Sentosa Merlion.

We tried Skyline Luge for 3 times. This is karting, so I recommend wearing shorts.

Adventure Cove Waterpark is a place where you float on inflatable ring
and then you get into the fish tunnel.

Sentosa Merlion is a Symbol of Singapore. You can get on both Merlion's head and mouth, but my favorite part is the pool behind Merlion. I highly recommend this pool. It is designed in the style of the Spanish architect Gaudi."
,,A view to Have,5.0,,A trip to Singapore is incomplete without a cable car from the harbour front to the island .. We bought tickets at the station for a return ride .. Its one of its kind trip .. enjoyed thoroughly
,,Just normal,3.0,,"WE had this ride as part of package. Not too exited, too much cost and west of time, If we new, we could have gone to gardens directly and save some time.,"
,,Ride the Cable Car to Complete your Singapore experience.,5.0,,"One of the best experience especially if you are with your family and relatives. I bought a ticket in another website that starts with the letter ""K"" and it was worth it. I do not know if I can put the name of the website here but you can just search it, it sounds like a cook, five-letter word, starting and ending with the letter ""K"".
The promo tickets were worth it. We were able to ride both the Mt. Faber line and the Sentosa line. We started from Harbourfront MRT station towards Sentosa. From Sentosa, we took a round trip in the Sentosa line. Then we went back to Mt. Faber for our lunch since the promo tickets that I bought had a lunch included in it. After our lunch, we went back to Harbourfront again using the tickets.
It was really a very wonderful experience. It will conquer your fear of traveling via cable car and think it was a first time experience. Also, the cable car can accommodate 8 people and we are 6 adults and 1 infant so most of the time, we had the cable car for ourselves. We visited Singapore last February 16-17, 2018."
,,Nice views,4.0,,We had a great experience on our way to Sentosa Island. The cable cars were clean and plenty of seating. We rode most of the say without others in our car.
,,Nice ride but once is enough,3.0,,Really nice views of Sentosa island going in but it is a shame you must buy a return ticket since it's a nice walk back to Vivo center over the boardwalk. Expensive.
,,The Connection to Sentosa Island,4.0,,The Singapore cable car provides connectivity to the amusement center of Sentosa Island. The view from the cable car is unique.
,,A very scenic and relaxing activity,5.0,,"I like the cable car because it's relaxing to be above the city. If you go after 6pm, you get a discount, and I think that is a nice time to go anyway because then you get to see both day and night views as sunset is about 7pm (the 7pm sunset is year-round in Singapore as it is close to the equator). You can also walk around the park at the top. Highly recommended."
,,Nice but very slow,4.0,,Taking the cablecar to visit Sentosa is probably the best way to go to the island but unlike all other cablecars in the world this one runs very slowly. And going to Mount Faber isn't quite as interessting as going to Sentosa.
,,Good ride but massively overpriced,3.0,,"Views are good, but not worth the price you have to pay for it. Can only buy a return ticket so there is no way of getting the ticket any cheaper."
,,Great views,5.0,,We hadn't been to Mt Faber for years but the cable car wasn't much different. Once we got to Sentosa though there were lots of changes including a new cable car route.
,,3 way cable car,4.0,,"We avail the 3 rides, sentosa, mount faber and siloso. I really enjoyed the view.. Its a great way to end up in sentosa place. They also gave us ref magnet of cable car for souvenir."
,,Cable car like elsewhere,3.0,,I know this cable car short after they finished it when I lived there in Singapore as 'Expat'. It is a comfortable way to reach 'Sentosa Island'
,,Just so you know...,5.0,,"So we took the fabulous MRT all the way to Sentosa and decided to take the Cable Car back ... well, you must pay for a round trip ticket, even if you are only going one way. So needless to say the experience for us was a bit expensive but the view from the car is great (in a clear day)."
,,New place New adventure,4.0,,"It's a new place and I had a fabulous experience - all Singapore tourists must try this and not miss it .. my advice is to take the cable car from the mountain to Santosa and from there you can reach all the attractions like Universal studios, sea life aquarium, museum ..... etc"
,,Good views,3.0,,"We were unable to buy a single way ticket and had to buy return, which was annoying. Probably a bit expensive for what it is, online tickets are much cheaper. The views are very good though."
,,Great views,4.0,,"The only thing about this Cable Car that is wrong are the people running it! The day we went was a long weekend for Chinese New Year. The cable cars take 8 people and the lifties were letting cars go with 4 people or less and the line ups were HUGE. Apart from the frustration of the operation of the lift, the view and the entrance to Sentosa were great."
,,Good family day,5.0,,"My family and i really enjoyed the cable car,kids were worried at first,panoramic views ..good afternoon for the family"
,,Great views during the ride,4.0,,Taking a trip on the cable car was an attempt to see Singapore from different angles and maybe get some photographs of the islands and beyond.
,,Another way to Sentosa Island,4.0,,"We normally drive to Sentosa, but decided to take the cable car to view the island from high. Fast service when purchase the ticket."
,,Its good but little overrated and expensive,3.0,,Singapore cable car to enter and exit Sentosa is one of the ways to commute to Sentosa. I personally felt its quite pricey and not worth. rather during the same month i visited Langkawi and i have never ever had a chance to experience one of the longest and most amazing cable cars ever that i had in Langkawi. So i could easily compare that Singapore cable car isn't worth the money and the short duration. I would rather take Sentosa express or walk to enter and exit Sentosa.
,,Fly highp,5.0,,Great experience flying high over the harbour to the Island. The process was well organised and very busy. However the cabins were clean and offered great views. A good way to get across to visit the attractions.
,,Great Attraction,4.0,,For those who have fear of heights i think they can also ride this attraction.This a great attraction as you can see and enjoy the whole city from up above. This attraction will bring you to mt faber to sentosa island.
,,Excellent Experience,5.0,,Went with all the family 5yrs to 66yrs. All felt safe and in awe of the wide variety of views. Need to carefully work out the two cable car routes.Very nice family or couples experience
,,Perfect View,4.0,,Wonderful view . Worth at least a one way ride . Perfect way to get over to the island. Try to buy tickets ahead of time because line is long.
,,Good views and plenty of rides!,4.0,,"We caught the MRT to Harbourfront and booked tickets on the cable car to Sentosa. What we didn't realise was that you get a ride up to Mount Faber Peak as well, and for a bit extra can include the Sentosa cable car. I have to admit I don't like heights but it is something I have to do! I didn't like going up to Mount Faber Peak up over the road and valley but got used to it. We had a drink in the cafe at the top (make sure you get your change!! A lot of Americans visit this cafe early on as the cable car is close to the cruise terminal, and I think that maybe it is thought we don't count our change)We then rode all the way down to Sentosa, which was fun going over the top of the cruise ships! At Sentosa we caught the Sentosa Island cable car both to Merlion and Siloso Point beach. A fascinating island - one end a bit like Disney, and the other end a quiet beach (though it does have a zip wire going over it at one point)"
,,best views,5.0,,A must do in Singapore. Great views from the top going across. Very well supervised. Safe for the whole family.
,,The whole experience was a bit meh :/,3.0,,"Guys I apologise in advance, my review might sound a bit negative for some of you given the amazing trip adviser rating for this attraction on this site. I am trying to remain unbiased during writing this review but I do need to highlight how miserable my day was probably due to some bad decisions I made along the way. So first and foremost if this is the first time you are getting on a cable car then yeah you will definitely like it. But bear in mind the ride is short... like really really short it kindda finishes before it starts. They will try to make you share the cable car with others and can fit upto 8 people in one cable car! Tried to do fit 6 passengers and a buggy with us during one of our journey. It was the most uncomfortable 3/4 mins ride in the 30 degrees heat. There is no aircon so yeah be prepared to be steamed in the heat. Although i must mention there were some weak air ventilation. If you are the second group on-boarding the cars you are most certainly going to be sitting facing the opposite direction of travel and going to miss the view. If thats ok with you considering the bucks you will be paying then yeah these are no big deal. Now the big mistake I made that ruined my day...i bought cable car return tickets from my hotel concierge, trying to be clever and avoid long queues but didn’t realise this was actually voucher and not tickets. So when I went to the cable car station they sent us to the monorail office to collect tickets. This was about 20 mins walk through two shopping malls, then another 10 mins queue to redeem the tickets from the desk then 15 mins walk back to the harbourfront station. I would recommend you buy the tickets directly from the station and avoid all the extra hassle if you can. Now somehow while getting back to the station I lost my tickets, must have dropped somewhere, this never happened to me before. I went to the ticket desk to ask if they can help me in this situation, they basically told me to bugger off! Spoke to the tour company who issued the vouchers they weren’t helpful either. I was really surprised a big company like sentosa doesn’t have any system in place to assist genuine customers in this kind of situation. I had all my other papers with me showing i paid etc. How difficult was it for them to track and ticket they issued against the vouchers and block it and reissue new ones. No idea! They sympathised and was polite but basically didn’t help me at all. Lesson for me get digital tickets where I can! Given I was there for few days I repurchased the tickets and went to sentosa. But didn’t enjoy the whole experience Probably because I was let down a bit by this whole dramatic incident and ended up spending €132 for what a 15/20 mins cable car ride for two. A return trip will cost you $33 singapore dollars."
,,Thought I would be scared but.....,5.0,,So well done and such sensational views - it really is worth it. Thought I would panic - silly me it was just wonderful.
,,Great views,5.0,,Worth at least one ride. Check the operating times as it doesn't run early mornings. You can go from Harbourfront up to Mount Faber or over to Sentosa.
,,Flying high.,5.0,,"If you go to Singapore have a ride on this cable car, what a view and very stable. plenty of places to gt a bite and drink."
,,Great Attraction,4.0,,It's was an exhilarating experience. A thrill to be up there while enjoying the amazing view. You can get off at every station and wonder around. Highly recommended.
,,Worth the $$$,5.0,,"Was a very easy ride. Comfortable and a lot less crowded than the monorail over to Sentosa Island. We had the full length travel ticket which meant you could ride on it all day if you liked. Also , it was helpful getting around Sentosa island itself"
,,Short ride,3.0,,"Take the cable car from Mt Faber only if you want to see the view (which is spectacular). Otherwise, there are cheaper ways of getting to Sentosa, like walking along the boardwalk or taking the monorail or the bus. Good to do in the evening to take in the city and harbour lights."
,,A great way to get to Sentosa,4.0,,My husband and I used the cable car to get to and from Sentosa. It’s quite costly but a nice experience and a unique way to get to and from the island. The views are good - especially of the ports and the staff are good at not filling the carts up with too many people during quieter times so you can often get a cart to yourself.
,,Great,5.0,,"There are 2 lines operating here, one connecting faber park and one with sentosa. great for a short journey from vivocity to sentosa island."
,,Slick smooth ride on a Swiss gondola,5.0,,Fun activity to do while in Singapore reasonable cost and no line ups when we were there (On a Friday). Everything looks new and clean and shiny. They must have excellent maintenance. Awesome views from the gondola...up to Mt. Faber and out to Sentosa island. Can get some great views from the ride! Recommend doing for sure while in Singapore.
,,Great view,3.0,,"Get on from Sentosa line and and than transferred to the Mount Faber line. I think very good opportunity to see sentosa like birds..
Comparing to the distance you traveled a bit pricey.. Welcome to the Singapore)))
Check website before taking tickets..
there are combined packages and quite hours discounts. Like after 6 pm cheaper..
Have good time.."
,,Fabulous,5.0,,Views are great & it's nice to peacefully go far above the hustle & bustle below. cable car to ourselves quite romantic experience.
,,Must do ride.,5.0,,"A great way to see Singapore harbour and water front, great photo opportunity, not cheap but worth it"
,,High life !,4.0,,"Took Taxi to the Cable Car , great view, second best in Singapore ( after the flyer ) ! Very good views !"
,,Great views,4.0,,"Cable car is reasonable and one way of ing to Sentosa island. Sentosa has so much to see and do. There are a few hotels to stay at also there is the fast train to ride like a monorail. Plenty of places to eat at plus there is a big food hall with variety to choose from as well plus McDonalds if need be.. Beach area to swim or a couple of bars on the ter edge as well. . There are souvineer places around, ice cream parlours, coconut drink stand, billabong m bikini bar to visit for a meal/snack, drink and play pool. Staff friendly. So much to see and do there it'# a must."
,,City and Sea views,5.0,,"Nice to travel out to Faber Peak. Very peaceful place away from the city. Nice place to have a coffee or cold drink and just relax for an hour. Great way to travel out there and superb views over the city, river and Sentosa Island"
,,Fantastic Ride,5.0,,"We thoroughly enjoyed our ride on this cable car, we went up to Mt Faber on it, then over to Sentosa and then had another ride on another cable car on the island, all on the one ticket. Great Views, friendly staff and it was easy to get to on the MRT"
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Very easy to get on and off, staff at all points are so so helpful and friendly, goes very high so probably not good if you are scared of heights but cable cars are comfortable and very sturdy feeling plus views are amazing well worth the trip"
,,View of the area,3.0,,Typical cable car with views of the area. Ok to once when in the area. The Sentosa section is very short.
,,Must to Do,5.0,,"Awesome Jaw drooping View, best way to travel to sentosa island. Easily approachable, do take a return two way pass as you dont want to miss the night view of Singapore,"
,,Exciting way to get to Sentosa!,5.0,,"Taking the cable car from Faber Peak is just one way of reaching Sentosa Island in Singapore. One may also take the MRT train or go by car. But I would recommend taking this cable car because of the scenic view it offers along the way. The ride is much shorter compared to the crystal cable car ride from Tung Chung to Launtau in Hong Kong, but exciting just the same. From the cable car, you can get a good view of Harbourfront Bay below.

A one-way ride from Faber Peak to Sentosa would cost you SG$29 (for adults). To do this, you take the Faber line (30mins), which connects with the Sentosa line from Merlion Station to Siloso Point Station (15mins). I would advise that you take the combined Mount Faber line and Sentosa line for SG$33 instead of having to buy separately for the two lines (which would cost you SG$42). Cable car is daily open from 8:45 AM to 10:00 PM."
,,What views,5.0,,A stunning way for going from Mount Faber to Sentosa. Originally built in the 1970s this is the 4th rebuild. The highest tower to give you the best views.
,,Another cable car,4.0,,Nothing very spectacular but yes a ride through the greenery and down the mountain . It is the ride to sentosa island. The time also is very less so one cannot enjoy the sights.
,,This is a cable car NETWORK!,5.0,,"The really cool thing about this kind of transportation is not just a way to get to Sentosa Island, is a mini network of a sky MRT. You can actually get off and back on at different stops. The ticket prices are not cheap, but it's worth the price to see Sentosa and walk around the various areas or even down to the beach. A must do in Singapore."
,,Good,4.0,,Amazing experience.but the time is very less.should have been to n fro .upper view is also wonderful. Can be visited for a change
,,Best view from Singapore island to Sentosa,4.0,,"One if the best way to go to Sentosa. You can take the cable cart, and fly across the sea toward Sentosa resorts.
Along the bay, thee are cruiser and boats which makes the view tremendously great. Strongly suggest to by one day unlimited ride of cable cart."
,,wow! a must do!,5.0,,"Even if your scared of heights like me, give this a go, its a smooth way to get across to or from Sentosa with great views of the Island, harbour and Sentosa. And how can you not do Singapore without doing the cable car??"
,,Great views-keep track of your journey though,4.0,,"I bought a return ticket to and from the station by the harbour which lets you go up and down Mt Faber and to Sentosa and back. Your ticket is marked on each leg, so once you have done each section your tiucket has been used and if you want another ride you need to pay more-beware.
The journey is good, with great views of the harbour and the mountain in all directions."
,,Love this,5.0,,"Cable car is just perfect

You could take the cable all the way from Mount Faber peak which is a beautiful place to hike, to Harbourfront mall which is a great place to shop and eat. Then the cable car goes further to Sentosa island.

Along the way there is this fantastic view of Keppel island. What more can you ask for.

Tip: Go with a member to buy the ticket at half price :) :) Enjoy!!"
,,Good way to view the Harbour front,4.0,,"This is a great way to view the busy harbour and also a nice way to visit Santosa Island, you will get some great pictures from within the cable cars. Only downside is that it's expensive for what it is ""a short journey"", however still worth a visit"
,,Amazing short visit to Mt. Faber,4.0,,"We never had this trip before. But for our first time, this cable car trip was amazing. We had a great time enjoying the great view both from the car and from Mt. Faber. What a hideaway."
,,rainy day fun,4.0,,"The day we had planned this trip was rainy but that suited us just fine- not too hot, no burning sun and not loads of tourists. Had a bit of trouble navigating at first, enjoyed an amazing breakfast then the segway tour- tops!"
,,breathtaking views,5.0,,Plan on spending a whole day on Sentosa Island. You can possible go here by car or bus but you would be missing out on the amazing views provided by the cable car. The wait is not too bad.
,,Great views,5.0,,The cable car offers some spectacular views over Singapore and Sentosa Island. Worth the ride to see it all.
,,Very Good,5.0,,"To reach the theme park you can travel by road, but this is much more fun and you get some amazing views of the city and other surrounding areas. But be carful, because because at every station someone will initial your ticket and you can get caught out for extra money, so make sure to plan your trip."
,,Convenient and good for pics,5.0,,This is a very scenic ride and is a must do if you have kids. You can get really good pics and it's a convenient way to travel in Sentosa.
,,excellent,5.0,,"Nice and great experience for my family, We enjoyed the ride, and the Tour adviser at Boss Hotel Gave us lot of tips which was very usefull"
,,Must visit if going to Sentosa !,5.0,,Woo ! what a wonder experience Indeed. We were with 2 kids and too a return ride from Faber Hill and back to Sentosa (did not get off) - it was a great 30 min ride over the sea and harbor. Though it costs about $29 return for adults - it worth the visit. The station is a little hard to find (need to ask around). We were also given some fridge magnets as gifts for taking 4 tickets.
,,wonderful ride,5.0,,The cable car ride is a not to be missed activity.There are different stations on the two lines and one can get down and see around the various attractions in sentosa islands.The view from the cable car is fantastic and the service is efficient
,,Great fun,5.0,,We went there last year and experienced one of the very attractive location in singapore. It is surely great fun.
,,Must see,5.0,,Was well worth the money spent we did the unlimited cable car and waterpark packages The views were absolutely breathtaking it wasn't busy the day we went and had the cars to ourself Do this attraction
,,from sky santosa view.,4.0,,go take cable both way.day time and night time great view.universal have small cable car conntacted to santosa.however ger ur camera ready .
,,Must Do Activity,5.0,,Start the cable car ride from the Mount Faber itself for a better experience. Views are beautiful. This is the best way to enter Sentosa Island. Kids loved the ride.
,,Singapore Cable Cars,5.0,,"These cable cars offer fantastic views of Sentosa and the surrounding harbors. You can even see the zipliners and the bunge jumpers, as well as the massive Merlion."
,,Good views,4.0,,A bit confusing at first and not cheap like everything in Singapore but well organized. Staff are helpful to confused tourists. We first went to see the Merlion and then took a further car down to Sentosa and the beach but it was so very hot with little shade we just got back on the cars and went up to Mount Faber but to be honest not much to see.
,,Flawless Ride with a view......,4.0,,"It was our second day at sentosa islands and during sunset we decided to take a ride from merlin station to Faber peak.
We are rewarded with beautiful viewing.
The trolley was at the highest point during the ride. The single cabin could accommodate six to eight people.
The ride was comfortable although my better half was afraid of the heights."
,,Great,5.0,,Cable cars go from mount Faber to senosta. Good ride. Good views. You can also go to merilion and fort silos.
,,Great views,4.0,,"We took the cable car one way to Sentosa Island and it was a lot of fun and gave us great views on the Island, the seaport and the city. It cost SGD29.00 per person one way."
,,Must try!!,5.0,,"Go up and try, you will see the very nice view of Singapore. Every-time I visit Sigapore, I take cable car. I feel safe and secure and trust Singapore standard always."
,,Nice ride and view,5.0,,An affordable ride and view of the Sentosa area. It's an interesting way to get there and to take pictures of the area around.
,,ADVENTOUROUS,4.0,,Cable car ride is thrilling and adventurous. This takes you to so many wonderful sights to visit in singapore.
,,"Sentosa is the antidote to rhe citie,s exuberence",5.0,,"Go after lunch, or even after breakfast, take you swim togs . Arrange to return at 1800hrs so as to see all the lights come on ,across the harbour From the best vantage point. It is very crowded weak ends, Have been many times since1944 will go again next year, to enjoy the culture, ,fun, golf, history"
,,Singapore Cable Car,3.0,,"The cable car over to Sentosa is shorter in distance
than it seems, and is very expensive for the short ride it offers. There are far less expensive ways of getting to Sentosa, and I would recommend taking one of them, such as car, taxi or bus."
,,Great Views but non-descript Harbour Front Station,3.0,,"We got the cable car from Harbour Front to Sentosa for a few hours on the island. Then on the way back, went all the way up to Mount Faber. The Sentosa and Mount Faber ends of the cable car have facilities such as gift shops, cafes, etc. But the Harbour Front area is relatively non-descript - although this may be because it is next to a large shopping centre.
A great way to begin and end a trip to Sentosa.
My only complaint was that ordering a taxi at Mount Faber proved impossible without a Singapore based mobile phone. So we walked down - which was hot, but pleasant."
,,Enjoyed nice views,4.0,,"We had stops at Sentosa and Mount Faber, enjoyed nice views. Prices could be reviewed for 'seniors'....including non residents...."
,,Good way to see part of Singapore from the air,4.0,,"There are 2 short cable car lines - 1 in Sentosa island, and the other liking Sentosa Island to Mt Faber.

We visited on a weekday afternoon when it was very quiet, and were able to ride multiple times with an unlimited ride ticket. The cars are clean and well maintained and the attendants friendly. It's a good way to view Singapore and Sentosa Island from the air.

Tip: Google Onefabergroup and buy your Sentosa tickets online for a 15% discount. If you would like multiple rides on the cable cars, but the Fly & Explore Pass which give you entry into the SEA Aquarium in Sentosa and unlimited rides on both cable car lines."
,,Nice way to go ver to Sentosa,4.0,,This is the most expensive way to get to Sentosa but certainly the most scenic and fun. It was a great way to start our day. We enjoyed it.
,,fabulous view,5.0,,"its a beautiful and breathtaking view over the jungle,sand and sea . u cant take your eye off the beauty of nature."
,,A novelty; but nothing to miss out there..,3.0,,"We took the cable car from Sentosa Island to the city late evening. The view was decent; with the city lights, traffic, bay and the buildings; but it was nothing special. One could easily give it a miss.."
,,Nice way to visit Sentosa,4.0,,I took the cable car in Singapore after a long time and it didn't disappoint me. If you are local I'll recommend to sign for annual pass because you'll get 50% discount for the visitors you bring. Go to mount faber in the evening and enjoy the time there.
,,Great way to see Singapore and go to Sentosa Island,5.0,,"This is a great way to see Singapore and get over to Sentosa Island with MGM, theme parks and lots to see and do."
,,Great if you have time,4.0,,"We had time to spare, so went on Cable Car

Enjoyed it

Very high
Very beautiful views of Singapore and Sentosa Island

But there are so many things to do in Singapore. If your days are filled with other things, dont really have to go here especially if you have been on other cable cars or places with views

But we were tired of walking, had 2-3 hours to spare, did not go to the night safari and therefore had budget availble to go on the cable car

No regrets, will cherish it"
,,Cable Car -- Good and Unique experience,4.0,,"When you visit Sentosa island in Singapore, opt Cable car option. This is around 15 minute drive to the island. Very good experience. you will be able to see an aerial view of the Sentosa, sea, Universal studio. This is a must visit when you are in Singapore"
,,Fantastic,5.0,,Great rides and great views many stop of points to wander round and see the many sites around the park.
,,A real way to fly on Singapore sky line,5.0,,"Had a trip from Sentosa island to water front over the sky .... there was no rush, so got one cabin for my family. enjoyed every moment of ride. Bought all day ticket and used cable car for primary mode of transport"
,,Good way to spend an afternoon,4.0,,"There are 2 lines, the Mount Faber Line & the Sentosa Line, they intercept at the middle station. We got a combined ticket for both at $33 each, starting at the Harbourfront Station, 15 storeys up. It's only a short walk from the Harbour Front MRT stop to the building. There is room for up to 8 people in the cable car, yet it wasn't too busy when we were there & we usually shared with another couple or a single traveller. Views are great & it's nice to peacefully go far above the hustle & bustle below. On Sentosa, be prepared to be fleeced. At the Merlion souvenir & refreshments shop a 330cl can of beer will set you back $16.00, a simple iced tea $3.50, might be worth it though, there is air-conditioning!"
,,Lovely experience,5.0,,Had a lovely ride on the cable car traveled from Harbour to Sentosa no queues and had cable car to ourselves quite romantic experience.
,,Exciting one,4.0,,"For the first time in my life, i enjoyed cable car and it was so exciting. I was looking at the ground again and again while traveling by cable car."
,,visual appeal,4.0,,the ride is must for going into the sentosa island..its comfortable and invariably part of the day package which you take for the park
,,Singapore cable car a wonderful experience,5.0,,Our two night stay in Singapore wasn’t long enough. Plenty to see and not enough time. Our visit to sentosa island on the cable car was a delight. The children age 7 and 4 loved it as much as we did. The beach area was brilliant for them and a chance to cool down on a hot day!
,,Exciting way to go to the island,5.0,,This is a fun way to go out to the island for a visit. Nice way to take some great pictures and relax.
,,Fantatsic views!,5.0,,"I am so pleased we bought unlimited cable car use for the day. The experience was amazing, the views were awesome and couldn't have seen Singapore or Sentosa Island better from any other vantage point in my opinion. Money well spent."
,,Boring,3.0,,"It is just a simple cable car ride connecting Sentosa Island to the mainland. It might be interesting for kids, but it is generally boring in nature."
,,Great Experience,4.0,,"The Cable car has 2 routes or lines - The Sentosa Line and the Mount Faber Line. The Sentosa line only takes you within the island of Sentosa, while the Mt. Faber line connects the mainland to Sentosa. We had a combined pass of both the lines. We took a cab to the Mt. Faber station, which overlooks the whole city and provides a nice view. A 15 minute ride, going over the hills, the marina and the sea, catching glimpses of the cityscape brought us to Sentosa.

The Mt. Faber line starts from a hill called Mt . Faber on the mainland and takes you over the city and into the island of Sentosa. You get great views of the city and the skyline. Being a family of 4, we had the whole car to ourselves and my kids really enjoyed the view from the top and the 15 min journey. The cars have openings to let the air in and also glass windows. Interestingly when we were coming back, it started to rain and made the whole trip quite interesting with droplets of water coming. The trip also takes you over the harbour, where you can see ships docked in Singapore. If you are lucky, you might even glimpse a nice cruise liner right under your feet as you pass by !!!

We used the Sentosa line just for fun, seeing the Merlion from up in the air, seeing the shoreline and the beach etc. However one may choose to avoid it totally."
,,Dinner,5.0,,"If you are a couple, have dinner there. Great view and food is very good. Very well organised. Book from Klook - they offer good prices for everything in Singapore"
,,Convenient and fun way to reach sentosa,3.0,,"The view is ok, the cabin inside does not allow for great picture taking. But it is a convenient way to go to sentosa and I guess quite fun too."
,,Great fun on a clear day.,5.0,,"I loved this, so did my kids. My wife was so nervous she ripped a whole bunch of hair off my leg. 10/10 would recommend."
,,Another cable car,3.0,,It is expensive to go up to Mount Faber in the cable car. It is nothing special gives a different view of Singapore. The park is good but it was so humid up there that it was unpleasant.
,,Excellent experience to view the city from a height,4.0,,"The expense is for to and fro ride. One way is about 15 to 20 minutes. It is a must for those who have never traveled in a cable car. The company representative take nice photos while boarding the cable car, which can be later purchased."
,,Scenic tour,5.0,,Beautiful cars were clean and comfortable. We always had a car to ourselves. Wonderful vision of Singapore. Peaceful and staff polite.
,,Great views over Singapore,5.0,,"The Cable car is a great way to get to Sentosa with fabulous views of Singapore, would definately recommend."
,,Excellent Ride,5.0,,Alternative way to get to Sentosa. This is my first ride to a cable car and I spend it with my family. We really enjoyed it for its great views even though it is expensive it is worth the cost. Go visit it during the day
,,Fantastic way to get to Sentosa,5.0,,Quite a long way from Singapore CBD but taxis are cheap. Interesting ride on the cable car. Lovely views of Singapore. There is a photo booth at the attraction to take your photo and then have your copy once you get off the cable car. A nice memento.
,,Don't lose your ticket,2.0,,"Pretty views. Ordered round trip tickets online and had vouchers on phone. Receives cardboard tickets that I misplaced at the other side of the island. Whereas everywhere else in the developed world they would give you a one way trip back to your departure, to replace the ticket, this company refuses. Horrible situation for my two children of 4 and 6. Terrible management for an otherwise nice attraction. Shame on you."
,,Great views,5.0,,We rode the cable car from Mt Faber to Sentosa and back. It was worth the cost for the views it afforded and as a way of getting to Sentosa.
,,It gives a good view from the top like any other cable car!,3.0,,Nothing really special except that you get a birds eye view of Singapore mainland and the approaching Sentosa Island when you go via the Cable car.
,,Wow,5.0,,"Lovely, best is must take round trip. We got the tickets online and for some discount. The view in morning was fabulous and at night extraordinary."
,,cable,5.0,,"very good quality cable cars. takes the ride over highways, buildings, sea and roads. amazing. no fear. all fun in the car."
,,A great way to see Singapore,5.0,,You can see everything from up here! This is a great service with cable cars running continually and all day and night. The cars are clean and well maintained.
,,Don’t waste your money and time,1.0,,"Don’t waste your money and time unless you use the cable car as transportation to the attraction park which is a small wanna be Orlando theme park.

Staff super impolite and you are better off by saving the $33 per adult by using the big wheel to get an overview of the city."
,,Worth doing,4.0,,A bit 'been there done that' but you've got to do it! Great views and just go with the flow! Great look back to the city and over the port. If there's a cruise liner you get to go right over the top which is fun in so far as you're pleased to be on land rather than the cruise boat!
,,Great way to head to Sentosa,4.0,,A ride from Mount Faber over the Keppel Harbour to Sentosa. great way to start your day and enjoy the views while en route to your activities in Sentosa or the other way around.
,,Perfect way to capture the skyline.,4.0,,The cable car takes you to Sentosa Island and it gives one a great view of the area.Suggest it is caught at Henderson Waves to maximise the ride.
,,Great in the day and night,5.0,,We took two rides on the cable car. One during the night time and the second to get to Samosa island during the day. The views were great on both occasions. If you are going to the island you will need to get on a second cable car to complete your journey to either visit Samosa beach or to go to see the Merlion.
,,Nice stroll,3.0,,Went there on a recommendation from a fellow tourist and also because I went to eat at 328 Katong Laksa. It was close walking distance from there. It was a very cloudy day with rain so not an ideal day to visit. Lots of families in the area.
,,fantastic experience,5.0,,One can spend hours going up and down in these cars looking down at the high ship activity below. Its beautiful both at night and in day times.
,,Nice view,4.0,,We took the cable car to get to and back from Sentosa Island. Great views during the day crossing over. Very clean and if going as a couple normally you get your own car or as a group up to 8 people. We took the car back in the evening and the sky line was totally different and worth it.
,,Have Fun,5.0,,It is a good place to have fun and very romantic with safe. We enjoyed the view of this lovely city.
,,Amazing views!,5.0,,"We caught the Cable Car from Mount Faber, which is only a $7 taxi ride from Chinatown. The views are amazing! and the ride across to Sentosa is very pretty. The Senotsa station is in the middle of the island, so just a ride down several escalators will have you at the Merlion statue, Monorail station and ticket offices for the various attractions. We caught the monorail down to beach station and had lunch at one of the beachfront bars. After eating, we made our way back up to the SEA life aquarium before catching the cable car back to the main island.
This is a good option for travelling to Sentosa is you are not staying there. Would definitely recommend!"
,,Excellent Views,5.0,,"This cable car provides excellent views of Sentosa Island & the Harbour Front. Very smooth ride in modern & super clean cars. If you’re scared of heights, don’t despair, just jump on & close your eyes, you won’t even feel a thing."
,,Back for more,4.0,,"The original cable car is always a fun way to get across to Sentosa island. Came here again recently with the intention of renewing the annual family membership. Unfortunately the membership office only opens around 11am - not sure why they're so late - so they weren't opened when we arrived at 9.30... So we decided to head over to Sentosa and renew at the other cable car office a bit later on. The annual membership for the family is pretty good value, although you do get a bit sick of the cable car after a while."
,,Delightful trip to Sentosa Island,3.0,,"You can take the MRT but better still is the cable car for transport to Sentosa where you'll find amusement park activities, hotel, and casino. This is a getaway for Singapore."
,,First Cable Car Experience :),5.0,,We went to Merlion Park From Siloso Point(From Shangrila Sentosa ) and it was just one station but me and my husband had an great experience .
,,To have good view of Sentosa Island,5.0,,"We used this cable car during our Sentosa Island visit. It connects Sentosa from Harbour Front and within Sentosa it connects to beaches and adventure zone also.

As soon as you enter the cable , they ask to pose and click your pic. One you reach the Sentosa island, your pic is ready in frame, water frame and you are convinced to buy it."
,,A VIEW With Amazing Vistas and Surprising Sights,5.0,,WOW this was a morning treat that we shared with another couple. To our delight we were greeted with cool calm skies and a high rise view of the harbor and surrounding area. Sentosa Island was our destination and we spent the afternoon funning around young adults.
,,Fantastic view. Kids love it !,4.0,,We booked a return ticket through Cable car to Sentosa. The cab drops you at the departing point and the return trip is smooth as well. We bought a package from a company but still need to be in a queue.
,,Hard to locate,3.0,,Walked in circles trying to figure out where to board the cable car. On boarding the wind was stronger than usual and we ended up freaked out from the experience. One time is enough. Thanks.
,,Great Viewing,4.0,,Even if you are a little concerned about heights - this is definitely worth it. At first I was a bit anxious but you soon get used to it. It is very efficiently run - and provides quick and easy access to Sentosa. I was expecting it to be a longer ride but it was still worth it and I was surprised that it was not air conditioned. Windows provide ventilation but it got quite hot.
,,cable cars,3.0,,Ok.. experience.. you could take it or leave it..Lots of others things in Singapore that I felt were more worthwhile spending money on!
,,Cable car,5.0,,"Excellent experience, just a piece of advice, when using cable car do all the activities that come your way like Luge and mega adventure, beach, wings of time"
,,Nice and a bit scary,3.0,,Had a fabulous view of the sea. The ascension was a bit scary when the cable car started swaying a bit sidewards. It spiced the journey... Overall was nice.
,,Nice experience,4.0,,Not a long one like the cable car in langkawi. Still we can enjoy nice view and experience it if not done it before anywhere..
,,Not great at all,3.0,,"If you have been to cable car elsewhere around in your country or other places, just skip this expensive one. Not worth the money and time. Views are fine, not something worth memory."
,,Romantic Dinner for two,5.0,,We had a wonderful time doing 3 circuits and having a course each trip around. Was a great way to spend a romantic dinner. Food and wine was excellent and we had a great experience. Fully recommend it for other couples well worth it
,,Beautiful view from upside,5.0,,You.need to take to 15th floor first... and... enjoy...the view was amazing. And the train inside was very clean. It fells very safe inside with big anti sun glass. So you wont get hot inside. There were also an officer at avery station. It was beautiful.
,,Great experience!,5.0,,"We were ina a hotel in Sentosa and we decided to walk and take the cable car! It was nice, we did not wait for too Long and the views were impresive! Price is not cheap but if you go to Singapiore, I think it is worth it to take a ride in this one."
,,High Ride in the Sky,5.0,,"I took the MRT to Harbor Front to get to the cable car terminal. It was difficult to find the terminal because of the huge, multistory mall between the MRT and the cable car terminal. I had a voucher which had to be converted into a ticket which seemed complicated but was finally achieved. Once this was accomplished I was able to ride the whole line. It was a treat to be so high in the sky in a quiet, air conditioned, modern car. Much of Singapore could be viewed from the long ride.
You arrive to a T on the island and then the ticket is good for both ways and return. This is a worthwhile goodie to do on a clear day."
,,Good Experience - but expensive,4.0,,"Great fun (and thankfully our return journey was just before an epic storm), but very expensive at about £19pp return for a journey that is less than 10 mins each way. Very high off the sea/ground in parts so not for the faint-hearted. Got a free fridge magnet at the end so some sort of keepsake for the £19!"
,,up up we go!,5.0,,"My husband's first visit to a cable car - his words ""breath-taking!' We traveled from the Harbourfront station up to Mt Faber then onto from there to Sentosa Island. It was well worth the money and the pictures we got were fantastic! Highly recommend to anyone visiting Singapore!"
,,Fun and nice views!,5.0,,"Although a little pricey, like the rest of Singapore...it was something different to do. We went for a few hours, to check out the beach."
,,Good views.,4.0,,$29 Price is a bit exspensive but is for return trip if you want. We were told that a taxi would be difficult to get at the top of Mt Faber for return trip. Worth doing to go to Sentosa.
,,Fun and amazing view of the city,5.0,,"We took the cable car from the train station to go over the water to the island with aquarium. The cable car ended up being my favorite part of the day. You could see the whole city from Marina Sands on one side all the way across. Lots of fun, I highly recommend."
,,"Not bad, good views",3.0,,It’s a 30 minute round trip from Sentosa to Many thanks Faber which is the 2nd highest point on Singapore. Good views of the docks and shipping on the ride. Gets v busy at weekends
,,Beatutiful View,4.0,,The view from the cable car is quite beautiful. Its a good way to see the entire sentosa island from the top.
,,Very nice experience but too pricey,4.0,,"A great way to start and get Sentosa island. The view is very nice and it create enthusiasm prior reaching the pleasure island. However, the price for family is quite high"
,,great views,5.0,,the cable cars on Sentosa are a good way to see the island from above and if you are tired from walking a good way to site see and sit down. There are more than one so do them all
,,Fantastic views from the car,5.0,,"Take some time and visit Sentosa via the cable car ride. Once you pay, you can ride it as many times as you wish. Many things to see and do in Sentosa and stay for the light show, Should not miss it, it was fantastic. You can get local foor and American fast food and all kinds of Asian style food in the area. Close by is a casino, mall and Universal Studios park. You can spend on day or more in this area. Very scenic area and good eating places too. All from cheap eats to fine dining can be found here. Definately would recommend going here."
,,Fabulous Views of the Harbor,5.0,,"Great way to visit Santos Island with a unique overview of the harbor area, new housing and cruise ships."
,,it is good,3.0,,"there is nothing special , but city looks good an all clearv view can be observed, in day time its worth"
,,Nice View! Must Try!,5.0,,"I just take a half trip to mount fabre, it is quite high, but it is very safe, The cable car connects the Mainland with the Sentosa Island."
,,A great entry into Sentosa!,4.0,,"The kids marveled at this attraction. It was their first time on a cable car. The were very excited and a little scared, at least at first anyway. A great way for the kids to go to Sentosa island. A must say it is expensive though."
,,Almost fine dining,3.0,,We enjoyed our dining experience on the cable car however I will make a few comments it is not a 4 course dinner as 1st course is a shared bowl of nuts with champagne before hopping on and I don’t call that a course. I chose the fish it was delicious all 3 mouth fulls my dinner was such a small serving while my husband chose the steak which was also delicious and a very generous serving desert also delicious. When I think of a fine dining experience I think white table cloth maybe a flower on the table not a plastic tray. Having paid $374( as we had a glass of wine extra) I was left disappointed and very hungry
,,Entry to Sentosa ..,5.0,,"This takes you from the MRT station to the Sentosa Island ... The view is good .. There are other ways to reach the sentosa island like the train , you can walk and even the bus .. Not much to write about except for a cable car experience and the view ..."
,,Viewing Singapore from a Height !!,5.0,,"The cable car connects the Mainland with the Sentosa Island. Runs like clock-work, travels across the water from where one gets a super view of Singapore and whets your appetite for what will follow on Sentosa."
,,took it first time,3.0,,"and have to say. Can do, but mustn't Nothing special. Ok, the view is not bad, but that's it. Start and End of the Cable Car is not easy to reach. Only Taxi or by walk."
,,Nice Scenic City Views To Be Had,4.0,,"Took the cable car from Mount Faber Park to Sentosa Island. The lines are long for the ride due to round trip riders. But once you get on, the scenic views are spectacular. Another attraction in Singapore providing great experience to see Its cleanliness and beauty."
,,Cbble car links Sentosa Island to the mainland,4.0,,"We went to Sentosa for the day. On the way there, we took the MRT and walked across the bridge. At night, we decided to try the cable car. We left from the island and took it across the water to the station near the mall. We then walked through the mall to the MRT. It was a nice ride and had very good views of the surrounding area."
,,Good views from harbourfront to sentosa,4.0,,Arrived on mrt at harbourfront. Cable car was not well sign posted but eventually found our way to cable car station in separate building to vivo shopping centre. Redeemed our sia card for tickets which was easy. Views from harbourfront to sentosa was very good.
,,Spectacular views over Sentosa and Singapore,5.0,,"Crossed over to Sentosa by cable car, great fun, spectacular views. Would recommend even if you're afraid of heights although there is a monorail near the cable car centre to get you over to Sentosa"
,,Singapore Cable Car,5.0,,"I visited singapore in september 2017 and took a cable car ride.This is an excellent ride and must do in singapore.I booked ticket through Klook which gave 40% discount.Other online sites also give good discount,so it will be economical to buy ticket online. You can board from top that is mount Faber or harbour front near vivo city mall .If you board from harbour front then you should go to mount Faber station and get down and take photos etc. and then again board the cable car which will take you to Sentosa island.You will get excellent view from mount Faber to Sentosa island.It is a must do in singapore but remember to take full ride from mount Faber to Sentosa instrad of harbour front to Sentosa."
,,A relaxing way to reach Sentosa,4.0,,"A bit pricey, but worth the journey to see the harbour. The staff are quite pleasant and the cars themselves are very comfortable. It wasn't busy so we had the car pretty much to ourselves."
,,Super Connectivity,5.0,,You will just love the experience though it might be just another cable car. The management and the feel is awesome
,,Lovely Views!,4.0,,"My fiancee and I spent the weekend in Singapore in October. She wanted to see a new country, and I wanted to take her to a romantic location to propose. :) When she first saw the Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa line) running near the Hard Rock Hotel on Sentosa Island, her eyes flew open wide and she said, ""WE HAVE TO RIDE THAT!!!"" I was happy to oblige and eager to ride it myself.

The Singapore Cable Car has 2 lines, the Sentosa line that takes you along Sentosa Island and connects you to the second line, the Mount Faber line, which takes you off the island and to the top of Mount Faber. There are several stations per line that allow you to disembark or to connect to the other line. We used our round-trip ticket to get us off Sentosa (where we caught a taxi and went downtown), and later to return us to Sentosa at sunset.

The view is spectacular...ESPECIALLY at sunset!!!

Prices weren't cheap, but they weren't that expensive either. Depending on the time of day that you ride, you may get lucky and get your own car, but be prepared to share it with other groups...a ticket on the Singapore Cable Car doesn't guarantee you your own car. Each car holds 8-10 people, depending on how full they want to fill it. Cars move at a brisk pace and can sway a little if you move around or the winds are blowing. Those who have a fear of heights may want to pass on this experience.

We took many memorable pictures and had a wonderful time cuddling in our car at sunset as we returned to the Sentosa line from Mount Faber, and later as we rode the entire Sentosa line after dark to take us back to the beginning of the Sentosa line near the Sentosa Merlion. We do not regret riding and would gladly go again if we ever find ourselves in Singapore once more. Our only gripe is that we wish it would have been longer. I realize that building something of that scale is absurdly expensive, but we wished there had been a 3rd line to take us deeper into the city.

Ride away and enjoy the views!"
,,Awesome Views,4.0,,What a great way to get over to Sentosa Island. You have great views of the harbour. Awesome way to get some great holiday photos. I would definitely recommend to family and friends.
,,Thoroughly enjoyable,5.0,,A must do. Great way to get to Sentosa and travel up to the historic Fabre Hill. Comfortable cars and one hell of a view
,,Good Experience,4.0,,If you are in Singapore then it is an must experience place to visit. One time experience should be taken.
,,On the way to Sentosa,5.0,,CAble car is one of the way to travel to Sentosa island from mainland Singapore (most expensive way also). Easier way is by Sentosa Express. Both (and even walk way) leave from Vivo City mall only.
,,Great Cable Car,5.0,,"This is to be the only cable car traveling above a forest, town, harbor, beach and water. The line connected from Fiber Tower and Senthosa. Also island private line. Amazing experience."
,,Perfect views,5.0,,"Another must in Singapore is the cable car ride. The view is like no other, and it allows you to appreciate this splendid city. There are three routes, and I encourage you to take all of them!"
,,Great Views,5.0,,Great way to get to sentosa and see singapore from a height. takes about 15mins from Harbour front to sentosa
,,Views,5.0,,Great views and nice way to spend the afternoon. Don’t be shy to go walking and seeing where you end up...
,,Exciting,3.0,,The cable car from mainland to sentosa island is an exciting prospect and affordable. Worth going once..
,,Long Weekend in Singapore,5.0,,"Great views and a few stops along the way. Enjoyable attraction, very quiet and relaxing. We were lucky to get our own cable car."
,,Fun and exhilarating,5.0,,Just for the sheer fun of it ride the cable cars. Brilliant views and lots of attractions on Sentosa Island for children.
,,Awesome view,5.0,,"We went to Sentosa in this and the view was simply amazing, over the sea and forest, it’s a great way to reach Sentosa.
No specific tips for this, just check if you wanna go for a round trip or one way and the station up to which you wanna go to.
However getting around in Sentosa is kinda easy as the MRT station is pretty much everywhere and it’s also free!"
,,Nice,4.0,,There are two cable cars: one from Singapore to Sentosa and other within Sentosa. Both give a good view of Singapore and Sentosa respectively.
,,Cable Car View,5.0,,The view over the water was amazing to Sentosa Island from Mount Faber. If you love cable cars and a fun destination this is a must do in Singapore.
,,"Good way to explore sentosa for tourist, for frequent user (e.g., more than 3x a year), consider Faber license",4.0,,"Cable car ride from Harbor front -> Mount Faber -> Harbor front -> Sentosa isle then followed by Imbiah station -> Merlion station -> Imbiah station -> Beach station -> Imbiah station.

REMEMBER: if you like me and plan to visit and go around Sentosa or even universal studio for more than 3 times a year, then better get the FABER LICENSE pass -> allows you for unlimited use of the cable car AND the sentosa express train for 1 year (i got the family deal which allows me to give 4 people the license). It was 139 SGD for the whole family (110 SGD if renewal from Islander card)

I like to bring friends or family or relatives to cable car trip in Sentosa so, this card is no brainer. I can get discount when buying ticket for them too (50% sky pass ticket)

Within the 3rd visit to the isle using cable cars you have earned back your investment already compared to others who use single day pass or 1 trip pass etc.

Like best: ease of use for traveling in Sentosa, beautiful view. Safe for children and not scary since it is encapsuled.

Bring camera, selfie stick.
Sit in balanced manner (e.g., not all passengers in one side)
Come when it is not busy day/time so you can have the whole carriage for yourself. (in peak time you have to share with other ppl although you can try to request)."
,,Best to go in the evenings,4.0,,"The view is great but I somehow prefer the Singapore Flyer where you can view Batam on clear nights. They now have a promotion for unlimited rides and once is enough for me, although my relatives from overseas went twice. That left me to take a look around the place and found out that the prices of eateries and souvenirs there were on the high side, save for the kiosk for soft drinks and ice cream across the road. Drove my relatives to Smith Street in Chinatown for dinner."
,,Fun and exciting ride!,4.0,,"I have tried different cable cars from other country as well. I took this a part of the itinerary due to family members first time experience. The ride still brings fun and thrill to me so i suggest make this part of your tour as well.we take the sky pass back-and -forth ticket which is just enough i guess to visit anywhere in Sentosa and in Faber mountain. This is about 5-10 dollar cheaper than unlimited ride. Honestly, we did not take cable car from Merlion Station back to Imbiah look out since it is just literally few steps away :). So the Skypass round trip tickets is just right to fit our need."
,,Diwali visit,4.0,,"nice experience, but nothing exceptional. You have many such cable car rides in India too. Very costly too."
,,Only Round Trip Ticket is Available,3.0,,"The ticket for cable car is S$29, and it is a round trip deal. If one only wants to go to Sentosa on the cable car but walk back to mainland, the return ticket will be wasted. Only round ticket ticket is available. Inland ticket covering just the Sentosa portion costs S$13, which I didn’t think it’s worth it. The island isn’t big; one can easily cover it all on foot.

Overall, I don’t find the cable car worth the price."
,,Bird Eye View of Singapore,5.0,,An accelerating experience. Here you get a bird's eye view of Singapore. We took one way cable car from Singapore to Sentosa Island. They also offer good offers clubbed with cable car of Sentosa attractions. Must use this mode for a great experience and seeing Singapore from a different perspective. Must visit.
,,One of the BEST,5.0,,"AWESOME. AWESOME. AWESOME trip from Mt. Faber to Sentosa Island and return.

The view(s) are breathtaking and take you to heights well above the general area.

Visibility for miles in all directions will leave you with your lower jaw dropped for hours of time.

Try to secure a cable car with loads of plastic flowers decorated inside .... Apparently they are primarily used for weddings!

Way to go Mt. Faber."
,,Gliding through the air,4.0,,"We done all lines and stations, hopping on and off and making the most of a lovely DRY day. We booked this on line and got a discount and saved time rather than queuing for our tickets. The attendants were all quite pleasant and as there was a cruise ship in port it was lovely gliding over the top of this. We certainly got our monies worth. In between stations we hopped on the transit (FREE) down to Sentosa, so we could get the cable car back.
The best bit was , as it was not overly busy we had the cable car to ourselves, so you can stand where you like to get photos.
Its surprising what you can see from the air, a lot more than you could possibly see from the ground. We glided over the water park and it looked absolutely great, I would have loved to go back with my grandchildren."
,,Neat and clean,4.0,,This gives an aerial and panoramic view of Santosa Island.. cable cars are very neat and newly made. Staff was good too..it makes us see forest to harbor to island. Very small kids would not love it very much but adults would really like it..
,,Mesmerizing View,4.0,,"Hop on this to get an excellent view of Singapore, especially the Sentosa Islands. There are a few stations in between. If possible take the cable car from the first station to the last station. It is just worth it. It is a very different and mesmerizing way to see Singapore in the evening specially."
,,Good city sights - not suited if you are scared of heights,3.0,,"Thought very overpriced for what it was. We only wanted to go to Vivo city t than catch train but the ticket price was to Sentosa Island. Would definely recommend the restuarant at Mt Faber - Faber Bistro. Cocktails pretty good too. The walk around for the
""""bell of happiness"" is a good photo opportunity as well."
,,Excellent experience,5.0,,There are two lines each having three stations. You can hop into through any of the stations. You can also take one line only instead of two. I will recommend you to take both lines. It will take much time and worth taking it. You can drop by in each station and again embark to the same station. I will recommend you to access this place from HarbourFront MRT.
,,Fantastic view,5.0,,There were 5 of us and we had a cabin to ourselves it was a fantastic view with ships coming in the berth tankers cranes working on wharfs the scenic view you could not bet . We went over to Sentosa island and you could see all the hotels pools etc
,,Different view of Singapore,4.0,,Singapore Cable Car from Faber Peak is a different way to see Singapore do go in the evening to enjoy the sunset
,,nice view,3.0,,"Bring my kids here by Nov 2016. The view from Mt. Faber was great. But other than that, there is nothing much to do here."
,,Don't do it!!!,1.0,,"Two years ago I hiked the Southern Ridges trail from the Harbour Front MRT. This time I brought 4 friends. One suggested we take the cable car to the top of Mt. Faber and hike down.
The cable car ride costs $29 each. $145 for 5 of us. As soon as the car leaves the station you can see your destination and people exiting cable cars at the other station maybe 1,000 feet ahead (just an estimate). We all started laughing. That's it? $29?
What a rip off. You can walk to the top of Mt. Faber in short order from Harbour Front MRT or just take a taxi/Uber there. While I'm at it ... Mt. Faber is a hill not a mountain.
The Southern Ridges hike was excellent."
,,Day pass only covers one boarding per station,4.0,,"The cable car was a great way to see Mount Faber and Sentosa. Be warned that the day pass only covers one boarding per station, even if you do loop and do not exit at a station, they still mark you as boarding."
,,"great views of sentosa and the bay,",4.0,,"this was our transport to the sea aquarium at sentosa island, you get an extended trip and wonderful views of the singapore night sky and sentosa island"

,,This is worth a visit -Really,5.0,,This was one of the highlights of a visit to Singapore well run small Q and the views were truly amazing-y have to go on the second ride to the beach a really lovely beach in SINGAPORE with a first class hotel
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This is a must if you are in Singapore, you get a totally different view of the city and it is a worthwhile experience and different way to travel to Sentosa"
,,To visit Sentosa,5.0,,The cable car starts from a place called the Mount Faber to the Sentosa Island.. the ride is great and the service is cool... it is expensive.. costs around 20 SGD for unlimited day ride.. but worth one ride
,,Wow so Thrilling!!,5.0,,"This was an experience of a lifetime.
A view of the entire city from such a height, really thrilling.
The best part was the take-off and landings and the passing the pillars was very smooth. Hardly felt nervous, which I have in many a cable car rides :P"
,,Cable Car a Must,5.0,,I dont like heights but i must say this is definitely a must to do. The cage is very safe and the ride across was very smooth. I only went on this as my friend really wanted to do this so i didn't want to be a spoil spoilt but i am so glad i did. You see a different view of Singapore plus there was a cruise ship in the harbour and we went over the top of it which was pretty exciting.
,,Good value,5.0,,Spent half a day exploring Sentosa plus both cable car rides available. You can hop on hop off at the various stations allowing you to see the numerous attraction on offer. You can even dine onboard in the evening.
,,Go for the views.,5.0,,"Go to the top of the hill on Singapore island. Take a camera, enjoy the views and the awesome technology and engineering.

The cable cars have recently been upgraded.

Get off at Sentosa Island and catch the monorail back (free)

This connects to the MTR or taxis.

Fantastic time to stop and enjoy, some family or friends time."
,,Excellent and thrilling ride with a bird's eye view,5.0,,"If you are going to Sentosa consider taking the cable car from HarborFront or Mt. Faber. This, according to me is the coolest and the most exciting way to reach Resorts World, Sentosa. You get a bird's eye view of Singapore and the view is amazing to say the least."
,,Nice View,3.0,,Its good for time pass. You will get special discount if you travel after 6 pm. Its the perfect time as you can see both day and night view.
,,Best way of seeing the city,5.0,,This was a most memorable experience soaring above the skyline in the cable car gondolas from Mount Faber over to Santosa island. Don’t miss it!
,,Cable car rides.,5.0,,We used the cable cars all day. We went to Sentosa beach and back up towards Changi. Great views of this amazing city.
,,stupid thing to spend money,3.0,,"I find its stupid to spend money on this, Its better you take mono rail from Vivo city mall and reach to you desired location at santosa. Cable car did not add fun to my experience."
,,Must do in Singapore,5.0,,"Went on this at closing time and loved it. Pods are air conditioned and comfortable, would recommend to anyone visiting Singapore."
,,To sentosa,5.0,,Well connected would be the buzz word for Singapore. From metro station to sentosa island the cable car gave a majestic view of the entire island and beautiful horizon
,,Visit to Sentosa,3.0,,"The cable car ride to the island of Sentosa was an excellent experience. The cars were clean and tidy and staff were very friendly and helpful and were always seemed to be enjoying their work. You can also catch the mono- rail to the island but the aerial views over the island are, well, not the best pictures you can take from a cable car because of all the shipping waiting to dock in Singapore Harbour, but you can get some shots. A great ride. Been there done that. 5/10."
,,An amazing way to see Singapore,5.0,,"We did this twice, once in the day and once at sunset, because we enjoyed it so much. You can get a fantastic view of the city and Sentosa. Greta for children."
,,Evening Joy Ride,5.0,,We took an evening return trip from Merlion station. Jumped off briefly for a beach stroll and ice cream at Fort Siloso - super relaxing! Inexpensive and a great way to see the lights of the island.
,,Very Enjoyable,4.0,,We used this to go to the island and enjoyed the ride! The facility feels safe and the views are exceptional of the city.
,,Great views,4.0,,"We purchased the full ticket and went first to Mount Faber and then on to Sentosa. From there we used the other cable car to explore Sentosa Island, it's a great way to get a birds eye view of the island and surrounding Singapore."
,,Cable car to the top,5.0,,"Tickets were purchased on line. ( so we didn't have to join the very long queues to buy tickets on the day, especially as most people were taking the CC straight to Sentosa). We bought a round trip from Singapore/ Mt Faber/ Sentosa/Singapore.
Awesome views on the way up to Mt Fabre. Took time out at the top in a cafe called Spuds and Aprons and enjoyed magnificent views from an edge seat. Took the CC down, and just stayed on the car as it went back down through Singapore, on its way to Sentosa. A great way to get a birds eye perspective of Singapore."
,,"Great views, normal Cable Car",4.0,,"Coming from Switzerland, where every infant has used a Cable Car, the ride itself was nothing spectacular. I understand that it might be something special in a city which does not feature any real mountains. However the cable car itself was not something spectacular to me.

What however was sensational, were the views that can be experienced on the way to Santosa Island. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing such a fantastic city from a completely new perspective. The ability to see over the bay and the island once arriving there was for sure a highlight.

I would for sure recommend this way of transporting to anyone wanting to visit Santosa Island. The views are definitely worth it."
,,Spectacular View Of The City,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore for a trip, do visit this. A slow moving cabl car gives you a superb view of Sentosa island & the view of the docks behind."
,,Don’t forget to explore Mount Faber,4.0,,"Before I got to SG I knew I wanted to do the cable car ride but I didn’t know where it went from/to. Although I’d made no plans to go to Sentosa Island, when I found out that’s where the cable car stops, I thought I may as well explore the island a bit.

The cable car is definitely worth doing. It’s a nice little trip and you get to see some good sights. It’s obviously a bonus if you’re on there around sunset time.

There’s a number of different ticket options which you can combine with attractions at Sentosa to make the package price a bit cheaper. There’s also a cable car on Sentosa Island, so you can even buy a ticket where you can have unlimited rides on both cable cars. I opted for just the Mount Faber cable car return ticket which was $29 / £16.

Be sure to walk around Mount Faber before or after you get the cable car. It’s a nice little walk with good photo opportunities. There’s the highest point, some colourful steps and the bell of happiness."
,,Spiders in the air,5.0,,A gentle ride in the sky with panaorasmic views of Singapore and Sentosa Island. The start of the ride was made exciting by the sudden appearance of a large spider that dropped onto my daughter's shoulder. Good fun and worth the trip.
,,Shortened ride?,4.0,,"I think one line is temporarily closed, so the ride is only 20 min right now. A nice, quiet scenic ride."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,We got the cable car across and just took taxi back in the evening after a fantastic day on Sentosa! If your going to Singapore make sure you have at least 1 day visiting Sentosa
,,View from above,4.0,,Great way to get from Singapore to the resort island. See from a different prospective. Enjoyable for all ages.
,,Incredible view of the city,5.0,,"This was the best tour that I've ever done in my live. So much to see, so many places to take pictures."
,,Great views,5.0,,A fantastic way to get to Sentosa. Amazing views from the cable car. Pre-book your tickets or get there early to avoid the queues.
,,Great Views,4.0,,"We rode this attraction last week. What a fantastic experience with views of Sentosa Island activities and the city skyline.

The entire ride consists of two lines; the Mount Faber Line from the mainland ($29 include Sentosa entry) and the Sentosa Line ($13) or for both lines ($33). Rather than purchase a specific ticket for this ride we purchased the 'Singapore Pass’ that allowed us one 'free' complete circuit each. We rode all sections from the Island back to the main land.

Every cable car offers different views of Singapore and it’s many attractions. The ride provides a great view of the zip line, beach areas, Adventure Cove Water Park and Universal Studio. The cable car ride is smooth and quite long.

For two segments of our ride the three of us had the car to ourselves (they seat 8) but for the final segment when there was a long line on the mainland to return to the island we had to share."
,,Room for improvement,3.0,,We did the ' fine' dining experience in the cable car ride last night and were very disappointed with the soup and main course of grilled Angus beef. We have never known Angus beef to have so much fat. There was hardly any potatoes or vegetables either. The rest of the meal wasn't too bad. A shame the soup and the main course spoiled the dining experience. The price was far too dear for the experience.
,,Easy way to go from mainland Singapore to Sentosa island,5.0,,"Great way to travel. Very modern gondolas, with great views of Sentosa Island, Mount Faber and Singapore. Best if you purchase a one-day ticket with unlimited rides."
,,Great ride across to Sentosa Is.,5.0,,"Magnificent views. Safe, clean and easy ride to Sentosa Is. Too quick if anything. So much to look at."
,,Best wiev,5.0,,Singapore is very nice. View the city the bay and the see from the sky is better. Better the cable car than the panoramic wheel
,,Must do When in Singapore,5.0,,"What a fantastic experience with views to die for. Used 3 different cable cars to get to where I needed to go, and back,on Sentosa Island. Every cable car offers different views of Singapore and it’s many attractions. 99% of the time you can secure a cable car of your own or with the party you are with. The staff are absolutely fantastic and helped me beyond their duties after I suffered a fall. They are a true credit to Singapore Cable Cars."
,,Smooth ride to sentosa,5.0,,The cable car ride is smooth and quite long. You feel the delight of being so high and watch the beautiful sentosa with its water park from the above.
,,Nice view to the city,5.0,,"We decided to take the cable car instead of the train to Sentosa, we liked it so much. We saw few cars has a table in the middle and a couple was having a romantic dinner inside - could be a good surprise for the next time :)"
,,Friends of 7,3.0,,It's just a normal ride you take from point A to point B but it comes with great view of the Sentosa and Harbourfront. I wouldnt tell you to expect a lot but it is a memorable ride.
,,Flying High,4.0,,We took the canle car back from sentosa island to the Singapore city. The ease of access is great the journey and the views were magnificent. It was dissappointing that you had to purchase a returnticket when we only wanted totravelthe one way having said this it was still a great experienmce which is well worth doing.
,,Great views,5.0,,"This was our favourite thing at Sentosa. We did both cable cars and the views were amazing, plus looking down in the attractions was really cool. Great view of the zip line and beach area. The Faber line cars are quite hot and need more windows or fans."
,,Great view from the sky,5.0,,"We bought the cable car tickets online to save time queuing up at ticket office, however, still had to line up to collect paper ticket!
Then we were on our way.
Entered the cable car at Harbour Front and travelled between Mt Faber and Sentosa Island.
We didn't go on any of the attractions on Sentosa Island instead choosing to go the beach areas to swim. However the beaches are very dirty with a lot of rubbish on the sand and in the water. This was very surprising to us as Singapore is a very clean place but Sentosa is not. They need to clean the sand daily to stop the rubbish from ending up in the waters.
I'd recommend the Cable Car for the experience and views but Sentosa didn't have anything to offer."
,,Fabulous views,5.0,,"I am a fraidy cat so hung on tight for this one as I'm scared of heights, but it is a very safe option to get to Sentosa Island."
,,Great views,5.0,,A scenic way to reach Sentosa and experience great views and an alternative perspective on Singapore.
,,Very good experience,5.0,,"We wanted to visit Sentosa Island, and were very glad we paid to get a taxi to Mount Faber and the cable car over to the island from there. Magnificent view, clean cars and smooth ride - there and back!"
,,GV Pillai,5.0,,A Great experience to ride on all stations from Mount Fabre to Sentosa Island. After reaching Sentosa we shifted to another cable car to ride inside the Island.
,,City view with Cable car,4.0,,"You can view city from Cable car, its nice experience if you have never take such cable car earlier. While travelling to Santosa , you can take this cable car and see top view of santosa and city around. Good Experience."
,,Bird's eye view,5.0,,"It was very busy when we caught the cable car, but the views made up for it. We decided to pay to do the full ride, from Sentosa Island and back. We had been advised to depart on the 'mainland' side to allow for easier access back to our hotel."
,,Views galore,5.0,,Return trip from Mt Faber to Sentosa Island was a nice experience with great views. It was not busy so we had a car to ourselves -worth visiting for a different way to get to Sentosa
,,The view from the top is spectacular!,5.0,,"Amazing experience,takes half an hour to complete a whole round.Not shaky,very strong and sturdy seats and cable car per se."
,,Too pricey,3.0,,Get some good views and makes travelling to and from Sentosa easy. Can be a bit pricey though. We got a day pass but did not really need it as a one way journey on both the lines is ample to cover all grounds - unless you are staying on the Island and plan to go to mainland and come back. Then its worth it.
,,"Quiet, efficient, quick means of getting to Sentosa Island.",5.0,,"This cable car goes to Sentosa island. It is quiet, efficient and safe. Cost was $28 with seniors allowance. A very enjoyable ride with superb views over and back."
,,Good Views,4.0,,The views are great but if you have a fear of heights do not go on it. The ride was smooth and enjoyable and a great place to take photos.
,,Great views,5.0,,This is a must see for Singapore/Sentosa. You get to travel high above the city but it is very quite and peaceful if you can get your own cabin. Pretty quiet at this time of year.
,,Amazing View! Love the Scenery!,5.0,,"Bought the season pass which is way more value for buying a single ticket but it's only for locals. Sat many times and I got much more than I paid for. Recommended for local couples to get the reasonable priced season pass. Got discounts on other activities and restaurants in Sentosa as well. Single ticket is rather expensive but if you are visiting, it maybe worth the fee."
,,Nice,4.0,,The cable car ride was one of the highlights of Singapore. It gives you a Panasonic view f the city and takes you to Santosa for a fun filled adventure. Good to go early morning so you have enough time for all the attractions
,,Good way to see Mt.Faber,5.0,,"Took the cable car from Harbourfront to Mt.Faber and return, it was not busy so able to get a car on our own. Good viewing of the harbour and surrounds, Sentosa and Mt.Faber."
,,Great views but be careful,3.0,,"The trip over gives you some really great views but.... if you intend to purchase one of the packages that allow you to go to attractions, be VERY CAREFUL as some of the major one's are NOT included and despite what they tell you, you won't now positively till you front up."
,,The sky is the limit,5.0,,A very worthwhile activity as it give you an experience to see the very newest side of Singapore. Universal themed park with the underwater experience a definite plus
,,"Awesome, comfortable trip",5.0,,We found some discount tickets online which include both Sentosa and Harborfront line so was able to go in all cable car rides. This is a very nice trip. Have some amazing views here and there. You can combine it with a visit to Universal Studio or some attraction in Sentosa as going from cable car faster than waiting for the train.
,,Fantastic,4.0,,This is well worth doing if you are venturing to Sentosa Island...our daughter thought it was amazing.
,,A fun journey to Sentosa,4.0,,"As with everything in SP the cable car was easy to find from Harbour Front MPT, efficient, safe, clean and good value for money. We tagged on a few attractions on Sentosa to our ticket but the day pass by itself allowing you unlimited rides on both lines of the cable car is good value."
,,Amazing views of Singapore!,5.0,,"Definetely worth doing this! We got a taxi up to Mount Faber & rode all the way along to Sentosa at Sunset, Amazing panoramic views of the city in all directions, as well as the ships out at sea! We did however, have a hitchiker in the form of a huge flying beetle which made part of the experience a little freaky! Would recommend closing the windows! Such a cool thing to do though!"
,,Wood service,5.0,,Very good service. Clean and comfortable cabins. The stuff allowed us to have our own cabin although we were three. Stunning view to the forest. You feel safe inside. Amazing that there is a building in the route and the cabins pass through the building to reach the island!!!
,,Cable Car Sky Dining,5.0,,"My Husband and I enjoyed the experience of dining in the Cable Car, it was so much fun, we did the circuit from Mt Faber to Sentosa Island twice, the meal was a Bento Set menu, very nice.
Some thing different that we had never done before."
,,Fun,5.0,,Such a fun way to get across to Sentosa worth the trip up and the money. Very friendly staff as well.
,,Nice ride,4.0,,"Took the cable car ride to Sentosa but if you have the iVenture card then you cannot take it from Mount Faber, so instead we rode it back from Sentosa to Mt. Faber and it was great. Overall not a very long journey but very nice views. However there are limited transportation options from Mt. Faber and it is a bit tricky to get a cab so public transport might be the only option."
,,Fantastic views of Singapore and Sentosa,5.0,,"Great views and photo ops on the way across to Sentosa Is. Did this as part of the 1/2 day Sentosa tour, would thoroughly recommend."
,,Save your money,3.0,,The cable car departs from Mount Faber which doesn't have good transit links or taxi's that frequent. It costs $29 to ride round trip as they don't offer one way fares. For $31 you can ride the cable car to the island then once on the island you can ride the other one. We randomly grabbed a map that offered a $3 discount on the dual cable car so both that. When we asked if there were taxi's that could pick us up from Mount Faber they told us to get off at Vivo city mall. There weren't many people there that day so we had the cable car to ourselves. It's a nice ride with a great view. Once on the island we decided to go exploring before getting on the other cable car. We went to both beaches and when we tried to find where to pick up the other cable car as we were tired it was nowhere close to where we were. We finally just jumped on the free tram that went from the island to Vivo city. Save your money for buying a drink at the top of Marina Bay Sands!!
,,Excellent!,5.0,,Great Value for money!! Would highly recommend. Was a great way to get around Sentosa and the views were spectacular!
,,cable car,4.0,,cable car to sentosa is superb and nice. beautiful view and a different exprience. sentosa view from cable car is breathtaking.

,,Amazing view,5.0,,"Just go, a must do when you are in singapore. It gives you the view of the sea and mountain plus it will connect to sentosa park. We enjoy it even we have fight with my friend when we are taking this as he was a bit scared of height."
,,Renovated cable car,5.0,,Lovely cars which had been renovated since we last visited and now hold up to 8 people. Despite the height we felt very safe.
,,Great way to get to/from Sentosa,5.0,,"It's not a particularly cheap experience, however, our kids loved the ride. It 'flies' over the sea, through a building and above Sentosa's leisure attractions. Great views and the carts are clean and safe."
,,Picturesque Views of the City.,5.0,,I traveled in the Sentosa Line which was only 13 dollars for the round trip. I got to see some beautiful sights of Sentosa and the city on one side and the ships coming into the harbour on the other side. The Cars have darkened windows so the sun doesn't bother you too much. When i went the cable cars weren't too busy so we had a whole car just for us. We went just after a bit of rain so the rain drops on the windows ruined our photos a little but the experience was memorable.
,,Singapore Cable Car,5.0,,"this part in Singapore Must be seen, where you can see Sentosa Island from the top and the water park"
,,Short ride,3.0,,The cable car ride is for very short time. U pay a handsome amount for 15 mins max. Its too much. Others got in inside ur car. You have to share with others.

,,A trip you should take,5.0,,"This ride gives you spectacular views of the port area and city on the way over or back to Sentosa Island, a second Cable car once on the island takes you in another direction, well worth a trip."
,,Great Cable Car,5.0,,It's One Of The Best Cable Carel Situated At Mount Faber Which Takes You To Sentosa Island Which Is One Of The Best Island Of Tbe World The View From.The Cable Car Is Excellent Though The Ride Does Not Take Place In Monaoon Month Excellent Cable Car

,,The kids love it!,5.0,,"We took the cable car from Sentosa to Mount Faber and back, and then changed to the other line. From Imbiah, we sent to the Merlion park then down to Siloso point. The cable car within Sentosa is just so-so. What the kids loved is the trip up to Mount Faber."
,,Worth it when going to Sentosa Island,5.0,,We took the cable car to get to and back from Sentosa Island. Easy to find look for Tower 2 at Harbour Side if being dropped off by cab. Great views during the day crossing over. We got the ticket that allowed us to also use the Sentosa Island internal Cable cars which was great to see the island in easy. Very clean and if going as a couple normally you get your own car or as a group up to 8 people. We took the car back in the evening and the sky line was totally different and worth it.

,,Must for first timers.....though pricey!,5.0,,"The cable car journey provides some amazing views of the harbour and Sentosa island. We went in the evening taking day time views as well as night time.....different experience altogether!

You can buy tickets at the Harbourfront station as well as buy tickets in conjunction with a number of attractions to tailor to your needs. We bought ticket at SGD 52 which included unlimited rides in the cable cars (both the two services) and free entry to the show 'Wings to Time'. The surprise package was food at 'Old days and Food'

We not only loved the rides in the car crossing the harbor a number of times absorbing the beauty as many times as could be possible. Were stunned with the orderly planned infrastructure and the upkeep."
,,Nice view of bay and Sentosa.,4.0,,"Aerial view of sentosa gives you an idea of how meticulously planned the whole Island is, there is not an inch of space un-utilized or under-utilised. The water treatment plant and water theme park and what not, you can see it all in this ride.."
,,Ride the cable car,5.0,,"Views are fantastic across the famous Singapore harbour, one of the World's busiest. You get to see the tourists resort island of Sentosa / 'Peace' where many attractions are sited. Cable cars travel from Mount Faber across to and fro to Sentosa and back ."
,,rubbish,2.0,,considering the cost .. its only a 2-3 min ride . most of the things in singapore are hyped .. actually very very hyped. be carefull. if u can take advice from those who have already travelled but dont boast about them travelling to Singapore.
,,50th birthday celebration,5.0,,"What a fantastic experience. Excellent Food, Wonderful views and staff were so friendly and helpful. Will remember this forever. Exceeded our expectations"
,,Great views and a great way to get around,5.0,,If you are headed to Sentosa island this is a great and easy way to get across. If you are lucky you might get a deck view of one of the docked cruise ships too.
,,Go cable car!,5.0,,"Quite pricey compared to just taking the Sentosa Express, but hey, if it's your first cable car ride then you've got to go for it! It's a smooth ride, unless you're afraid of heights... Enjoy the sight from up there."
,,Great way to get to Sentosa,5.0,,"We took the cable car ride to get to Sentosa and its many attractions. There are further cable car rides available on Sentosa itself. A great way to travel, with panoramic views of the area. Seeing Universal Studios from the air was a treat. Very comfortable and spacious cars."
,,Worth doing at least once,4.0,,"The cable car journey provides some amazing views of Sentosa. Stops include the Merlion, Siloso Point and Mount Faber.

You can buy tickets at the Harbourfront station as well as buy tickets in conjunction with a number of attractions to tailor to your needs. The tickets for the Mount Faber Line + Sentosa cost S$33 for an adult and S$22. Tickets for an unlimited pass on the cable, S.E.A Aquarium and Universal Studios cost S$122 for an adult and S$90 for a child.

With these tickets you can hop on and off without the hassle of buying new tickets. Once you leave the station many of the attractions such as the MegaZip, Skyline Luge and Madam Tussauds are nearby. It is worth doing once just to admire the view."
,,Nice views from Cable Car,5.0,,"The cable car can be used to go from main land to Sentosa where there are lots of attractions. In our case, we took return ticket, so that we can return to the mainland after visiting sentosa attractions. The ride itself is short but views from it are terrific. It goes to sentosa station from where one can visit madamme tussads, or take other mode of transportation to visit other attractions"
,,Excellent.,5.0,,"We planned to take the cable car to reach the Sentosa island. It was wonderful trip. We took the cable car and reach the Sentosa and from their took the mono rail. Because of this we could see many places in between, which wouldn't have been possible in cab."
,,Oh i love it so much,5.0,,"Truly one of the best , I love the view specially at sunset , staff very helpful and always smile , I purchased season card and all I can say, worth every penny ."
,,GREAT VIEWS OF SENTOSA,4.0,,"The cable car ride from Mt Faber to Sentosa Island was one part of an afternoon/evening tour....though there are a number of sightseeing passes available that include the cable car and you could certainly manage to visit this place on your own rather than do it as a tour.
The cable cars are surprisingly large, very steady and have huge windows to allow for great photo opportunities and unimpeded views of the island and it's surrounds. The trip takes 15-20 minutes or so and stops once midway for the mandatory souvenir photo to be taken by the on-site photographer....printed up at lightning speed and available at the end of the ride! Definitely a must do in Singapore!"
,,Lovely View,4.0,,"The Cable Car is very smooth no bumps, its also very clean glass is spotless. Well worth the trip lovely views."
,,Great way to go to sentosa,5.0,,I personally recommend to buy both sentosa amd mount faber line altogether. It is really convenient to hop on and off cable car whenever I needed. The view from the cable car is great both day and night. Go to harbourfront mrt station and you will find a sign that says 'cable car' and you can easily find the ticket office. A lot of combo options are available too. Credit card payment is accpetable.
,,Great Experience,5.0,,If you do one thing whilst in Singapore spend the money and get the cable cart to Sentosa from Mount Faber Peak. It was a wonderful experience viewing the bay from that height. My daughter loved it.
,,Trip to Sentosa,4.0,,"It is highly recommended that you take Cable car while going to Sentosa as you get a beautiful view of the island and the bay. It also gives you good view of the city. There are multiple platforms from where you can board, Faber mountain being one of them which is very close to city center. It is advisable to prebook this ride in advance and online."
,,Great views,5.0,,"Apart from practicality of getting to Sentosa Island, this gives great views of a number of aspects of Singapore. It is also just a ""cool"" experience."
,,Dining above all,4.0,,"My partner and I celebrated my birthday over sky dining and the experience is pretty mixed but amazing.

Why mixed feeling? I have been to many cable car trip in most cities, Singapore's cable car sky view is probably the least exciting.

The dining loop is between Mount Faber and Sentosa. Anyway, you will get a free ride from Harbourfront to Mount Faber if you decided to park your car around Vivo City Shopping Mall (Why not?). The dining is around 1.5 hours, as you eat the sky get darker and more romantic along the way. The experience is very private and you can share your happiness with your partner loudly for once without bothering anyone.

I recommend one of the partner to select the vegetarian option. The dishes are more unique.

,,Cable car ride,3.0,,"While in Singapore we had to ride the cable car, not a cheap outing but we brought the ticket that covered all the cable car rides. We did not want to actually do anything on Sentosa Island but thought a birds eye view would be nice. We also went to Mount Faber and had a walk up the hill, took some lovely photos looking back at Singapore. It is a nice relaxing way to see the views from above. Both places have somewhere to eat and drink so you will not go without while exploring."
,,Fun!,4.0,,"We went on the cable car to go over to Sentosa island on our trip to beautiful Singapore in July 2017, now to be perfectly honest, I HATE cable cars, I'm terrified of heights, but as far as terrifying experiences go, this one was not so bad, it's very high, very smooth, great views, and it's pretty cool that you actually go right through the middle of a building at the halfway point! I found it less scary that others I have been on, and as with everything in beUtiful Singapore, it's clean , the staff are very friendly and helpful and everything is well maintained. One tip, DONT go on a windy day, trust me!"
,,Birds eye view,5.0,,"Great to see parts of the city from above. Great way to get ti Sentosa Island. Grab a beer at the 7 eleven and enjoy it on the beach. Mountain view is aksi wonderful, easy MRT route home...."
,,Soar above the city,5.0,,"Your ticket buys you a trip between all four stations so wherever you get on, you can go on a scenic trip before you get to your destination. Add the shorter trip on Sentoza too and you can spend lots of time above the ground taking photos and picking out things to see when you get back to the ground."
,,Mixed feelings about this attraction,3.0,,I would like to say this was a good experience but it wasn't for us. It started with pretty poor customer service and then getting onboard during a thunderstorm. Unfortunately the cable car broke down and we were hanging there for quite a long time. Once it got going again it was very slow and it took forever to get to Sentosa. I think it gives you good views but don't go during bad weather!
,,Very nice,4.0,,"If you would like to have the ride, please ensure your ticket issuance agent as some agents are located at Vivo city mall and the cable car office is in the next builidng with around 15 - 20 mins of walking

There is another station which is near to the entrance but if you want to buy your things then vivo city entreance hall be the best

the cable car is very nice, clean and well arranged and it is peacfull with nice view on Singapore"
,,great views,5.0,,"Made the mistake of buying tickets on line before hand. If you are planning to go to Sentosa for the day, then for a few dollars more on any of the packages you get unlimited cable car usage. We saw quite a few people just ""riding the cable car"", they got on and just stayed on even when it got to the end they went round again. There was a sign saying 8 to a car, but they don't try and pack people in. Even though it was busy, they put the tree of us in our own cable car."
,,amazing cable car,5.0,,"its one of the must todo thing in singapore, it is really amazing. the view of singapore, sentosa island, sea . everything is just fabulous"
,,Day out to Sentosa,5.0,,"Not knowing what to expect, we took a taxi to Mount Faber the highest point in singapore and paid 30 dollars for the cable car to the resort island of Sentosa. Once aboard we emerged from the terminal building to be suspended above Singapore, the views were incredible and the ride was smooth. We switched cable routes on the island and rode above the beachfront, the whole trip was great fun."
,,Excellent View esp of Santosa Island Area,5.0,,"One must go for cable car when in santosa island, gives an elongated view of island as well as huge part of Singapore."
,,Singapore Cable Car,5.0,,"It is an amazing experience to go on a cable car ride with family or friends on an outing. You can have a nice dinner at Mount Faber then proceed to the cable car ride and enjoy the spectacular view during your ride. I'm sure the ride will provide you, family and friends with a memorable and joyful experience."
,,Great view,5.0,,"Take a lot of photo from cable car.
We go with cable car and came back with the train / monorail.
When you take the tickets you can choose what to do on the island.
We visit in the middle of the day, and have a great view, but I think is interesting to visit in the evening and see all the lights.
Beautiful view and beautiful pictures"
,,A hill station in the Tropics,5.0,,"Once in a while, you find an attraction that lives up to all the hype that surrounds it. The Singapore Cable Car does that with such effortless ease and panache. What a ride!!"
,,Prefer cable car route to Sentosa,4.0,,"Going to Sentosa via Cable car from Mount faber was a good experience. Good areal views of Harbour, Sentosa and trees from the cable car. If you take a package ticket from Mount faber you get 2 or 4 rides at Sentosa very cheap."
,,Expensive and lacking customer service,1.0,,A bit of a tourisp trap. We asked for a round trip to mt faber but got the combined ticket which includes the sentosa cable car. We were quite specific so they were either ripping us or just couldnt care less. That aside its still too expensive. Not worthwhile as far as I'm concerned.
,,A great opportunity to see Singapore from a different angle,5.0,,There are two cable car lines and we had tickets for both the Mount Faber and Sentosa lines. We went at sunset at the views all around were quite stunning. The cars are modern and clean and have electric fans and window vents to help control the heat. You Don't have to get on at Mount Faber but can join at Vivo City which is closer to the MET.
,,Short & Expensive,5.0,,"I last went on the cable car some 40 years old, so I had to bring my kids on, even though it was way more expensive than the monorail! Great view looking back at Santosa, but only for 7 mins. or so."
,,Relaxing way to get to Sentosa,3.0,,"Bit pricey, but a nice relaxing way to get yourself to Sentosa. The views are nice, but doesn't offer anything new to those who have been in a cable car before"
,,Great Fun,5.0,,"I paid S$39 for a year pass. That is £22 roughly. That is an absolute bargain as it allows unlimited use of the cable car on both routes as well as free access to the sentosa express monorail.

It offers excellent views from Faber throughout to Sentosa (universal studios) and then the sentosa line offers great views of the island and beaches.

Very clean cars, very smooth ride and it's just a nice place to be. I use it as a taxi ride up to Faber or to Sentosa as i live close by."
,,Interesting way to get to Sentosa,5.0,,Tried 2 ways to sentosa.. MRT to harbor front and bus to sentosa MRT to Harbor front & Cable car from Vivo City. Cable car was a unique experience. Kid enjoyed it a lot. So did we
,,A great experience.,5.0,,The best way to get the cable car experience is to buy the unlimited cable car pass. The day and night view is amazing and at night it almost feels surrealistic. You can pass hours in the cable car after the sun sets. The day ride is usually very hot and the cooling inside isn't sufficient. The night trips are one experience that you will remember in life.
,,Average views not worth price,2.0,,"If you've ever been in a cable car before then this experience offers nothing new or exciting. We were informed by the information desk near our hotel that the cable car is overpriced and not worth the time but we decided to give it a go. We were disappointed with the views as you don't see much other than the water parks on Sentosa Island, wouldn't recommend."
,,Amazing at Night!,5.0,,"If you are going to do this, do it an night. It is really romantic overlooking the lights of Singapore City. My partner and I had a cable car all to ourselves and the view was stunning. Great alternative to catching the train back from Sentosa."
,,A great view,4.0,,"I had traveled in the cable car twenty years ago and was keen to revisit and see how the skyline had changed. It is a great opportunity to see a panoramic view, including the Universal Studios castle. I loved the beaches on Sentosa Island- I am sure they were there on my last visit. Staff were particularly helpful. Lots of shops, great coffee and my only regret was that we didn't have longer to explore all the stops on the cable car. Well worth it."
,,A joke,3.0,,"Not worth the time or the money. Spent half a day taking the cable cars from mount Faber to Sentosa island, did the internal Sentosa islan cable car ride as well. Mount Faber was a joke. Ridiculous and a waste of time and money. The ride to Sentosa island and the internal ride was not as bad, however I think this experience would have been better had we taken the ride in evening."
,,Exciting way to get to Sentosa!,4.0,,The cable car is a must do to get to Sentosa. It's so exciting and a wonderful way to see so much of the island and the city. At Mt Faber there are some cool things to see like the Happiness Bells and when you go over Sentosa you can see so much and get well orientated as to how to get to the places you want to visit there. Good fun and very high!
,,A great way to see Singapore!,5.0,,"This was a fun experience! Started at Mount Faber (fantastic Mall there, Vivocity, where you could buy anything and everything--we got a lot of souvenirs there) and ended up on Sentosa Island. A great way to see Singapore! Got discount tickets from the discount ticket app from the Handy phone our hotel provided."
,,Nice and exciting experience,4.0,,"The absolytely best way to travel to Sentosa island. We were expecting the cable cars to be packed, but apparently the morning was not too busy and each time we got the cable car for our family only. Friendly staff on every station, modern cable cars make you feel safe even if you're travelling high (!!) in the air. Buy the one-day ticket so you can enjoy the rides as many times as you wish!"
,,Superb,5.0,,Amazing 360 view of singapore. Whoever going to Sentosa I strongly recommend to use the cable car. Start your trip from Mount Faber to enjoy a long ride
,,A great way to get up to Henderson Wave Bridge,5.0,,"Also a good way to se Sentosa from above, without having to wander around with hoardes of families. We did both cable cars and walked to Henderson bridge as well, a short walk, but we encountered a lot of stairs, best to keep to the road. Some reviewers have complained the it is hard to find the cable car entry at Harbourfront, we just came out of the MRT station and folowed the signs, through the shopping centre and the ship terminal area, very simple. There was no waiting for the cable car ride, at the 4 places that we got on, there was no waiting. A nice clean ride, as one would expect in Singapore."
,,Great views - go all the way around!,4.0,,"If you're going out to Sentosa - you probably are - this is the way to go there. We took the cable car from Harbourfront to Sentosa on the way out there, and on the way home we went all the way up to Mount Faber. Nice views, but difficult to get a taxi, so go up to Mt Faber, and then back down to Harbourfront (same price)."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,The cable is on of the very important things to do in singapore. the cable cars are on of the best in the world. the view is amazing and very fun activity. Not recommended for people scared of heights a floor is transparent
,,Nice Cable Experience,5.0,,"If you are in for some scenic experience in Singapore, this is highly recommended. Its' efficient and value for money. The staff here is nice and sincere. Good photo opportunities. Please ask for the return timings and make sure the availability of taxi/bus near the first terminal."
,,Annual pass now restricted to residents olny,1.0,,"When I last reviewed the Singapore Cable Car in 2015 I recommended the ""Faber Licence"" which is effectively a 12 month membership allowing unlimited rides. However, this offer is now restricted to Singapore residents and there is no multi-day pass available to visitors/tourists."
,,Fun for young kids,4.0,,"Took the kids back here today for the trip from Mt Faber across to Sentosa. Easy to park the car at Mt Faber and then just take the cable car across, provided you can leverage the annual pass. The views over the ships in the harbour are good as are the views over the attractions around Sentosa. Although the cable cars on this route are older than the other line (across Sentosa only) they at least have fans in them which can really help on a hot day."
,,A wow feeler,5.0,,You need to take this for sure.. A birds eye view on the approach to santosa island.. It covered the island beautifully. The ride had its highs and lows in terms of heights. Gives you a thrill to be feeling on top of the world..
,,Good mean of transport for exploring Sentosa,5.0,,"We purchased a package from the official site of onefabergroup and found it a very good deal. It would be even cheaper if you purchase the tickets online in advance. You just need to show them confirmation email in their official ticket counter. There are many different packages that suit different people. If you plan to visit Universal Studios and Acquarium on the same day, the cheapest would be the triple attractions package which can save SGD 30 for adult and SGD 20 for kid. We get unlimited access of both lines of the cable car and the monrail in Sentosa. Most of the tourist spots in Sentosa can be reached with them. It is advised to get a one-day sky pass rather than a single ticket unless you are just staying at one place in Sentosa."
,,Nice experience,5.0,,"Nice experience, nice ride on a rainy day. The cable car has a few stops, and you can get out at any stop to walk around."
,,Best way to get to Sentosa Island,5.0,,We didn't think this would be as much fun as it was. After deciding to purchase the ride all day option we rode both cable cars numerous times.
,,Truly magnificent views,5.0,,"Took the cable car from Harbour front on the Mt Faber line initially and then Sentosa line before going back on Mt Faber line back to original starting point.
For a family of 5, it cost $132 Sing dollars, which I thought was reasonable for the great views you get to experience, even going over the P&O cruise docked at harbour front. We spent the day at Soliso beach and there was ample time to fit in other Sentosa activities such as the luge, etc.
Loads of fun for international tourists.
Just a shame they charge international tourists more to ride on the cable car"
,,"Iconic view, must experience",5.0,,"its the best way to reach Sentosa island. its not cheap transportation but you won't regret it. its really worth its price. you can see the panoramic view of Singapore, maybe Malaysia too. so i would highly recommend this to you."
,,short but fantastic ride,5.0,,"Take the Faberline to Sentosa and you will see numerous attractions and the city traffic below you. amazing views. 8 people can sit within one car. every few minutes, there is a car. Tickets are share expensive"
,,Good mode to reach Sentosa Island,5.0,,"Singapore cable car is a good mode of transport to reach Sentosa Island, but mind you cannot take heavy baggage with you. If you want to go in the morning and come back to Singapore city in the evening, this cable car is the best way approach Sentosa island along with excellent views of the sea mountains and the city!!"
,,GREAT FUN,5.0,,"Great fun, great price and superb views don't miss out! Staff very helpful and considerate. Thoroughly recommend this!"
,,Panaromic Views of Singapore,5.0,,"The Singapore Cable car is one of the means of getting over to Sentosa island and by far the best way to do it. Although one has to shell out more money when compared to the Sentosa MRT or the bus, the journey is well worth the money. The views especially on a clear day are quiet fantastic of the harbour front and one also gets a birds eye view of the Universal Studio."
,,Comparision to other cable car,5.0,,its more exciting to ride a cable car baecause on the top you can see wide enough the beautiful scene you will see while on the run. can take pictures.
,,Well worth the money,5.0,,We paid for the unlimited rides and really enjoyed it. It is a great way to see some of Singapore and Sentosa and as s nice and relaxing. The staff were all very warm and friendly. They also take a photo of you when you start which is presented to you to buy when you get off at Sentosa. This one was quite expensive. The views are magnificent and it was really sturdy not bumpy or swaying at all
,,Pricey but worth it,5.0,,"For a family of 4 (2 adults 2 kids under the age of 10) the combined fare was over $170 Singapore dollars to ride the two cable car lines for the entire day.

Whilst not cheap, the kids and adults enjoyed a scenic ride over Sentosa and then across to Mount Faber.

If you can ride the cable car at night. It runs till approx 9pm, and the night ride gives the otherwise drab refinery and port an otherworldly blade runner type of look."
,,"Brilliant views, and exciting too!",5.0,,"What better way is there to see all of Singapore in a single swoop across the city. Starting at HarbourFront, go up to Mt Faber, then descend again through the Skyscraper and on to Sentosa Island. We also added the separate cable car trip on Sentosa Island as part of the package costing $33.

I have to say a special mention to the staff who assisted us at the cable car stations - very friendly and helpful!"
,,Something to do once,3.0,,Not the cheapest mode of transport but it is enjoyable for a day. The views are fantastic and the all day pass lets you have flexibility. Not much at Mt Faber so hopped on the delightfully clean gondola and went back to Viva
,,Amazing Views,5.0,,"This was an excellent way to get over to Sentosa. I'm a sucker for good views and this did not dissappoint. The only thing besides the hike we made up was the line. There was a machine available for people that already purchased our tickets to scan the barcode but it wasn't working. That would have prevented the line from being so long. I still highly recommend this option. Depending on the tickets you buy, you can also take the cable car that's available on the island."
,,An awesome ride back from Sentosa,5.0,,"The cable car ride back from Sentosa was awesome. At one point on the ride you can see Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia at the same time. Another enjoyable way to appreciate the beauty of Singapore."
,,The most convenient way to see Sentosa,5.0,,"The cable car consists of two lines, you have to switch stations. Start at Vivo City, then switch and you'll get to the beach of Sentosa. Great view on Singapore and Sentosa. Not cheap, but worth the money."
,,Amazing view and must to go once,5.0,,"It was part of my Sentosa ticket with 1 round of Singapore cable car.. it was an awesome experience with view of entire Singapore. .beaches and Sentosa land.
It was day trip but night trip would be 120% better experience.. go and enjoy with kids..couples. .family"
,,Cable Car,4.0,,Good photography. Great view. Get there by taxi. Mount Faber Cable Car Station. No eating places at stations.
,,Top of the world,5.0,,"We used the Cable Car to get to Sentosa. Just like everything in Singapore, the service was excellent, the cars are spotless, and my husband and I were treated with great consideration, being helped in and out of the cars by the young workers."
,,Just a sham. Ruined birthday celebration.,1.0,,"Never should you risk your time, special occasions or money for this ""dining experience"" which claims to serve gourmet food. We spent $300+ for 2 only to find that we were served stale and insipid seafood that has been frozen since Stone Age, a dessert made entirely out of whipped cream, and a box of chocolates expiring in 3 days (they further claimed that this was the delivery date and not the expiry date). The food arrives on a VERY hot ceramic plate, and the staff serves it with a glove. Very highly and presumably that their ""gourmet"" food is reheated in an oven or stove, and not made by a Chef on the spot. Don't expect any service from the staff who are not willing to go an extra mile for anything else other than serving the designated food, which of course I didn't touch my portion of at all that night. What a way to enjoy my 21st birthday celebration."
,,Wonder dinner at cable car,4.0,,"It's wonderful to have dinner on cable car.
However, I was dizzy after had the dinner, maybe lack of oxygen at cable car.
The worst thing was that no one helped me at all even I sat on the floor.
I think it was good experience to enjoy the dinner during sunset.
You must enjoy it especially you like the view at cable car.
The traffic was not convenient and we need to call taxi when we left the station.
It is better to take the cable car if you stayed at Sentosa."
,,The hard part is finding the starting place,4.0,,"If you want to see the marina area of Singapore from high up, and don't mind paying SGD29 per person for the privilege, then this is for you. First, however, make sure you find Farber Hill, where it originates."
,,Adventure ride,4.0,,If u take the cable from mount fabor which is highest peak in Singapore then u get most time on the cable car.Most of its length is over the sea..Although due to height it makes u nervous but it is actually a very smooth travel.It takes u inside sentosa and u can have a overlook of the whole park from here.Its cool and u should try but maybe not a must do activity.
,,Great,5.0,,"Many years ago I was tricked into going to Santosa by this means
of transport and when asked what I wanted to do when we ""landed"" said I needed and"" brandy and dry"" to calm my nerves-
however this time with the more modern system I throughly
enjoyed it."
,,Off to Sentosa,5.0,,A great way of getting to Sentosa and around the Island. A wonderful experience for our grandkids. However getting back to Mount Faber in late afternoon there was a lack of taxis.
,,A fun experience,5.0,,We went from harbour town to sentosa on the cable car & had long confused walk to find the entry but when on it wow what a wonderful experience with views to everywhere it was well worth it.
,,A great way to get some amazing views,5.0,,"I suppose it depends on the time you arrive as we did not have to wait long for our tickets though have been told there could be huge queues. It is almost certainly the quickest way to get to Sentosa.

It is definitely worth the price of the ticket as you get some amazing views and a completely different perspective of the harbour and surrounding islands. It is a hive of activity seeing it from above.

A highlight of our trip and we are sure it will be for other families. Just do it."

,,NICE AND LONG TRIP,4.0,,Lovely and nice view and one should visit atleast one cable car to see the ariel view .specially in second half
,,A Wild Experience,5.0,,A great way to visit Sentosa Island. Pay to use both cable cars. It is only a few extra dollars. You can get off at each stop and look around. You could visit the island for the whole day so maybe plan a second visit to include Universal Studio's.
,,Singapore Cable Car,5.0,,"Easy access by taxi or SMRT. Provides quick, easy timely transportation to Sentosa Island and various attractions on the island such as Universal Studios. Offers great views of the waterfront areas of Singapore."
,,Scenic......,4.0,,Its a verh good cable car as the ground which it covers down and the scenic beauty of singapore which you get to see is simply unmatchable..........great experience
,,"Good way to get to Sentosa, great views",5.0,,Got tack to Mount Faber cable car station. Can buy Universal Sudios and Aquarium tickets at the same time. Difficult to get tack at Mount Faber. Cable cars ar clean and air conditioned.
,,Well balanced,5.0,,"The cable car runs between harbour front and mount Faber we had taken a round trip.The cable car is very sturdy and well balanced so you do not feel scared.It gives you a beautiful aerial view of Singapore specially the sentosa island.
There is another cable car that takes you around sentosa island we took a round trip in it also to get the view and accessibility to various places within sentosa island like the waterfront resorts ,beach,madam Tussauds Wax museum etc."
,,Amazing views of Singapore!,5.0,,"It is recommended to start your journey from Faber Peak towards Sentosa Island (your ticket is roundtrip). The one-way journey is around 30 minutes. You will witness amazing views of Singapore and the surrounding water on a clear day. Each cable car seats around 6 people. It is recommended to take a taxi to Faber Peak, as it is the most convenient way to get to the cable car station. Once at Sentosa Island, there are numerous activities for all ages."
,,Swinging On A Star,4.0,,"A little difficult to find when you are in Sentosa Park. Grabbed the last cable car up to Mount Faber. My son is always afraid of heights, but he loved the view, as did I! All the twinkling lights popping on below us was fun to watch."
,,Great,5.0,,"Very good place. Clean. Management was good. Nice best place to visit. Sentosa island , is damn good."

,,Enjoy the Scenic Ride to the State of Fun,4.0,,Hop on to Singapore's cable car to the Sentosa Island or the State of Fun. Immerse yourself in this wonderful ride which offers a spectacular birds-eye view of the island and the main city. Do get round trip tickets or opt for value tickets which offer admission to the exciting places of interests in the Sentosa Island.
,,Great View,4.0,,The Cable Car offers some great views of Singapore. It is not the cheapest ticket around but it is worth it for those views.
,,Astounding view!!,5.0,,Have no words..View from cable car is spectacular!! Enjoyed a lot..Enjoyed the ride till Sentossa. Please take round trip tickets. Otherwise you need to walk a lot. You can also get down in each station before Sentossa and just roam around..Don't miss it..strongly recommended :)
,,Great View !!!,5.0,,When you are in Singapore don't miss this ride.You can opt for a short trip or for a trip till Sentosa.The view from the Car is worth for what you pay.If you are strong enough just look at the hook which holds the car with the rope and you will not stop appreciating this Engineering feat ( look at the snaps attached )
,,"Great views, easy to access, clean compartments",4.0,,"We took the MRT and arrived at the cable car, it was easy to get tickets, the view from the cars was great, we didn't do anything on the island just enjoyed the cable car trip.
Big shopping centre near by so easy to find lunch etc.
We worth visiting"
,,When Universal Studios may be too much...,4.0,,This was our style of ride. Great views of Sentosa. Recommended. Would buy an annual pass if you are likely to go back - not much more expemsive.
,,Exciting,5.0,,Fantastic view... feels like you are soaring high... once in a lifetime experience... wanted more of the ride
,,S'pore Cable Car,5.0,,"Particularly because Singapore is primarily flat, it makes the cable car experience all that more meaningful. Great views."
,,Awesome view,5.0,,We opted for the two-way cable car trip and it was a wise decision as the view was amazing from some height.
,,Kids will love it.,5.0,,"Little expensive, but a must visit, opt for the Mount faber to Sentosa line, nearly 10 minute ride one way. Full city view from top with sea, mountain , hotels and forest."
,,Excellent view,5.0,,Worth the price paid to have a bird's eye view of the Singapore horizon. I strongly recommend this ride.
,,Cable car views good,3.0,,"As with everything in Singapore it was expensive. If you include the Sentosa ""package"" then hideously expensive ($101)!
I would not recommend going to Universal Studios"" unless you have deep pockets & a long life expectancy (queues for rides were 40-80 minutes). Good for kids I guess - good luck mum & dad!!"
,,really great,5.0,,i have travelled by this enjoyed a lot with view and great secured travelling . one must travel by this.
,,Roads are in the Sky!!!,5.0,,This is a great experience in Singapore. If you're visiting Sentosa Island then at least one way cable car is recommended. You'll have a full view of Singapore Costa. This is 1.5 to 2Km long route but if you visit by road to Sentosa it will take min 30 min.
,,Good views of the Island,4.0,,We took cable car to enter Sentosa Island. It was a package trip which covered both Mount Faber Line and Sentosa Line. Breathtaking views from the cable car. Not much crowded unlike other attractions in Sentosa.
,,Great Views at reasonable price,5.0,,"We may have been lucky because it was a Friday, but there was no queues to speak of. We got the combined ticket for both lines and stopped everywhere and saw everything. Amazing views and so easy to use"
,,What a view,5.0,,"The only way to go to Sentosa island, caught the cable car from the highest point, the views were spectacular from start to finish, cable cars fit 8 people and are comfortable, can purchase an range of ticket types, like return, one way, stop at half way point, and a ticket which allows you also use the cable car on Sentosa that takes you to a fort."
,,A great way to visit Sentosa,5.0,,Great suspended high above the water a fast trip to Sentosa there is a midway stop but we did not get off until reaching Sentosa
,,Cable car - Good experience,5.0,,"A well maintained service offering breathtaking views. Connects between harbourfront and the sentosa island. And it also connects the Imphia station inside the sentosa park and siloso place. But tickets are to be bought separately. Been in it with family and everyone liked the way it is maintained. A safe secure,clean service to try. Worth a try."
,,Incredible go at night,5.0,,"We used it to leave universal studios at night and took it all the way up to Faber Mountain then back down to the harbour.

Wow... the views across the harbour and the city from above at night are simply incredible.

It was £32UK for the trip from Sentosa to Faber then back to Harbour for two people, £16 each. Not cheap as a form of transport but cheap for the experience.

A must do in Singapore"
,,Great experience,5.0,,"LIke everything else in Singapore the whole experience is clean, fast, well sorted out and flows really well. You can buy a ticket that allows you access to both Sentosa and Faber Peak. It is a bit confusing when trying to read the information and pricing however think of it as a round trip ticket with one stop allowed at each cable car point. So you can go to Sentosa from Singapore, then hop on the line that runs across Sentosa, then back onto the line that takes you back to Singapore and up to Faber Peak then back down to your starting point. Worth going to Faber peak and having a drink up there as the view is wonderful. We went during the week and was very quiet, no queues at all, Each cable car can take 8 people and they will fill them up when there are lots of people but if not many you get your own car! May be different on the weekend when people who live in Singapore go over to Sentosa. I felt Sentosa is more for those with children however adults can enjoy the various attractions, beaches etc. The ride across is fun for everyone!"
,,Perfect addition to the Sentosa,5.0,,"Do's
Well Managed & Perfectly designed.
No over-loading of passengers, 1 cabin for each family.
Carry water bottle and biscuits, chips.
We spent more than 1 hour in total.

Don't de-board on mount faber. Try to read map first, then only board the cable car after you plan your journey."
,,Had an amazing trip,5.0,,"Make sure you purchase both mount faber line & sentosa line, you can get down on each point and room around the places. I would recommend you to take cable car to go to sentosa instead of train."
,,what amazing day!!,5.0,,I took the cable car with my family when going to Sentosa Island. The experience was really valuable and nice. I really recoomend it.
,,Nice,5.0,,"Travelled within Sentosa, useful as otherwise you need to walk a lot from one end to another. Nice experience."
,,Great way to get to Sentosa Island,5.0,,Very efficient operators. When not too busy they let you have a gondola to yourselves so is quite personal and easy to take photos from all sides.
,,Actually an alternative transport in Singapore!!,4.0,,"Normally, a cable car is more of an attraction in most of the places, especially for viewing scenery from heights. But the Singapore Cable car is actually a transportation option which transports us to different station similar to a train.

The network is extensive with multiple lines and since everything in Singapore and Sentosa is connected through Escalators and lifts, it is easier to travel through these."
,,Great view of the harbour,5.0,,Stunning Views from the cable cars of the city and harbour; enjoyable way to get to Sentosa and Universal Studios.
,,Over the land and sea,4.0,,"this ride was over the land and sea, and comfortable 8 seater cable car ride. If at the right time, we get to see the cruise ships as well. Provides a very good view throughout."
,,Fun viewing from cable car,4.0,,"3 routes to choose from: mainland to Sentosa island, on Sentosa and also up Faber mountain. The whole system is well maintained and you will enjoy a safe ride!"
,,Something to do at least once,4.0,,"If your kids have never been in a cable car, and your itinerary for the day is not too packed, this is a great family activity to do, to lead up to other activities that you are interested to cover on Sentosa Island. You get a good bird eyes view of the island and the ride is at a very relaxed pace. The staff on duty were generally helpful and facilities around from ticketing, F&B, gift shops were adequate. For this trip we bought the unlimited pass with Mount Faber as our start and end point. The management has come up with lots of ticketing options/package deals which allows you to pick several activities on the island to be added on to the cable car rides. Best to check out their website for more details so that you can plan and decide whether the deals are worth your while."
,,Lovely Views,4.0,,"Well worth the experience, you can purchase the second cable car located on the island at the same time. We boarded at the harbour front and visited the peak first before catching the cable car down to the island"
,,Nice view!,4.0,,Relaxing and nice view over the Sentosa island. Didnt take to faber mountain as we didnt have time. Buy a ticket for more activities in Sentosa Island and get this as part of that.
,,Stunning Views,5.0,,Amazing views across Singapore and the South China Sea. Get to the top of Mt Faber and then go for a walk to take in the beautiful rainforest and further stunning views.
,,"""Great views""",5.0,,"We caught the cable car in a thunder storm which was a little scary, but the views are well worth the trip a great end to a day on Sentosa island."
,,Good trip with nice views,4.0,,Nice and easy way to go to Sentosa. Good views. I enjoyed a lot going there by cable car. I have chosen both: to go to the island and go along it. The bus there is free.
,,Fun for Everyone,4.0,,Best way to be in Sentosa Island!! Comfortable and very good service.Children will love the ride. Excellent views.
,,Aerial Link,4.0,,This is a Aerial link from Mount Faber to Sentosa. We get to see the harbors beneath during the aerial ride. Children will love this ride as this is calm.
,,A bit of fun.,5.0,,A very relaxing CableCar ride over to Sentosa island. Great visit and very clean comfortable cars. Good idea to buy tickets for both lines. One over return but also there is another cable car ride on the Island that takes you on a leisurely view of the area. Beautiful view.
,,Brill time,5.0,,My husband booked this for my birthday we had a 3 course meal on board with champagne birthday cake and chocolates it was amazing the views were great even though it started to rain when we got off we were given a bell to go and tie to the bell of hope after cocktails in this beautiful setting we boarding again in time to see the fire works going off on Sentosa highly recommend this for a birthday honeymoon extra
,,Go for it !,4.0,,This cable car ride from the Mount faber peak to the Sentosa covers two different landscapes with a ride above the rain forest and also above the sea to reach the Senotsa island. Children will love this cable car ride. It is quite different experience during day time and again when the night falls. Ride this cable car to experience it.
,,Great View,5.0,,"Great view, tends to be a little warm. Not too much to do in Sentosa if you are not with family/young children. I nice afternoon visit with a drink on the beach."
,,A Great Experience with Family,4.0,,"It was a last minute unplanned trip on a Sunday afternoon, my family and I decided to visit Sentosa island via the Singapore Cable Car after having our lunch at VivoCity mall. We boarded the cable car from Harbour Front tower 2, just 5 mins walk from VivoCity mall.

Tickets were fairly priced, $33 per adult for a return trip on the Faber and Sentosa line. Faber line is the link from Mount Faber up till Sentosa island, then we alighted and walked about 3 mins to Imbiah Lookout station to hop on the Sentosa line which we took to Siloso beach, got off for a bit of sightseeing then boarded again to Merlion station to view the famous giant Merlion statue. The price tag per ticket wasn't too bad if you have plans to visit the whole island and stop over at Mount Faber for some nice views.

The cable car itself was quite solid and it didn't shake mid air. Though it can get super hot and humid due to the hot weather and there were no fans or air cond available in the cable car except cooling fresh air from outside which we could hardly feel. So be prepared to sweat, and definitely wear beach or short clothing.

Overall, we enjoyed the ride and this is definitely a must go to ride at least once, if you visit Singapore or Sentosa island."
,,Excellent view and must visit,5.0,,The cable car is a must to do activity in Singapore. The complete trip is split into 2 parts 1 is giving you view of the city and 2nd part give you view of Sea and santosa. This is one of the worlds highest cable car.
,,For amazing views,5.0,,"Travelled from Mount Faber to Sentosa, and return from Sentosa to Harbourfront. Views were great. Definitely the way to go to Sentosa"
,,Really nice,4.0,,Liked the experience although the one in hongkong is simply amazing. But once at Sentosa it is great.
,,Take advantage of the full trip,5.0,,Definitely take advantage of the full cable car trip by heading up to Mount Faber before you go across to Sentosa. It is actually reasonably priced if you get the right ticket.
,,Amazing Views,5.0,,I decided to use the Cable car instead of Taxi or Train route. It is really worth as you will get an excellent view of Singapore
,,Short But Sweet Ride,4.0,,"We have taken the cable car many times. Our first trip was the longer one from Mt. Faber. Other trips were from harbourfront.
You want to stay on it because it is so pleasant, especially on a blue sky and sunny day! Do not be afraid. The cables are quite thick, The access on and off are very easy. It is a great introduction to Sentosa Island and its venues. I recommend a round trip ticket. Families may wish one way and take the wooden walkway back to Harbourfront. Be sure to get a map when you land on Sentosa regardless of how you arrive. The map and trams are very helpful."
,,Mount Faber Line and Sentosa Line,4.0,,"So we bought return ticket for this cable car. We experienced beautiful scenery, both for Mount Faber line and Sentosa Line. Most writers will suggest to have fun and take photos in Mount Faber. Unfortunately, we couldnt do that because particular reason :( Hope we could go there someday :)"
,,RIDE OK BUT NO THRILL,3.0,,"We went for the ride on the evening of 19 May,2017. It was okay riding in a car above the trees and water but it was no thrill or excitement. It was just like any other ride."
,,Astonishing view up here,5.0,,"There are 3 lines of cable car in Sentosa. The ticket price for all lines (no limited times of travelling) is around S$65 a person. I can't remember clearly, but it is a bit expensive. The cabinet is well designed and the view up there is magnificent during day and night, especially when neon lights in Sentosa are lit up."
,,unique experience,4.0,,Well you must take a ride on this wonderfull cable car as it provides awesome view of sentosa island and Universal studios from top and it is one of the top attraction of sentosa island as well.
,,another option to see the Singapore Skyline,5.0,,I suggest taking ride in the morning and another ride in the evening to better appreciate the Singapore Skyline. Offers a great view in 360. Every station has something to offer.
,,Great views,5.0,,"I think this is a must if your travelling to Singapore , the views are great and it takes you across to Sentosa where you can fill your day up doing various things on the island"
,,Great way to get to Sentosa,5.0,,This attraction is a great way to get to Sentosa and to get brilliant views night and day. Well run and such fun. It seats up to 8 people. It would be better if a small group had the car to themselves when they are not busy. We were a group of 4 and ended up with 2 people in the middle finding it hard to get those fabulous views without switching seats or screwing around in the seat.
,,Dinner in the sky.,5.0,,We went there to celeberate our anniversary. We booked ourselves for dinner deal. It was great view and awesome time. They made a yummy cake for us. Very nice. The only negative was that it was very rushed. Must try for an experience.
,,A brilliant way to view the Singapore skyline,4.0,,"A great way to get to Sentosa, we took the cable car across to visit Singapore Universal Studios and it made a very interesting ride across. Not sure I would do it to simply turn around and come back again but if you're already making the trip, it's definitely worthwhile. Great views and felt very safe indeed, if it's quiet you'll get a car to yourself which is even better."
,,sentosa island,5.0,,i don't like heights but braved this for the spectacular island.even though it rained so much to do.
,,Cable Car,3.0,,"It's a cable car experience you will find similar with other cable cars. More expensive, too short ride and nothing new."
,,fun in the rain on all the rides,5.0,,"take time and get off to explore all the stops this is a great way to see this area of Singapore, don't forget to stop off at the beach"
,,Another Must Visit!,5.0,,"It takes you to Sentosa!! flying on the harbour and going past the Resort World Resort, its amazing, must visit and good fun with the kids as well as the views are fantastic."
,,One of the things to do,4.0,,"We did for the view, rode out to Sentosa and back. Nice cars, I think they were air conditioned so comfortable. A few photo opportunities, but a bit expensive."
,,Life time experience,5.0,,Heard so much about this attraction it was much more than we expected a must for anybody visiting Singapore
,,SOARING HIGH WITH PANORAMIC VIEWS,5.0,,"It’s the second time we travelled to Singapore as family. We stayed in Sentosa during our first time and was able to experience the cable car without going to Mt. Faber. When we decided to go back to Singapore for the second time, we opted to stay in Conrad near Suntec City but we must ride again the cable car so that my youngest would also experience it.

This time, we did ride the 2 cable car lines that connect TWO vibrant destinations – Sentosa and Faber Peak Singapore. Soaring high with beautiful views below, it was a great experience. We saw the top views of Sentosa attractions such as the Merlion, Adventure Cove, the Cruise ship along the sea, the forest and some skyscraper. We were able to go to Mt Faber and able to ring the Bell of Happiness. We really enjoyed the precious views, it is one of the best way to see the aerial view of Singapore. Don’t leave Singapore without trying it."
,,Great trip,5.0,,Went over to Sentosa on the cable car - great ride with great views. Very smooth and didn't have to wait long.
,,Good overview of Sentosa and environs,4.0,,"The cable car gives an overview of Sentosa and the sprawling development explosion that has occurred there in recent times. The views are simply spectacular.

Drawbacks include the cost of the ride, plus the hassle of standing in line to buy the tickets.

Nevertheless, if you are not afraid of heights, this is one Singapore experience that should be had at least once."
,,classic must do in Singapore,4.0,,"Although I enjoyed this ride. I wish it was easier to locate the place where you can begin the ride. We had a hard time searching around VIVO only to find out..it is a bit far from there. Nonetheless, it is a must do in Singapore"
,,Wow!,5.0,,Aside from I conquered my fear of heights the view of Siloso beach from above is breath taking. At first I really want to go down in the next station. But after that I want to ride again. Its a very unforgettable experience. I will surely ride the cable car during my next visit.
,,Going to Santosa.,5.0,,Buy tickets for all that you wish to do & the cable car ride at Santosa at the ticket office at the Harbuor Front Tower.
,,Best in Singapore,5.0,,"One of the best things to do in Singapore is try the cable car. The view from it is really awesome, one can see the whole Singapore. The whole experience is really awesome."
,,Nice views,5.0,,"It was part of sentosa 1 day pass which we bought. Nice attraction, we can see the Sentosa Island. and its mode of transport to the Sislo Beach"
,,A good way to see the scenery.,5.0,,"Soaring high above the city, the water and the island which is essentially a huge theme park was very interesting."
,,Good for one time,5.0,,The cable car experience is good for one time only. Its little expensive but can be done once if your are going to sentosa.
,,"Quote expensive for the short ride, and alright-views",2.0,,"The views are something you can get in even if you walk down towards sentosa. The Cable car itself is a supposedly a part of the public transport system, and costs 35$ for a single journey!"
,,Great views,5.0,,"Very popular , lots of tourists, big queue to buy tickets but worth it, we went form Mt. Faber , just did a round trip over Sentosa island. Planned to visit island on another day"
,,A very nice place,5.0,,Take the cable car from a 15-story building Expensive price It is amazing with attractions It cost me $ 69 if I remember It is highly recommended
,,AMAZING,5.0,,Went there at around 8;30 and the views were incredible i loved every minute of this ride but stay away if you fear heights
,,Bird's View of Sentosa,5.0,,"A great experience travelling through Cable Car. We took from Harbourfront to sentosa, It was 29SGD on May 2017 for two way travel. The view of sentosa island from top is nice. should travel once during your visit. In the night while coming back the view was changed with colorful lights sparkling across the island"
,,Nice to experience it,4.0,,Worth going once for the experience. There is nothing much to do at the Faber peak. So you can go till Faber peak and come back. You get a good view of the singapore port.
,,See the harbour,5.0,,Worlds busiest harbour........goes on forever. And the sights of Singapore you only see from the airs. A must do!
,,Cloud 9 is the way to go,5.0,,We had a 4 course meal over 3 round trips starting at 6pm till about 7:30. It was fantastic to watch the turn from day to night over a red and some very nice food.
,,Once is enough!,3.0,,"Very expensive way to travel, but of course once in the day and once in the night is enough for a good view of the island. And for the thrill.

Of course, there's the glass top one, not for those scared of heights, which is interesting. A little pricey as well, so do go to Carousell or Groupon and wait for their discounts and offers."
,,Majestic View of the Port,5.0,,We took this ride to get down to Sentosa. This offers a majestic view of the Singapore Port. We would recommend you take in ride on a nice clear day and make sure you also take the Ride in the Night if you are returning from Sentosa. The Day and later Night view will surely give a Wow feeling.
,,Good views,4.0,,Interesting views of the Sentosa island leading up to Faber Peak - worth a trip. Lots of tourist shops.
,,Ticketing Is Painfully Slow,3.0,,"You can catch Singapore Cable Car at the Harbourfront. Ticketing is extremely and painfully slow. For S$33, you can ride both the Mount Faber Line and Sentosa Line (both ways for those two lines). It starts on the 16th floor of the building and go over the city. It is quite a view."
,,Breathtaking view of Sentosa Island and Singapore,5.0,,Its a must do if you are getting to Sentosa island from mainland. The view is mesmerizing from the top especially at night time.
,,Cablecar experience,4.0,,"Amazing way to travel, especially for not experienced. Wonderful sights from above and landscapes. Strong emotions"
,,hang loose in the sky above Singapore ocean terminal,4.0,,"The cable car attraction has been a tourist highlight for over 30 years and continues to be "" a must "" when visiting, The cable car / chairlift is the ideal way to travel to Sentoso and offers spectacular unequaled views"

,,Great views,5.0,,Caught cable car to Sentosa island from mount Fabre with family on our recent trip to Singapore. Great views of the water shop and Sentosa. Good fun and views.
,,Really enjoyable,5.0,,Even though I went during the rain I really enjoyed this. The length of Singapore that can be travelled with a ticket is great so if you don't want to do the tourist bit of sentosa you can go to the other parts for walks. I like how it comes alongside the sentosa merlion which is awesome in the dark!
,,Birds eye trip to Sentosa,4.0,,Get on at Faber Peak to go to Sentosa Island and coming back get off at the Harbourfront stop. Then you can cruise through the enormous Harbourfront Shopping Mall
,,Great feeling,5.0,,"Since we were scared of heights, were a bit sceptical. Great feeling and wonderful view from above. Have never been an adventurous person and enjoyed the ride. We can use the cable car in Sentosa island also with the same ticket, but we were not informed at the counter or by our guide. Hence make sure u use the ride."
,,Amazing Singapore sea view,4.0,,You can get spectacular views from inside cable. If you came from faber park you will get mount view and then sea view in the mid way. Can see amazing Singapore port from up there. The best time for view is sunset time. Staff there also friendly.
,,Enjoy Riding!,3.0,,"Riding a cable car might not be strange to someone. But for us, it was a great time enjoyed together above the sea level. The original price of the ticket is kinda expensive but we got a contact who sells with discount price. So, we bought tickets for Harbourfront Station to Mount Faber (Round) and Harbourfront to Sentosa Station (Round). First, you need to go to Habourfront Tower which you can ride MRT (Circle and Purple LIne). Then, head to Mount Faber First and if you want to spend sometimes there, get out off the cable car and enjoy the picturesque view. There was a souvenir shop, too. After that, go back to cable car station and take a ride to Sentosa Station via Harbourfront Station. For us, we did not get out of the cable car and took ride to Sentosa. But, one of the family who got out of the car need to get in again with our cable car to sentosa station. Whatever, we enjoyed the ride with them, too. We are amazed by the color of the sea which is very clean and green. Moreover, you can see some private boats along the shore. For the line of Harbourfront to Mount Faber, you can enjoy the green views which is the mountain sides. For your information, there is a new cable car line to Sentosa Merlion (I don't know where it starts.) Enjoy your ride if you are in Lion City!"
,,Lovely experience,5.0,,We travelled over to Sentosa on the cable car and really enjoyed the experience. It was good value for money and a lovely way to enjoy the view of Singapore.
,,Nice ride,4.0,,We were going to Sentosa and as we found discounted tickets (approx. 25 USD) we decided to buy. If you come to Singapore it is a must experience attraction as it is a nice ride and the view is beautiful.

,,Beautiful Cable Car,5.0,,"Of my travels after the Genting Cable car in Malaysia , I would rate the Singapore cable car second best, in my experience, the ticket counter well accessible, the cable car had 2-3 stops for sentosa, be sure , if you plan for sentosa, don't get down prior, we got down, and were literally confused, luckily our tickets allowed us to hop back in.Visit for a good experience."
,,360° Awesome views,5.0,,"From Vivo mall or vice versa to Santosa island this cable ride is Awesome.
Accessible by SIA hop on bus stop or closest MRT station.
A day of fun in Santosa island to blast the budget on young and old.
From Madame Tussards ,water sports, adrenaline rides to indoor skydiving something to suit everyone.
Views surrounding you of beautiful city.
Prepare to spend whole day.
Always have comfortable shoes and an umbrella in case of passing shower.
Staff and service are excellent."
,,Expensive Option for families,4.0,,The family enjoyed the ride but with no family ticket on offer it was an expensive way to get to Sentosa. Next time I would use the bridge or get a taxi.
,,Great views!,5.0,,"The views and scenery all along from the cable ride is fantastic. The harbour, the sea, sentosa island plus it's a good way to goto Sentosa Island. We took the cable car from the Vivo City. It's pricey but worth it at least once for sure. So go for it :)"
,,Great Views,3.0,,Great views from Mt Faber as you cross to Sentosa. Wasn't a fan of Sentosa and found the cable car a little over priced for what it was. Didn't like the cheesy photo also which they insist on taking...
,,Great experience to take amazing pictures,5.0,,Very recommended for those into landscape photography - a nice walking distance from the Marina Bay Sands if you are staying there.
,,best way to get to Sentosa,5.0,,"by far the coolest way to get to Sentosa, awesome view of, Singapore, the harbour, forests & Sentosa. Love it."
,,Good view but expensive,3.0,,"I have been on cable car at several places including Hong Kong, Hakone in Japan etc. I consider them superior to this due to their better views, long duration and cost effective too.
Nothing bad about this but SG is in general expensive. Good view of Sentosa island and harbor."
,,Great views,5.0,,We crossed over to Santosa Island by cable cart. Stunning views. Easy access. Would highly recommend for family to do the ride. Will definitely do it again.
,,A little pricey,4.0,,"This is a bit pricey, but you will see some wonderful views. People working here are friendly, and you can get a round-trip price."
,,A sensational view of the city,5.0,,We took the kids a night cable car view of the city. The views were breathtaking especially for a person not a huge fan of heights. Best to go at night as it makes it that so much more special. Kids loved it. It was over before we new it. Only 10-15 the whole journey. Maybe we will do it again in the day light just to see one of Singapores beautiful Sunrises.
,,"Nice views, no taxis",4.0,,"On recommendation from an Uber driver we took the cable car from Mt Faber. The cost was $29 return which we thought was a little expensive, but it was a good experience. The views were fantastic and it's a great way to get to Sentosa Island. There are lifts and elevators at all stops (you can hop off at Vivo City) so it is pretty accessible.
I would have given a five rating, but what let it down for us was once we got back to Mt Faber there were no taxis. There was a little stand with a number on it but we didn't have phone access. There is apparently free wifi, but none of us could log on. The staff wouldn't call us a taxi but said we could go back to Vivo City (no extra charge) and get a cab from there. So we had to line up to get back on.
It would be good if this was explained when tickets were purchased as we were tired by this time (after spending a few hours on Sentosa) and the last thing we wanted to do was line up again."
,,Great view,5.0,,We went from Mount Faber to Sentosa via the cable car. Easy to book online and quick and easy journey. View is breathtaking.
,,Geat Views,5.0,,"We Got this in a package deal , wont normally pay this much to go on it for what it is , but great views"
,,Don't Miss This Experience!,5.0,,"What a fab time we had! Take the train shuttle to Sentosa Island, have a wander around (it won't take you long unless you're going to Universal Studios) then catch the cable car right the way up to the top of Faber Mountain.

At the top there's a restaurant where you can get a bite to eat & a drink & take in the views of the port. Don't forget to ring the 'Happiness Bell' out in the garden area as well.

Well worth doing & it would appear that not a lot of tourists know about this as it wasn't overcrowded at all. The cable cars are clean & it's a smooth ride - really memorable. Afterwards, get the cable card back to the mid point at Harbour Front then catch your train to wherever you want to go to next."
,,Usual day out,5.0,,"Booked cable car through our room handy phone for 18$S 3 stops on way to Santosa Island checked out cruise terminal not much to see there,carried on to island over Universal studios below with swimming and shark pools 3 places to go at end we choose the beach, very nice then went back via cable car to the others. Could have used the train to go back but used cable car again."
,,Great way to see Sentosa on a limited time,5.0,,"It gives a breathtaking view of the island. Since we didn't have enough time to explore Sentosa, taking the cable car ride allowed us to see and hop off on the spots most interesting to us. 👍"
,,Awesome city views,5.0,,A must vist one time..from Mount Faber peak to Sentosa Island...the views are totally amazing and you would get some amazing birds eye views of the city around you.
,,Great Sentosa overview,5.0,,"This was a terrific way to get to Sentosa and see what was there, get an idea of the layout as well as see other Singapore sights."
,,Great views,4.0,,"Nice views, providing its not raining, you can see for miles on a clear day. My only whinge was that some cultures clearly don't do queuing so feel free to barge people out of your way!"
,,Kids love this,5.0,,We caught the cable car across Sentosa a few times while we stayed there. It's very clean and the staff are friendly. Would have loved to do the other line but ran out of time.
,,Worth Taking a Ride,5.0,,Atleast you should take one ride. View is awesome. Take entire loop ride to save cost. Don't miss it. Really enjoyable experience.
,,WEL LWORTH THE RIDE,5.0,,"This is well worth the ride., The cabin is very roomy and plenty of windows which enable a good view all round. The overall ride to Sentosa Island was good. The views especially going over the cruise ships is rivetting. You can see all over Sentosa as well as Singapore from a height. The only problem is going back, there are no taxis at Mount Faber so you have to go back to the stop before which is the cruise centre to get a cab."
,,Try its great experience,5.0,,"This is one great cable car ride ,plenty to photograph on the way to Sentosa,book before you go as this saves time queuing, kids love it so do mums and dads"
,,Too pricey cable car ride,4.0,,Cable car round trip from mount Faber to sentosa n back in the evening is priced at SGD33 per head....Take a city tourist map n avail a 10% discount....The tickets price include fare in sentosa cable car from merlion to Imbiah to siloso point n back....The staff at mount Faber do not explain this n if u do not study ur tkt properly you miss out on using this coupon....Like we did....We only requested for a cable car ride tkt to sentosa n back...But the staff offered only this option...Making it a Take it or leave it situation...
,,A must to do.,5.0,,What an awesome trip we had on all the cable cars. Such beautiful views and places to visit while doing this trip.
,,It's like going to Jurassic pk,5.0,,The cable car starts with a lovely Koi Pond for you to relax around. This offers a great view of the harbour.
,,Great views high above Singapore,5.0,,"The Singapore Cable Car joins Mount Faber with Sentosa Island.
Taking you high above Singapore, pausing at the high level stop in a high rise office block. So long as you can cope with heights, this is a great way to get from one location to the other."
,,Fabulous views,5.0,,"My husband hates heights, but decided to brave the cable car. We really enjoyed it. It was a quiet day so we did not have to share our car. The views are outstanding and the car feels reasonably stable. Highly recommended."
,,Unique Travel Experience,4.0,,Travelling from Mount Faber to Sentosa Island via cable car is an unique way to see a great island attraction. The views are spectacular and well worth the experience
,,LOVELY VIEW,5.0,,"At first I was a little afraid of using the cable car but it was very good and the view is fantastic, so would recomend this to anyone"
,,Good views,4.0,,"If you are scared of heights don't worry, their safety record is exceptional ... I asked because I done like heights yet alone glass cabins. I would be lying if I said I wasn't scared but once the journey started you relaxed a little and enjoyed the views. I would do it again."
,,Pidgeon's eye view,4.0,,The Cable Cars are a fun way to see Singapore from another angle. Starting at Mount Faber you can descend to Senosa island then traverese it on another line. Best do this in the morning before all the other tourists arrive and you'll have a car to yourself (and a beach on the island).
,,Singapore Must Do !!!!!!,5.0,,"The chair lift takes you over to Sentosa island, from there you can catch another chair ride across the island. Great views from the cabins and there are theme parks on the island if you are into that type of entertainment."
,,Lovely view of sentosa,5.0,,I choose option of unlimited travel by cable car on sentosa island. Travelling over island was wonderful experience. One could see all attractions and facilities of sentosa island. Tried the view of island after sunset and it was awesome. One can see beautiful night view of singapore harbor. I would recommend travel once for anyone visiting sentosa.
,,Amazing views,4.0,,"This was a great way to see Singapore and once we were on it it wasn't too busy so (despite only being two people) we always got a car to ourselves!
Although we had booked tickets in advance, we ended up queuing to get a paper voucher - afterwards we realised we could have used a machine to pick up our ticket without queuing at all!! Keep your eyes peeled."
,,see 360 degree view of Singapore,4.0,,"If you plan to visit Sentosa Island, Cable car is one of your choice. You can get on The cable at Vivo City and get off at Sentosa Island."
,,Awesome view!,5.0,,"My husband and I did the cable car trip from Sentosa Island. We did both routes, including the Mount Faber line which takes you back over to the city on a return trip.

It was amazing. We had a cable car to ourselves and the views were fab.

It's very high so definitely something to be aware of if you're scared of heights.

But if you can overcome the height it's a great way to see the sights."
,,Top view of Sentosa n port nearby,4.0,,There are two line for this. One which connects to few attractions in Sentosa n other which connects vivo city mall n Sentosa. For top view of Sentosa n sea its a best place to be.
,,Lovely views,4.0,,Great views of the city and harbour. Great way to travel into Sentosa as you can see everything on the island. Reasonable priced.
,,A great way to get to Sentosa,5.0,,My husband decided that we would take the Cable car to Sentosa and we were not disappointed. The views were fantastic and we saw a lot more than we would have traveling any other way.
,,A Must Include.,5.0,,Just a lovely way to get to Sentosa & take in all the views over the water.So much to see I did the ride a couple of times so I could take in all that is on offer to see. Great
,,Nice view...,3.0,,"The cable car leaves mount Faber and goes across to Sentosa. I must say I do struggle a little with the artificial feel of Sentosa, its seems a little infantile. However the cable car was timely, relaxing and the children liked it."
,,A must do in Singapore,5.0,,"Great views, and excellent photo opportunities. The staff are friendly and helpful. A must do when in Singapore."
,,Good ride and good view,3.0,,"The ride wasn't bad. It's really high, and you get to Sentosa easily. It can get really hot inside of those cabins so I wouldn't advise it if it's a sunny day."
,,Good view of Island,4.0,,"It was pretty much what you would expect it to be, Hop on and off if you have booked the round trip $33 per adult at the gate, Staff very friendly, booked using govoyagin print off tickets at hotel reception (saving 33 percent which cost 80$ instead of $120 at the gate for both cables cars round trip), one going onto the mainland and the other on Santosa, you can get off and on if paying for the round trip, or go on a one way trip.
If you use govoyagin, ask your hotel reception if you can print out there most will oblige, now that I saved there will try on the night safari and gardens by the bay, every bit helps.
Also if using govoyagin on the top of page change the money to Australian dollars and use your normal credit card as would not accept nab traveler card.
We were happily surprised that at the end of the coloured cable cars route there was a lift up to a lookout called fort siloso which also had some history on the war, all free!! Fav four letter word.I would say if your going to only choose one do the one that stays on sentosa, and explore the Island.
Happy travelling."
,,another way of getting a view of singapore,5.0,,one of the must do in singapore give a holistic view and also crossing the sea at such heights gives thrills to young and the old ones. dont miss both the day and night view
,,NOT Air conditioned and a lot higher than you think!,5.0,,"You share with up to 8 people max, not air conditioned, but cool enough on the day we travelled - great views although mount faber is in the middle of no where so had to get a taxi/uber back from there."
,,Great View of Sentosa and Harbourfront,4.0,,Buy a ticket once and ride on the cable car multiple times. We bought a ticket after we entered Sentosa and used the cable car to reach some of the attractions inside. And finally took the cable car out to exit Sentosa and got off at the Harbourfront Station. If you happen to get off at the Mount Faber station then be prepared for a climb down the hill. Harbourfront station is the most convenient place since it is very close to the MRT and bus and makes it very convenient
,,The city from the Sky,5.0,,This activity is definetely Yes. One will see the greatness of the city from above. It is a nice spot for pictures taking.
,,It's OKEY,4.0,,"The cable car is new, clean and big but sadly I was alone. I took the cable car from Sentosa and the view very nice."
,,Good views,4.0,,"My son and I were able to get discounted tickets using the HANDY phone the hotel gave us to use. We stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel on Sentosa. If you pay full price, then I do not think it is worth the price. We paid S$31 total for one adult and one child. We were able to get return tickets on both cable car lines. One takes you to Fort Siloso via Imbiah and the other line takes you across the water from Sentosa to Mount Faber, via VivoCity.

Views were fantastic as you go quite high. It did get a bit hot inside the cable car but they do have mini fans, which did a little. It is worth a visit. There is not much at Mount Faber apart from the Bell of Happiness, which isn't that exciting."
,,Scenic view,4.0,,It gives a picturesque view of the Sentosa island. You can take the tickets or buy online . Some relatable websites may even offer you a discount on online purchase .
,,new cable transport amazing very big can accomate up to 10 person.,5.0,,"very nice cabin , very big , we can eat small stacks nuts and water , we can take a lot of views , pictures ,
we can see marina bay .! ticket 25 to 40 sgd , two station , at the same time and return to garden.."
,,Great views,5.0,,"Great views of Sentosa Island, the city and port. Cafes etc at stopping points.Booked tickets via Klook for good discount. Take the Mount Faber cable to Sentosa then change to the Sentosa cable for a trip along the island and visit the sandy beach."
,,Not a must,3.0,,The ride was good and views nice. Inside no aircon a bit discomforting.on top really nothing to see and to do.A bit expensive.
,,Excellent Ride & Views,4.0,,"We took the Singapore Cable Car to Sentosa Island from the Mount Faber station. The views are fantastic and the ride very smooth. The route takes you through the top of an office block and, when we were there, over the top of a cruise liner.

We booked our tickets through the hotel and got them almost half price - full price is S$33 per adult which includes access to the Sentosa Cable Car when you're on the island. To get up to the Faber Mount Station we took a taxi which was by far the easiest unless you're on an organised tour.

Coming back we jumped off at the Waterfront Station as theres a taxi rank at the bottom - we thought it would be difficult back at the Mount Faber Station as theres no rank.

Definately high on the list of must do's if visiting Singapore."
,,Great way to get to Sentosa,5.0,,This is the best and most spectacular way to get to Sentosa Island Again the views are stunning and you get a feel of the massive water traffic that comes into Singapore There is a cost of return trip
,,Great to way travel to sentosa,4.0,,"Best way to have a scenic sky view while going to Sentosa. It's best to book in advance. You can get a free bus ride to any location in Sentosa. The Sentosa Cable car station also has some nice cafes, starbucks, subway etc & small adventure rides."
,,Brilliant views over the city,5.0,,We used the cable car to go to Universal Studios. Very easy to use and stunning views over the city. A must for anyone wanting to go to Sentosa Island
,,Singapore Cable car,5.0,,"Absolute must when visting Singpore. View is great, cars are clean and service is great. Tip go early as no queues opens 8.40 an not many people there at that time. Starts getting really busy 10 is."
,,It was fun.,5.0,,Interesting with great views of the city. Don't go if you don't like heights. Also try not to go on a windy day.
,,Nice,4.0,,"If you haven't done it before...then you must try. Nice way to get to Samoza island. However when you get to the island, it was not easy finding the way to universal studios, you will need to ask which bus"
,,Nice view,5.0,,We did this and have no regrets spending on this. We used it to move around sentosa too. Kids loved it.
,,Super Views and Stops,4.0,,"We had seen the main Singapore attractions before embarking on a cruise. Back for a stopover, we took the cable car up to Mount Faber for the highest views, then back right over our ship to Sentosa Island. There were pleasing and sometimes surprising views all along the routes. We got off at stops on the island for closer looks at the beach, the big Merlion, the casino and the general mall amusement area. Very enjoyable on a beautiful day."
,,A little expensive but well worth it,4.0,,We went on the cable car on the last day of our cruise and did our own thing and did not take it as an excursion. We had great views of Singapore and Sentosa Island and also had a good nature walk. We did not go on any of the the attractions on Sentosa but found that just walking round there was enough. A must do trip to do.
,,Really amazing ride,4.0,,"We took this from the park to Sentosa and back, and really, really enjoyed it. It's a long ride, and it can be a bit scary (especially if it gets stuck like it did for us, if only for a little while). I recommend parking at the park and riding in to Sentosa and then back."
,,"Nice views, but don't expect much more",3.0,,"The cable cars are a great way to get views from Mount Faber and Sentosa, but that's pretty much it. That being said, they are really great views."
,,Great views,4.0,,We got discounted tickets for the cable cars so we decided to go... that and also because we knew the views would be amazing! Taking the cables were easy ... each stop had something to do although we personally didn't stop at every one!
,,Worth a one-time experience for sure,4.0,,"Being scared of heights, I wasn't able to enjoy the view much but my wife enjoyed it and loved the ride and the view. Better options available such as the Banff National Park Gondola Ride and one in India too, but every city looks different from a higher altitude, which makes such rides worth going once.

The Singapore Cable Car rides have Two-way tickets which one can utilize for going to Sentosa early in the morning and return late night to see the view in Day-time as well as night-time."
,,It gets you there,3.0,,"Great view (albeit short) and quick to get to the island and back, but just a quick cable car ride. The island is extremely touristy, just keep that in mind"
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,Its close to 30 min ride. It goes very slowly and no need to be scared of the heights. There is proper seating arrangements as well in side each sir conditioned cable car. You can see entire Singapore from the cable car. You can also watch some places of Malaysia and an island of Indonesia if isn't too cloudy. My family enjoyed a lot and you can take pictures from the car too.
,,Great,5.0,,Really enjoyed this ride across to Sentosa. We had a great day travelling around this fun place. Would recommend!!
,,Excellent views.,5.0,,Took the cable car from Sentosa Island and the ride was very smooth. The views are amazing and very romantic.

,,Nice sea view,5.0,,We have used this cable car in sentosa. The sea view from cable car is so beautiful. Actually it's our first experience.
,,Very cool,5.0,,Caught train to Harbourfront and walked to the Cable Station. Certainly gives you a exhilarating perspective of Singapore from the air! $31 return is a reasonable price.
,,A lovely relaxing way to see the views.,4.0,,"When we arrived to use the cable cars, the first part of the trip that takes you down to the beach and shore was not in operation due to updates and repairs. However, they had coaches that took you down to the beach area and from there you could go on the cable cars and enjoy the view from there. Easy to use and easy to embark and disembark from the cable cars. The staff are very helpful and the cable cars and cable car stations are very bright and clean."
,,Spectacular views,5.0,,"This is a must do, start at Mt Faber. Great views,all staff very helpful. Starts early and runs all day, don't go back to Mt Faber after 5 otherwise you'll wait hours for a taxi. Catch monorail to Sentosa entry then cab back to accomodation"
,,Brilliant,5.0,,Great views of Singapore and waters around. Buy the $34 ticket that gets you around twice and entry to Sentosa. Get off at Faber for view and walk round gardens. On Sentosa car get off at either end for the Lion and Siloso beach. Great.
,,Soaring in the skies,5.0,,"What a way to travel over the water to sentosa island. Quick, safe and reasonably prices you will be transported by this cable cart with exceptional views. A must do in Singapore"
,,Good sky view of Singapore,5.0,,There are two cable line (one for city to Sentosa and another for cable within Sentosa island). Recommend to buy cable car sky pass which can be used for both lines. Amazing views above Singapore. Online offer better deal for ticket.
,,Glad we did it,5.0,,Was a last minute decision to use the cable car to get across to Sentosa but glad we did it. Some great views of the Harbourfront area and Sentosa. Expecting long queues as it was weekend when we used it but hardly any waiting for cars.
,,We used the cable car ride one way from faber park to the sentosa.,4.0,,It is recommended that one takes this cable car ride at least one way for it offers a fantastic view of the Sentosa Island and the Singapore Bay.
,,"""A must see and do""",5.0,,"The sights from the cable car are awesome. It's a great ride. We took the Sky Cable Car dining experience for our Wedding Anniversary dinner. the food and the wine were first class and the service friendly and efficient. We would highly recommend this experience. Chris & Maria, Australia"
,,Great experience and lovely views,4.0,,We used the Cable car to go from Sentosa to Faber Mt to walk the Southern Ridges and then return. Great views and relatively cheap ($30.00) return per person. Cable cars are clean and easy to look out of. Good facilities at Faber Mountain.
,,Long queues and very crowded.,5.0,,"We had to be in queue for almost 45 minutes to get in to cable car. One we inside we loved this, children’s were very excited , it is almost 20 mins ride"
,,High above held by a string you see the world around,4.0,,"The cable experience is awesome. It starts from Harbor Front 15th floor. You shall be surprised to note that the cable car is boarded from the 15th floor (exact floor may be different) of a building. One takes an escalator to board the cable car.

The capsule of the cable car can easily house 4-6 people; but the operators give all privacy to visitors by housing them to independent capsule on basis of their own company. Maybe that during huge visitor traffic they alter their practice.

The cable moves above the sea line that differentiates the Singapore from Sentosa island. The cable starts rising high while crossing the water beneath. You shall sight yachts, steamers in the waters below. One shall sight the approaching Sentosa island and the Singapore left behind. The Sentosa island is housed with several attractions and resorts. From that height one is able to see the top surface of most of the attractions. The journey is small but interesting.

Now, I must make the most important fact. While returning back by the same cable car do not disembark at the Harbor front point wherefrom you had embarked the cable. Keep sitting and inform the staff their that we want to see Mount Faber point. No extra amount is charged for this additional trip. They shall allow you to continue beyond and within minutes your journey explores an extension towards Mount Faber. It is a high spot encircled with many trees. It has a small shop and an open restaurant. You can spend some time over there and then return back by embarking the cable once again.

The journey shall conclude at the same place where you had started from. Good experience indeed."
,,"Nice views, money well spent",5.0,,"This is a good way to get into Sentosa. The views from Mt. Faber to Sentosa is really good.......with the ocean, cruise liners below etc adding to the the experience. We took it one way, but used the Monorail and MRT on our way back."
,,Neat views,4.0,,"A good experience, some great views from the Mount Faber line and the Sentosa line. A neat experience."
,,Great views.,4.0,,"This is a nice way to see some of the views of Singapore while on the way to Sentosa Island. We ended up doing this trip both ways, then went back another day and took the monorail one way and cable car again the other. Purchasing the return trip is best value."
,,VERY GOOD,4.0,,"Ride a cable car goes to sentosa island, that is must to do if you want to see good view from sky.
One cable car is enough for 4 person, but we are lucky because only both of us when we ride there.
Little bit expensive, but very worthed with view we get from sky."
,,Must do in Singapore,5.0,,Some amazing views on both the lines of this Cable Car! One of the Santosa visits (maybe Acquarium day) should be done by this CC.
,,not too shaky wonderful views,4.0,,wenton round trip as no time to stop at sentosa but better value to go to sentosa went over it in cable car lots to see in park for families
,,Great Ride and Views,4.0,,"This is a must do while in Singapore, and to get over to the Island of Sentosa. If you buy a complete round trip then you can ride the other 2 cable cars on the island."
,,Must do!,5.0,,"Ride a Cable car from Vivo centre to Faber peak and then to Sentosa Island, Amazing views, well worth it!!!"
,,View,4.0,,"It is a fantastic view, we take this ride after 6pm when the ticket price whas cheaper and we have a fantastic view over the sunset, and a round the islands."
,,Nice,4.0,,Got to see a lot of the waterfront. It goes from the mainland to Sentosa Island. Took a lot of pictures.
,,Ok.,4.0,,Simple cable car to take you from the Mount Faber Park to Sentosa Island. Nice view. Use it only once and then come back with free tram from Sentosa to the city.
,,never miss it,5.0,,"its one of the main attraction never miss it ,all the place you see in the cable car is worth ,you can see only from this ,must try"
,,Fantastic Cable Car,5.0,,"The Singapore Cable car has been an institution for a long time, well since my first crossing in 2009 anyway. So on this visit and a trip down memory lane we just had to make the crossing to Sentosa again. The staff servicing the cable are are friendly, the service is efficient and is a great relaxing way to get to Sentosa. We booked online seamlessly and surprised that the prices are still great value."
,,For the breathtaking views!,4.0,,"Easy to enter and easy to exit. As a person who has fear of height,I thought i would'nt enjoy but oh boy i was surprized! Must vsit"
,,Love iT!,5.0,,"Attractive, fun, clean and superb view. A MUST! The only downside is the relatively pricey tickets for such a short period of time."
,,Scared the crap out of me,3.0,,It was ok and fairly safe but I hate heights. I don't recommend it if you hate heights. But I guess it's ok.
,,Exciting.,4.0,,"This is another must whilst visiting Singapore, the views are incredible, we travelled from the station on Faber mountain to Sentosa then back to Harbour side. Again great friendly staff. Would recommend this experience. Peter B."
,,A different view of Singapore,4.0,,Just another cable car but the views are great. You can see back to the city as well as seeing Santosa in full view.
,,Santosa is a must,4.0,,"A lovely island that is worth a look. We took the cable car over, and did the length of the island on the one that operates there. Also took the bus island tour and saw how the other half live. Great beaches, excellent views and even cool beach bars. Give it a go, you won't regret it."
,,Wow,5.0,,"Do it, what a way to travel over to Sentosa Island. Costs 33SD each return and you can also use the cable car on Santosa as part of price. spectacular views and great for your snaps"
,,"Nice cable car, with good view.",4.0,,"The cable cars offer an easy access to Mount Faber/Faber point, as well a a mode of transportation to Sentosa Island.
Unfortunately the secondary line that goes across Sentosa island in east-western direction was being services when I visited. So I only tried the Mount Faber - Harbourfront - Siloso Point (and back) routes.
I visited on a weekday outside holiday, and had no problems getting a car immediately (no waiting time at all). I am not sure how busy the cars are in high season and/or weekends.
I would definitely recommend trying the cable car if you want an quick birds eye perspective on Sentosa/Mount Faber area.
I would probably visit again."
,,Not a mode of transport,3.0,,Normally cable cars are for the places where there is no easy access for other mode of transport. But Singapore cable cars is just for tourist attraction where we can easily go to Santosa with Car or Train. But view from Cable Cars is nice and if you take around 8 PM you can see firework from water fountain show.
,,Fantastic activity in Santosa,5.0,,"It is one of the most attractive activity in Santosa. i was literally astonished by the way they operate these cable car. Good view, clean cabins. easy for transport inside santosa."
,,Cable Car,5.0,,We went on the Cablecar to Sentosa island and combined it with an Aquarium ticket which was very good a little on the pricey side however well worth it. Universal Studios is also on Sentosa Island cable car is a great way to get there plus you get amazing views.
,,Avoid lines and take the cable car to Sentosa Island,5.0,,"If you are riding the cable car, you are likely going to Sentosa Island. You could get their by tram or bus for a little less money but you have to fight the crowds. Take the cable car, enjoy the view and avoid the crowds. The cable cars move fast and efficiently.

As you know, you can run into an afternoon shower in Singapore. We were just getting ready to leave when the rain shower started. I saw a huge line forming and asked what it was for. They said people were trying to get on the tram to exit the park. We navigated our way to the cable car, waited 5 minutes and were on our way."
,,Cool Heights!,5.0,,"This is a great way of seeing Singapore from a different aspect. Looking down over visiting cruise ships was fascinating! Although we were not into the family delights which Sentosa has to offer, it was pleasant to stroll and paddle along the beach at Silosa, watching (and hearing!) people whizzing down the zip wire. Mount Faber was not as lofty as expected but worth the trip for good views and lovely spot for coffee, a beer or snack!
The cable car ride was a memorable experience on our second Singapore stay and one I would recommend."
,,Awesome trip and great views,5.0,,"I purchased a unlimited day pass, and just loved the cable car, the view is great, would have been better on a non hazy day but still worth the trip. going over the top of some cruise ships was great and at the top of Faber Peak the view is good but some parts obstructed by the trees"
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Our taxi driver recommended us to go via Cable Car (of course that was more for his fare and we bought the tickets from a booth that his relative probably owned) but all was above board and the price of the tickets and to the S.E.A. Aquarium that we purchased via the Taxi driver were all the same price as on line so - all good there!! We probably wouldn't have taken the cable car unless he suggested it and it was fabulous, great modern cars, wonderfully friendly staff and all stations. Fabulous views - couldn't ask for more than that for our first day in Singapore. Thoroughly enjoyed it."
,,short ride and expensive!,3.0,,"If you're going to Sentosa, the cable car is one of the many options yet most expensive. TWO cable car lines that connect TWO locations – Sentosa and Faber Peak Singapore. We decided to ride the cable car to see Singapore from above, capture photos beyond and able to see it in different angels.

We were only interested to go to Mount Fabre but the ticket was also valid for Sentosa. the ride was short and not a fun ride. The cable car in Hong Kong to ngong ping village hong kong way a lot better. When we reach yo Mount Faber Peak we were not impress it wasn't worthy. When you reached to the peak you can see a lot, we spent 10-15mins and headback...

The only thing we enjoyed during the ride when we passed the Harbour. The visibility was poor and totally Overpriced!!! it was a good day but doesn't meet our expectations!"
,,Great Experience,5.0,,"I used this cable instead of boat trip, this cable car giving amazing experience better than other option.Travelling over water super excited."
,,Overpriced,3.0,,"Nice views of the bay, but expensive think it was $28 return ticket from Harbour Front to Sentosa, worth doing once to tick off your bucket list."
,,Trip to Universal Studios,4.0,,We just wanted to travel to Universal Studios - in the end the trip on the Cable Car was more expensive than entry in Universal Studios. There is a very long walk to the Studios after the Cable Car trip. The Cable Car trip was very good but it is very confusing.
,,enjoyed the cable car,5.0,,This a very good trip. I love Singapore and would go every year as there is so much to see. And it is a very friendly place. I also love to see all the orchards.
,,Three night stay in Singapore,5.0,,Its worth seeing the view when leaving or heading over to Sentosa. Not a long ride if you are not keen on heights. As always anything in Singapore works well and is clean.
,,It's beautiful to enjoy during the day,3.0,,"You can capture the full city and the Island Sentosa from this Cable car. It's a bit expensive, i felt though considering the short length of the trip. good to go in Groups/couples."
,,Not sure of safety,3.0,,We went across on the cable car and had no trouble but we were told there as been a few accidents and people have been killed but they seem confident that they have sorted problems and everything is safe
,,Sentosa Line to go around the island,4.0,,"If you're visiting Sentosa for the day, definitely get the round trip pass. It gives you a great view of the island and also is a convenient way to go around. Plan your itinerary wisely if you'll just get a roundtrip."
,,Visit to Sentosa,5.0,,"Need to pick a time as early and late there are long queues. Well organised but no discounts unless you have a resident card.
Not well placed for taxis. Arriving is Ok but returning by cab is spasmodic. MTR is at an intermediate station not the main end of line station. easy embarkation and disembarkation from cars, and spectacular views across the city on route."
,,Value for money,5.0,,"Magnificent views, comfortable ride. Photographer waiting at first stop . Good value for money. The queue flows quite quickly"
,,Scenic,4.0,,A way to see this part of the city in a very different but very nice way. Lovely and very scenic views. Expensive but worth it
,,Very very high up ...,5.0,,"If you have any, the try to suppress your fear of heights. It is of course very safe and the longe ride is amassing. You will have views over the city from several angles and if you chose to also take the Samosa line (that is recommended) then you vil have one of the best views of the island, is beaches and the amazing lign-up of ships for the singapore harbour. We didn't stay long time on Samosa but you might. Both setups are easily doable with the thicket setup available. There is a bit of a walk from the MRT station but good signing to guide you."
,,Breathtaking views and value for money,5.0,,"Recent visit to Singapore with family in March 2017. Simply amazing experience and worth spending tickets and we wanted to do it again & again. Best of to take cable car from Faber Peak only as you can view best of Singapore, worth the time and money. And take return pass ONLY SGD 33 adult (per person) return pass as that way you can come back at the same place and would not regret. Also, this includes another cable car trip within Sentosa island covering 3 more stops. Family loved it and cant get over it."
,,Loved the views..& convenient transport!!!,5.0,,"The cable car is a great way to access Sentosa & Faber Peak, Bought return ticket and found it bit expensive but worth doing it. It offers amazing views of Singapore and if there is a cruise ship in port, you will most likely find yourself travelling straight over the top of it. This is not for the faint-hearted though, as it is quite high up. When returning at night it can be even scarier. Especially as all the windows were open and there was quite a wind so the car was blowing around quite a lot."
,,Very nice,4.0,,"nice nice view ... over the harbout overlooking the port, cruise center and into the sentosa world universal studios ...we did this after our langkawi tour-so this was a second experience for us on a sky cab :)"
,,Lovely,5.0,,"Great attraction, beautiful birds eye view, great for photographs and take the No1 or No2 free bus around the island, it's a hop on hop off bus, about 40 mins round trip"
,,Good way to get to Sentosa and Mount Faber,4.0,,We enjoyed the cable car ride. On a warm day it can get quite warm and stuffy in the cable car as they only have fans. Great views
,,Alternative transfortation,4.0,,"It so excited to go with skyway or cable car, I have tried to go with this from sentosa island to the city even my colleague feel little bit afraid. I can enjoy the view from the height, no interfence and remarkable, so you should be try it guys.."
,,Great fun and useful transport,5.0,,This is an excellent attraction and also a convenient transport to get to Sentosa and Faber Peak. I am very used to skiing lifts and it was a good fun to share the cabin with people who have taken their first ride in the cable car.
,,Great impression of the city,5.0,,Not for the feint hearted as it is so very high but gives you a great view of the place. Attendants let us ride by ourselves in an empty cab so plenty room to take pics and appreciate the views.
,,Great trip to Sentosa but not for the faint-hearted,4.0,,"The cable car is a great way to access Sentosa, although look for discount ticketing as it can be expensive to buy the return trip. It offers amazing views of Singapore and if there is a cruise ship in port, you will most likely find yourself travelling straight over the top of it. This is not for the faint-hearted though, as it is quite high up. When returning at night it can be even scarier. Especially as all the windows were open and there was quite a wind so the car was blowing around quite a lot."
,,a must do,5.0,,"Glide over sky line fantastic views, visit sentosa beach but you can just stay on the car and expereince amazing views well thought out easy to use, friendly helpful staff"
,,Nice cable car ride,5.0,,"We took the cable car all the way to Santosa Island. We purchase the tickets round trip so to enjoy the cable car.The ride was smooth, amazing view and we took it to different stops in Santosa.A big pricey about $58 per person.Clean inside and new cars and not lineup either way.Take your camera"
,,Very High!,5.0,,The gondola gives you incredible views over the docks and beaches. If you have vertigo though not recommended as it climbs incredibly high! Would recommend it though.
,,A good view,5.0,,We went on this to get to Universal Studios . It was a short trip but worth the ride. Try and go when its not raining.
,,Singapore harbour and Sentosa from a different perspective,4.0,,A great view and peaceful way to see a different perspective of the massive operations that are Sentosa Island and the harbour. If you don't like heights or potential winds moving the gondola you might think twice but having no such issues I enjoyed the experience
,,What a view,5.0,,If you want to visit Sentosa Island then the cable car from Mount Faber is the way to go. Easy to navigate your way to the ride and very beautiful views of Singapore
,,Relaxing ride,5.0,,We hopped on the cable car at Mount Faber and jumped off at Harbour station. After visiting Vivo City we caught the cable car and did another loop up to Mount Faber and then over to Sentosa. Well worth the money and a relaxing ride.
,,dont miss this,5.0,,A great view of the Santos and we could see other lands of Malaysia and Indonesia as it was a very clear day. We took mulitiple trips for very little extra cost.
,,good,4.0,,"took cable car from Faber Mountain to Sentosa all good but its a funny feeling travelling over buildings and ships, after a few minutes all Ok if you don't like heights, smooth trip thankfully"
,,The best place for photographer,5.0,,"I travelled to Singapore many times to take photographs of the city.
I took many pictures of the city from Marina Bay Sands skypark, the Singapore flyer, the Merlion and Tiger Sky Tower but there was no place better than the Cable Car. The city and the harbour view from the cable car was marvellous and the ride was very comfortable. The cable car was very slow so I had enough time to take the best view of every corner of the city. You could always do the roundabout trip if you missed one shot. I took a daytime ride from Harbourfront to Sentosa Island and the experience was fantastic. I could hardly imagine the view of scenery at night. I plan to take a roundabout ride with my wife at night to celebrate our wedding anniversary and it would be quite romantic."
,,Best way to see Sentosa,5.0,,"I am a 'frequent flyer' on the Singapore Cable Car, thanks to its attractive and affordable annual membership package. I would say that a ride on the Cable Car is a very enjoyable experience-- soaring hundreds of metres above with a very scenic view of the Keppel Harbour and Sentosa itself.

The Cable Car actually has two separate lines- Mount Faber Line running between Sentosa Island and mainland Singapore, and Sentosa Line that runs within the island. I would recommend that you buy the $33 (adult) / $22 (child) Sky Pass, which allows you one full loop each on both lines. If you want more, you could top up $1 for one additional loop or $10 for unlimited rides until the end of the day. Do note that if you wish to top up, it must be made at the time where you bought your ticket. You cannot top up additional rides after you have bought the Sky Pass.

I will usually take the Cable Car at Mount Faber Line's HarbourFront station. HarbourFront Cable Car station is located at Level 15 of HarbourFront Tower 2, a 16-storey building. From HarbourFront, take Exit B (use the ticket gates located between the North East Line and Circle Line escalators as they were less crowded and nearer to that exit) that leads you to ground floor of the HarbourFront Centre. From there I would take the escalator up to Level 2 and exit by the side entrance beside KFC. Walk straight and take the escalator down to ground floor again. Walk straight along the corridor until you walk past a real estate showroom and a chiropractic clinic. From there, turn left and walk to the back (by this time you should be able to see the cable cars right above you) until you reach a glass sliding door that says ""South Entrance"". That would be the entrance to HarbourFront Cable Car station.

At HarbourFront Cable Car station (an intermediate station between Mount Faber and Sentosa), I would usually take the cable car towards Mount Faber as they tend to be less crowded during the weekends -- Most people start and end their journey at HarbourFront, and will therefore alight at the ""platform"" where you will board the cable car.

From HarbourFront to Mount Faber, the cable car takes you high above Telok Blangah Road and West Coast Highway viaduct, a spectacular sight when there is traffic. Slightly up the route, you will get to see buses entering and exiting HarbourFront Bus Terminal located on the other side of Telok Blangah Road. The cable car then takes you up the slopes of Mount Faber to the cable car's terminus at Faber Peak.

Mount Faber station is located on the upper floor of Faber Peak, an elegant hilltop building with a souvenir shop, alfresco restaurants, and a ballroom. There is generally nothing much to see around Mount Faber, but you can enjoy a panoramic view of the Central Business District, Keppel Harbour, and even as far as the docks at Pasir Panjang. If you wish to venture further, you can take a 15-20 minutes walk down the hill to Henderson Waves, a large and magnificently designed pedestrian bridge high above a busy road. For the adventurous ones, beyond Henderson Waves you can take a 10km hike that takes you through the Southern Ridges to Kent Ridge (5 MRT stops away!).

From HarbourFront to Sentosa, you will soar high above the Keppel Harbour where you will get to see Batam ferries entering or leaving the ferry pier. If you are lucky, you can see one or two cruise ships docked at the Singapore Cruise Terminal. Moments later, you will find yourself soaring high above Adventure Cove Waterpark, with people splashing around the two waterslide features and the wave pool. If you look towards your left (facing forward), you will get to see some of the Universal Studios Singapore's attractions (most notably the Far Far Away Castle and Battlestar Galatica's twin roller coasters.

Sentosa cable car station is located at the centre of Imbiah Lookout where many of Sentosa's attractions are located -- Skyline Luge, Images of Singapore, Madame Tussauds Singapore, 4D Adventureland, etc. The station building itself has a Cable Car Souvenir Shop, a cable car museum (closed for renovations as of end Feb 2017), a Subway food outlet, and Sentosa ticketing counters where you can buy tickets for almost all attractions within the island.

To change to Sentosa cable car line, turn right after exiting the souvenir shop and head downhill (you will walk past the ticket counters and Subway). Continue downhill until you see a zebra crossing that leads you to Sentosa Line's Imbiah station.

Imbiah station is an intermediate station between Sentosa Line's terminals, Merlion and Siloso Point. I would recommend taking the cable car towards Siloso Point as the Imbiah-Siloso Point stretch is significantly longer than the Imbiah-Merlion stretch. Towards Siloso Point, the cable car will take you high above Mount Imbiah's jungle (part of Sentosa Nature Discovery). En route, you will see MegaZip Adventure Park at the top of Mount Imbiah, complete with three flying fox ropes that run all the way to an islet off Siloso Beach.

At Siloso Point station, there is a 7-Eleven and a coconut ice cream store. Attractions around the station include Fort Siloso Skywalk (an 11-storey open walkway), Fort Siloso, Rasa Sentosa Resort, and the western end of Siloso Beach. From Siloso Point station, you can change to Sentosa's free shuttle bus and Beach Tram, both of which have stops located within the station's vicinity.

From Imbiah to Merlion station, the cable car runs steeply downhill, flying directly above Skyline Luge's tracks and the Skylift. Merlion station is located at Merlion Park, directly opposite Sentosa Express' Imbiah station. From Merlion, you can visit the largest (and only) attraction in the area, Sentosa Merlion. Alternatively, you can take a leisurely stroll along the walkway to Resorts World Sentosa or to the beaches.

Here are some tips on visiting Singapore Cable Car:

- Cable car cabins can get quite warm on sunny days. Mount Faber Line's cable car cabins are fitted with two small PC fans and has a roof window that allows better ventilation. The windiest sections on the Cable Car are between HarbourFront and Sentosa on the Mount Faber LIne and between Imbiah and Siloso Point on the Sentosa Line.

- If it rains, try not to close all the windows as the cabin interior can get stuffy and warm real fast. Open the windows a little (for Mount Faber Line, just keep the roof window closed) so that some air gets into the cabin.

- All cabin windows are tinted, so you may want to try taking pictures at the door if you are particular about lighting. Cabin interiors on Sentosa Line are slightly brighter than the ones on Mount Faber Line.

- The cabins are dimly lit at night (two small LEDs).

- Consider topping up $10 for the unlimited rides option so that you can utilise the cable car as a mode of transport within the island. Shuttle buses in Sentosa have long waiting times (and they get crowded at times), and Sentosa Express has, honestly, a limited coverage within Sentosa, and can get very crowded at times.

- Try to avoid weekend late mornings and afternoons as the Mount Faber Line can get quite crowded, especially at Mount Faber and HarbourFront (towards Sentosa) stations. If you are a solo rider or your group is small (2-3 people), there is a very high chance that you will need to share cabin with another solo rider or small group during these hours.

- Waiting times at Mount Faber may be longer during busy periods as they will usually leave every other cabin empty so that more people can board at HarbourFront.

- Lifts at Sentosa Line stations are reserved for the pregnant, elderly, handicapped, and prams only. The main boarding line runs all the way to the escalators, not the lifts.

- If you want to re-board the cable car at any of the four terminal stations, you must line up again at the boarding line as the alighting and boarding areas are separated."
,,good ride for good fotos,5.0,,"found it very safe, clean, interesting & absolutely great for taking pictures from the very top. used it to get to the Universal park"
,,Good to go on after cruise!,4.0,,We caught the cable car across to Sentosa Island after our cruise as we arrived early morning. Left our luggage at the cruise terminal for the day (luggage services L2). We purchased a round ticket with entry to Aquarium and Madame Tussauds which was good value.
,,Really fun experience,4.0,,"We purchased combined Mt Faber and Sentosa Island tickets for $33 each. We went from Mt Faber to Sentosa and then did the Sentosa line both ways getting of at each end of the line to explore. Then back to the central point and on to the Mt Faber line to get off at Harbour Front.

From our hotel Marina Bay Sands to Mt Faber was $9 by taxi and back from the Harbour Front $7 so not really worth messing about with public transport.

We travelled on Saturday from 9 to 12 and had each car to ourselves but it was getting busy around 12 as we were returning.

The final tower before the Sentosa Island dock is Really high so if you do not like hights !!"
,,a lovely wat to visit Sentosa Island,5.0,,We took 2 cable cars to the island and it is a great way to see the scenery and observe the changing face of Singapore well worth a visit
,,Fantastic Views,5.0,,We took the cable car from the mainland over to Sentosa Island. The views are amazing. My son loved it. It's a nice relaxing way for tourists to get a great view of the city.
,,Terrific views,5.0,,"Lovely view of the island, Sentosa Island and lots to do at the stops. Went to Fort Siloso for WWII history. Got off at Imbiah Lookout for the Sentosa Merlion and another outstanding view. Madame Tussauds is also at Imbiah Lookout for an interesting few hours of interactive looking. The Tiger Tower again gives an amazing view. Lots of fun at 4D Adventure park."
,,eye in the sky,5.0,,the Singapore cable car experience is a true eye in the sky it offers the visitor the opportunity to see the city from the lofty height of the cable car and absorb the beauty from high above
,,Great view.,4.0,,"This was a great way to get to Sentosa, giving you lots of view's of the bay, it was safe & enjoyable."
,,Stunning views of Singapore city to Sentosa Island.,4.0,,"Reasonable cost for a return journey on this cable car service. We really enjoyed this short, safe ride to Sentosa Island & back later in the day. Great attraction in Singapore city!"
,,Fun!,5.0,,"If you don't like cable cars, don't think this one will change your mind. It was swinging in the wind a little for us, which made me nervous, but of course it will. But if you DO like them, you'll love this, for the comfort and the views. We got a Cable Car/Universal ticket which included unlimited cable car rides, so we went to Fort Siloso as well. Good day all around."
,,best scenery of keppel - sea,5.0,,"cable car trips best to view all good taking photos , go to mt faber , another view gallery , and others that will not regret"
,,Great views!,5.0,,Excellent means of getting from Mount Faber to Sentosa Island. Fantastic views and a fun ride. Great photographic opportunity. On return journey get off at Harbourfront rather than back to Mount Faber for something different.
,,"Fun, but be ready to wait!",4.0,,"This is a fun way to get over to Sentosa, just be prepared to wait in long lines to get on! They were allowing huge tour groups to get on also, and it would take them a long time. They only allow 8 people to one cable car."
,,"Well worth a ride, but confusing pricing",4.0,,"One of the many 'toursity' things to do in Singapore is to ride the cable car.

Our trip took us from Harbourside (only a few minutes walk from the MRT stop of the same name) over the Santosa.

We visited on a quiet day, so were grateful to have a car to ourselves and took many photos as we enjoyed the views out into the harbour and back of the city.

While the ride is great fun and highly recommended, the pricing structure and inclusions are a bit confusing.

With the cable car servicing a number of destinations, and some tickets including entry to some attractions, I'd recommend doing your ticket type research on the website before you head off for the day."
,,Good Views,5.0,,"Try to get an all day package so that you have unlimited use of the cars, go early to avoid crowds. Make sure you pack water a hat and sunscreen."
,,Great experience,5.0,,"My partner loved this aerial experience .... she giggled and shrieked her excitement, I have done this before and it was her first try .... loved it and everyone must do it if visiting Sentosa!"
,,What a View,5.0,,"Took the cable car ride from Faber Peak to Sentosa Island. What lively views of all parts of the city - beach, busy port, residential areas. Really enjoyed."
,,Birds eye view of the port and Sentoasa Island,5.0,,"Sentosa cables cars good, however Sentosa Island and children orientated, however adults would find Fort Silso and tree top walk of interest and worth doing"
,,Too enjoyable,5.0,,"Spacious cable car, travelled in both the routes. Travelled to Sentosa, IMBIAH in day time and came back in the night. enjoyed the spectacular views both during day and night time. A must option for anyone visiting Sentosa."
,,WONDER CAR,5.0,,"Wonderful & thrilling experience,really superb cable car, one has to experience at least once a life time."
,,High in the Sky,5.0,,"We took a taxi from Singapore to Mt Faber then got an all day pass for the Singapore Cable Sky Network $33. This allowed us to use the Sentosa Line as well. We got off at Sentosa and got on the Cable Car to Siloso Point Station. We then got back on the line and travelled to Merlion Station and visited this area (Universal Studios) before getting back on travelling to Sentosa Station, then changed to the Singapore Cable Car getting off at Harbourfront Station where we got a taxi back to Singapore. This is a great way to see Sentosa and Singapore and very good value. Cars come every five minutes."
,,Cable car ride is excellent,5.0,,The view from it either on day or night is great.. after you get down at Mount Faber it's nice to go around ... it's the highest point in Singapore so you can see almost all places from there.
,,Very nice connection to Sentosa,5.0,,You really try Cable car to an artificially created beach Sentosa. The view is undescribable. There is good choise of restaurants and bars. Simply the romantic place and lots of fun.
,,Great view,4.0,,"The lines were a bit too much, but it was worth it in the end because of the view. You rarely see Singapore from this angle. It's really beautiful to see Sentosa and the mountain leading to it in such a wonderful way. Highly recommended, but leave time for queuing."
,,holiday,4.0,,that was so good We went across to Santona Island View was fantastic and even tho it was a bit windy felt quite safe in our little bubble
,,What views,5.0,,"Great way to get to Sentosa Island and Vivo shopping centre.
The views are sensational, you virtually get 360 degree views all around you.Did not think it was too expensive but what a great way to travel.
It is a very good way to see Singapore from the air."
,,A view from the top,3.0,,"Ride the cable cars for great views of the city. Stop and have a meal or drink. Very commercial, but fun none the less."
,,THIS IS A MUST,5.0,,"Found this by chance,,,very very good value,,scenary was amazing,,,so so much to do there, to be honest, you need a whole day there.."
,,Cable car for sentosa island or hotels inside sentosa,5.0,,"It is basically a cable car to get into sentosa island . it is one of the way to reach sentosa . best way to get into sentosa is by cable car . Views from cable car is memorable.
I will definitely recommended for one way cable ride into sentosa."
,,Interesting ride,4.0,,The ride was enjoyable and interesting enough. The views were majestic. The time spent was worth it. A good thing to do in singapore with friends.
,,Love the views,4.0,,"If you are hanging out by the cruise ship terminal, the cable car is the best way to get to the Sentosa Island. It is not recommended for people who are afraid of heights, as the cabins hang 60 m over the sea. I recall the ticket being a bit expensive but it covers a return trip from the middle station, to the island, back to the hills and so on. It is definitely worth it visiting the top station as well, as there are spectacular views over the city."
,,Great viewing,5.0,,Both the Faber Road and Sentosa cable car lines were enjoyable. I recommend the Sentosa Cable car as an addition to the spectacular Mount Faber cable car. Super use of time!
,,Overpriced and boring,1.0,,"We got on the cable car at Harbour front to Sentosa Island. The cable car is so far away from the city that it wasn't even worth taking a photograph. the main view is of container ships, docks and cranes. It cost around $50 dollars for the Faber Line. When you get to Sentosa there is another cable car that crosses the island for about $13 dollars which I'm sure would be far more interesting and a third of the price. On the return we stayed on the cable car to mount Faber hoping that we might get a decent view but that was worse. Trees obscured all the possible views.
I would advise you to get the free shuttle bus or the cheap monorail (about $4 I think) across the bridge to Sentosa and use the cable car on the island itself."
,,Great Views from High Above,5.0,,"We bought the Tickets to do both Cable Car Rides. I am afraid of heights but felt safe and secure inside these Cars. A great way to get over to Sentosa but be warned, Sentosa Island can take a good chunk of $ out of your pocket."
,,Singapore Cable Car,4.0,,"What a great way to see the beautiful Singapore and Sentosa Island. Start at Mt Fabre, a hidden gem and ride the Cable Car across the harbour to Sentosa Island. Once there if you haven't already pick an attraction before you arrive there is plenty to do."
,,Quite intersting,4.0,,Cable car goes to the Santosa island. It is an interesting ride as it provides a good view of Singapore in general.
,,not a must,2.0,,if you are a person who has done a cable car than this does not provide something new or exiting except that the view of the city is given to you from a height.
,,Good experience with amazing views,4.0,,A nice fun-to-try attraction on the way to sentosa. Easy accessibility to mt.faber. A good experience with great city view.
,,Smooth conenction,5.0,,This smart city urban cable car is a smooth connection from Faber Parrk to Sentosa Island to visit all its attractions.
,,It's a good experience on the cable car to get an aerial view of Sentosa island.,4.0,,"It's very safe and the cabin are new and pretty. It's a good experience but first timer with height phobia may find it scary cos the floor is made of glass as well, see through"
,,traveling in the sky,4.0,,These cable cars are very safe and easy to get to. Love the views of the island and get to see the different resorts in the areas. Singapore is just a beautiful place to visit...
,,Nice view,4.0,,"Visited Sentosa island and decided to go back to the city with cable car. Went on the ride from one side of Sentosa to another and back, then to the city.
If you have time and nothing else to do in Singapore, then its nice ride to take."
,,See the world from High !,3.0,,"Beautiful views , however nothing special , much better and more interesting things to see and do in Singapore ... I personally wouldn't recommend it .."
,,Wow,5.0,,absolutely loved the cable cars and will definitely go again ..there was amazing views and the ride so smooth and exciting
,,Great way to get to Sentosa,5.0,,The cable car is an experience in itself. So much fun and a great way to get to Sentosa and to see the island from above. The views are amazing.
,,Fun,5.0,,"We took the cable car all the way to universal studios this was really good, views were awesome some great photos from the cable car, the grand kids loved it first time in a cable car ! It's really high but must do."
,,Just OK,3.0,,"If you dont have anything else to do in Sentosa, take this ride, It will give you views of the Sentosa and Singapore from the top. Its a short ride though as it ends in like apprx 15mins"
,,Beautiful Views as Expected,4.0,,We took the stretch from Merlion station to the Imbiah Outlook station at sunset and loved it. Kids were happy with the views and the excitement of getting onto a moving cable car!
,,Great experience,5.0,,"We took the cable car to access Sentosa island. The trip was absolutely gorgeous, you will get an incredible view on Singapore and Sentosa island"
,,Treated like Royalty,5.0,,"I booked a Singapore Delights Sky Dining to celebrate my wifes birthday. I made a note on my booking that this was a special occassion. I purchased my ticket online from the Mount Faber website. My online ticket was all I needed to board the Cable Car.

When we arrived, we were asked to sit in a VIP area. We were given snacks and a juice to tide us over until our car was ready. We were escorted to our car by very friendly staff. The car was set with our meals. The big surprise was a birthday wish which was placed on my wifes desert.

The meal was outstanding and comprised seven courses of local cuisine. The best dish for me was the Wok Fried Chilli Crab Meat with Mini Mantou. We all enjoyed the Rainbow cake and had fun trying to guess the flavour of each layer. The Bandung (rose flavored milkshake) was a fantastic accompaniment to the meal.

My suggestion take the 18h00 ride as you get to do the trip twice giving you a chance to eat on the first trip and then enjoy the views in the sunset."
,,Love it,5.0,,"Frankly, I could spend half a day just riding the Cable Car back and forth. The views are quite literally spectacular, the pods themselves are clean and well maintained and the staff are ever-obliging. Our ticket also gave us access to the Sentosa Cable Car, which is just as thrilling."
,,Nice experience,5.0,,Great cable car ride from mount faber to sentosa. We enjoyed our visit here it was really enjoyable and worth avisit
,,wonderrful experience,5.0,,nice experience of passing part of a sea on cable car. It takes to Sentosa. Nice place to take selfie.
,,Beautiful Views !,5.0,,the best ways to get to sentosa which is an attraction in itself .. love my ride everytime ! Enjoyed by all age groups
,,A must if you are visiting Singapore,5.0,,You only need to do this once but make sure you do it. It forms a perfect start to the day if you are visiting Universal Studios or just the Island. You can walk back over the causeway when you have finished for th eday
,,Fantastic views,5.0,,Bought an inclusive ticket that allowed one trip on each of the lines. Views are spectacular. Got caught in a squall while in the cable car which was interesting. The cable car museum is included in the price and worth stopping off for.
,,A must do experience,5.0,,The cable is high over the ocean from Singapore to Sentosa. A return trip around $33. It is safe. Great views all around. Don't look down if you are scared of heights.
,,Very nice view,4.0,,Singapore cable car is good transportation to get the sentosa island. We can see the top view of sentosa island and Singapore ship yard. You can buy the unlimited cable ride ticket and ride unlimited. The views are very nice.
,,Enjoyable with great views,5.0,,"While at Singapore one must take the Cable car rides. In one ticket you get TWO LINES, the Sentosa and the Faber Peak. The views from both the lines are awesome.Views of the forests below and the harbor at the same time. Seating is nice and comfortable. If you take the cable ride you do not have to pay for the Sentosa Island admission also as you are already in it. A good saving of S$8.00 per person."
,,Cable Car,5.0,,what a great experience to get to Santosa Island. A short ride to Mt Faber then a gentle cable car ride to the Island.
,,Breezy sky ride to enjoy a lovely sunset!,5.0,,"For those afraid of heights, this is a great option of being cocooned in a bubble cabin and still enjoying the thrill of being up high in the sky! Haven't been on it for years and it still brought on a kiddish smile on my face, when we rode it with family visiting from abroad. The Singapore port as changed and you'll see lots more on the Sentosa side - buildings/ theme park, I mean. Still a fun ride for anyone visiting here. Would be better if they could lower the music in the cabin. Loved the breeze rising through from the sea below : )"
,,The best transportation to Sentosa Island,5.0,,"The best transportation tool to Sentosa Island. Quite, peaceful and gives you magical sightseeing to the skyline of both Singapore mainland and Sentosa island."
,,"Lavish way to get to Sentosa Island, Nice view of singapore from the top",3.0,,"If you really want to have an experience of seeing Singapore from a little way above while at the same time also wanting to go to Sentosa Island in a lavish way, this is your choice. Better to take it while the sun was up, though."
,,A great ride,5.0,,If you're going to Santosa Island this is one way to get there. The cable car departs from the top of a tall building and you can go up the mountain or over to the Island. We went up the mpuntain for lunch then over to the Island. Views are great and it's not that expensive.
,,Quite nice views,4.0,,"Purchased a Faber License membership to enjoy unlimited cable car rides and also pass on 50% discount to others coming with me. The views are amazing. Never actually had to line-up or share a cabin with any other people. The cable car doesn't seem to get that much attention as other cable cars in other countries, it's a shame."
,,A good fun and easy ride with great views,5.0,,"I took this ride to Faber peak. Very pleasant. Not too crowded. Great views of the city and bay. Be sure to walk around Faber peak for more city views. Cooler up there as well. Take the cable car back one stop to get a taxi, train etc."
,,Nice views but expensive,3.0,,Nice views from the cable cars as you would expect but the non-airconditioned gondolas are steaming hot in the Singapore sun and the ticket price is high compared to going to Sentosa by regular transport.
,,Beautiful view,5.0,,Excellent cable car ride from mount faber over to Santosa. Great view of the ship yard and of the cruise ships as you go over them
,,Nice Experience to Sentosa,5.0,,Definitely a great way to get over to Sentosa. I just don't know if I would come back to Sentosa. It is really no different than Atlantis or Disneyland.
,,A view above the mountains,5.0,,I like seeing the luxury ships while being carried by the cable car. It's also nice to see the mountain houses (I heard they're only for the rich and famous) hidden in the lush green trees.
,,Worth a day trip to the top of the hill and over to Sentosa...,4.0,,We took a day trip and used the cable car to get to the top of the hill Merlion Park I think it was....we then went over to Sentosa. The cable car is easily accessible by bus and we had a bit of fun...most of the travel made use of the several cable cars that are offer...
,,Get in the air,4.0,,"Cool views over SG and near islands. Its smooth, safe and stunning views will appear for you. Easy to get in and once on the main land you can make a nice hike to Hendersons bridge. Go in the air to see Singapore at its best"
,,Nice Relaxing and Great Views,4.0,,"It isn't a very long ride out to Sentosa Island, but along the way, you get great views of the island and great views of Singapore behind you."
,,Great ride,5.0,,"Awesome ride, get to see most of the island. Beautiful scenery from up high. I believe you can also pay to have dinner in these"
,,"A must for the first ti,e visitor",4.0,,Great experience. The rest of my family went to Sentosa. I returned back. You have to catch a cab to the starting point. Found it annoying at every stop the tickets being marked
,,Views of singapore,5.0,,In my opinion this is worth the money. You can use the Sentosa express for considerably less money but the views of Singapore and Sentosa from the cable car are fab! We joined at harbour front and took the lift up 15 floors to access the Mount Faber line. At the top we got off to have a look around and take pics then travelled all the way back down to Sentosa. You get a really good view of the island from the golf course to the water park. A great experience.
,,Must do,4.0,,"If you have a day and want to go to Santosa, then go to Mt Faber and take the full cable car trip. Suggest you book on line first and save upwards of 20% off the standard price."
,,Not worth the money!!!,2.0,,The over all transportation in Sentosa Island is complicated and this cable car was not working between Singapore City and Island. We had to take the Cable car within the Island and it was not worth the money.
,,Great experienced!,5.0,,Me and my friend explored Sentosa Island riding the cable car. It was a great experienced for me and my first time too. We are able to see a spectacular view of Sentosa Island while in the cable car and I think the price is reasonable and it's one of the 'must do thing' when you visit Singapore specially Universal Studio. Will do it again if any family members or friends will come and visit me!
,,Great Ride!,5.0,,"Definitely worth going for a ride! There are 2 lines, one from the mainland to Sentosa, and then one on Sentosa itself where it takes you from one end of the island to the other. We got tickets for a trip on both and it was great. Fantastic views all round the city and bay!"
,,"Great views, Great way to go to Sentosa Island",5.0,,We decided we would try the cable car to get to Sentosa Island and what a great idea it was. Amazing views coming into the island and it allowed us to see everything that we wanted to go to. Would definatly recommend taking the cable cart if you plan to visit Sentosa. Also you can buy all your passes from the one ticket office which helps with Queuing later in the day!
,,Breath Taking Views! Fast Commute,5.0,,"If you have two way ticket for the cable car, reach Harbourfront first and take cable car towards Mt. Faber. Get down and roam around Mt. Faber, see nice views from the mount peak, try your luck at the bell of happiness or coffee/food at spuds and aprons.

Later you come back to Mt. Faber station and take the cable car all the way to Sentosa. the same ticket allows you to travel on Sentosa line as well. So you can move around Merlio stations to Imbiah lookout or towards Siloso beach station as well.

Especially the views from Imbiah lookout to bech station is awesome, you see sea side for more than 180 degrees of the view on your left :)"
,,Up up and away,5.0,,"With one of us not really fan of high place or thing, this is definitely little challenging for us, but it all went well. View from above is lovely, and one of us finally tick the fear list, so that's great."
,,A Nce Experience,4.0,,With this cable car you will pass above the water. You can enjoy and take picture of Sentosa Island and Singapore Ports. It was a nice experience.
,,"Easy, Safe & Comfortable",5.0,,"We used Cable car system to get Universal Studios. Easy to navigate, really comfortable system. Nice to see around from high."
,,Different experience over the bay,4.0,,Worth to try if you are heading Sentosa island. I've been high earlier but never in cable car over the water :) You get easily a picture of Sentosa and and Singapore Ports from this point of view.
,,"Great Views, must do.",4.0,,This was another excellent experience. The trick is to some how get the glass bottom car. The experience of going over things is great. Well worth doing.
,,Great way to see the sights,5.0,,"Can be long queues to get tickets, but worth the wait, 2 lines both offer great views, everything was clean and reasonably priced"
,,Relaxing way to get over jet lag,4.0,,We just rode the two sets of cable cars. Didn't bother to see any of the sights at each stops. Very relaxing way to get over jet lag.
,,Great views,5.0,,Use the cable car across both routes - Mount Faber and Sentosa Line. Exceptional Views of blue seas... port of Singapore. There are deals to get the tickets cheaply so watch out for them. They also click your photos so if you are interested get them too.
,,great view from the top,3.0,,"you can take the cable car to visit stations in santosa only or out the island as well, it is great to take it to see the view from the top as you can visit the highest peak in Singapore personally I would rather I used the time to visit other places but if you have the time its good to go."
,,Great view,5.0,,Great view from the cable car. Caught the cable car to Sentosa Island and it was a great day. Much better than any other transport method to the island.
,,Awosome view of Singapore.,4.0,,"well what to say about Cable car ride.we did enjoy a lot.had a great time.we laid back & enjoyed the spectacular view of the country from the top.If you are going to sentosa,don't miss to take cable car.there are lot of activities to do at Sentosa.From 4D show to adventure island & underwater world everything is such amazing.one will definitely enjoy a whole day at sentosa & will never get bored.I have visiting singapore 2nd time & never miss sentosa Island.the best attraction at Sentosa is Lazar show as songs of the sea. the beaches at sentosa are great & you will really enjoy party there as we did."
,,Worth doing atleast once,4.0,,"This is one of the ways to reach sentosa and the most expensive one too.
If you travel frequently to Sentosa ,then the boardwalk or sentosa express is recommended but do try this atleast once...The views are really good and you get to see Sentosa island from the top which u cannot otherwise..."
,,Wonderful views,4.0,,Great views. We used the cable car to travel from the Mount to Sentosa Island. Probably worth visiting if in Singapore.
,,Impressive but 1 rude staff member,3.0,,"Nice maintained canle cars, paid S$ 33 pp, for mt faber - sentosa vv and inner cable car trip on sentosa. Prices are not cheap ar all, but viewsare stunning. On every boarding station there was a small queue, staff members let all people riding together board together, without any problem. However When boarding at Sentosa back to the mainlaind, the rude female staff member without asking urged us to join a family in a car. I refused. In a rude tone she said ""must wait"" this was also the case of the couple behind us. The an empty car came acrosse and she pushe me with her hands on my shoulder ""board now"" please give this staff member a hospitality course, i paid 33 (x2) not te be treated rudely and disrespectful manner! She is a disgrace for this expensive day trip."
,,Cable Car in Singapore,4.0,,This was a fun ride across the harbour from Sentoca Island to the main land. We were there to watch the laser light show and came upon this cable car by accident so we thought lets go and we loved it.
,,Great views of Singapore and Sentosa,4.0,,We were pushed for time so this was an excellent way to see Sentosa and worth buying the return ticket. Sentosa would have taken a long time to walk otherwise so seeing the aerial view was great. Great photo opportunity too and you could stop off for a quick walk on the beach or for some food.
,,Don't miss this,5.0,,"If you are going to sentosa, don't miss to take cable car. Its not required to take the ticket from Mount Faber. Harbout station to Sentosa itself will give you a nice experience. Try to book both ways so that you can get both day and night views. Anyway there are lot of activities in sentosa. A day at sentosa is not enough."
,,Best way to approach Sentosa,5.0,,If you are planning to spend a day on the resort island of Sentosa then this is an ideal way to approach it. You get excellent views back across the city but can also get birds eye views of the attracions on the island.
,,Epic view of Sinapore,4.0,,Cozy laid-back way to enjoy the spectacular view of the country from the top. The tram ride is definitely worthwhile and it is also convenient to commute from one place to another.
,,Amazing views and great value,5.0,,"We started this at faber park and did the whole route with return, booked through klook,com and got a discount. Fantastic expedience with great views of the city and sentosa, definitely one to recommend"
,,Amazing round trip,5.0,,"An amazing round trip with a few stops. The happy stairs and bell are a great photo opportunity at Faber Peak. Take time to stop off at stations and look around. Be prepared to share a car if you are a small group, cars hold up to 8 people. A little expensive, with no concessions, however still worth the experience. Annual pass looked good value if you planned more than one visit, however, no one took the time to explain."
,,Amazing view,4.0,,"Gives a beautiful view of the entire city. If you are afraid of heights like me, and avoided flyer, this is better, as unlimited ride comes as package."
,,Amazing view,4.0,,Very pleasant experience with the Singapore cable car: it's a touristic attraction and also a mode of tranportation to go from one spot to another in Sentosa island. The cabins are spacious and you feel safe. The views over the harbourfront and Sentosa are breathtaking! I went up to Mount Faber first. And then went to Sentosa. A must-do
,,A ten minute of awesome beauty.,5.0,,"This is one of the highlights when you go to Sentosa Island. I tried all , mono rail, cab and Cable car. I loved this one. Moreover between Sentosa stations you can take this as many times as you like ..."
,,Great view,4.0,,"Great cable car, it's very high from the earth, you can see Singapore and Sentosa very well, advise you to go"
,,Good Views,4.0,,The cable car system in Sentosa island is both a tourist attraction and mode of transportation to get from one place to another. Good view when you get up there.
,,"Magical views, excellent food, friendly staff",5.0,,"We took the dining cable car trip, with just the two of us in our own cable car. The views were magical as the evening started to creep in, and the daylight faded.

The food was surprisingly excellent, we say this because we knew the food would have been prepared earlier as we had to inform them of our choices earlier in the week. But it was delicious!

The staff were very friendly, especially the waiting staff who changed courses at the end of each circuit.

The only small disappointment was the tacky photo and snow globe we were offered at the end of the trip for $50, which we declined.

10 out of 10 from us!"
,,"Amazing Views, Great Cabins",3.0,,"Amazing Views and Great Cabins, unfortunately they shut down with bad whether (which is fine) but isn't great when you by an all day pass and unfortunately don't even use the pass due to it being shut down. Only pay for what you know you will use baring in mind the whether as well. Definitely worth one trip though."
,,Nice View,3.0,,"Took a taxi to the hilltop and purchased tickets for a round trip. It was a public holiday so the ticketing took a while (we are not big fans of lines). The process could be made easier and more efficient with kiosks. The ride itself is great with fantastic overviews of Singapore, albeit a bit short. We did not go to Senosa but that looked from above to be a great family type excursion/waterpark."
,,For Indian tourist - A must try,5.0,,This was my first cable car experience. Happy to say that I was not disappointed. It was an amazing experience hanging so high with some breathtaking view.
,,yes take it,5.0,,go there to enjoy the experience and all the views . if you are scared of heights then you will probably get scared a bit
,,Birds eye view,5.0,,"This is a must do!! We took a taxi to the hilltop and purchased tickets before climbing a few sets of stairs to board a cable car. (Not sure if lift available). Go check out the view from the Loo/restrooms it's pretty good!! The journey across to Sentosa Island was awesome and picturesque lots of photo opportunities, we took the package for the 2 cable car experiences to include the island itself and you can get off at a couple of station stops on Sentosa. We loved the beach stop and I had to get my toes into the sand and beach. It's relaxing and great photo opportunities."
,,Nice views,4.0,,"Decided to get the annual pass for $135. This wasn't the most efficient process, but once you have it you're set for the year and it gives access to the original cable car and the newer line across Sentosa. Great views. Better to visit in the morning to avoid the crowds."
,,Birds eye view,5.0,,"A must go for ride , U can see the whole city in one go , a shuttle to Santosa. Gives a good view of the Bay as well as city. One can see port , city skyline and Santosa from above"
,,A short joy ride but not value for money,3.0,,"We bought a sky pass and had a 40% off from the McDonald's Monopoly coupon. It was an average experience and we feel it's a one time thing or it gets too boring (but we shouldn't expect too much because what more can cable cars do, right?)

One downside we had was that although we were told last boarding was at 9:30pm, the shutters were already down at 9:20pm, which was really upsetting as we rushed from Universal Studios to the Merlion station hoping to catch the last boarding time - which we unfortunately did not as it was closed earlier than the stated timing. Nonetheless, we're thankful that there was a monorail station across the cable car station.

Wouldn't have bought tickets if we didn't have the 40% off as we feel that the tickets are a little overpriced before the discount. Like I mentioned earlier, it's just a one time thing."
,,Nice Ride to sentosa!!,5.0,,We took the cable car on our way back to Singapore from sentosa ....loved the ride and the skyline of sentosa island well decorated !!
,,Great views,4.0,,"If we want aerial views of Singapore then this is a must do activity but if you are scared of heights it will be a challenge, particularly in windy weather. Definitely the best way to travel to Sentosa!"
,,Amazing View and Spacious Cable Car,4.0,,"View is spectacular and seat is spacious compare to the old ones but not the best in the world. For Singapore it is good enough.

Good for family including toddlers and old adults to be in the cable car as the speed is at a comfortable timing and each station staff offer helpful information and also friendly"
,,Beautiful Views,5.0,,A nice way to get scenic views of Sentosa Island. You can hop on and off at every station if you have time or just take a round trip and enjoy the view. Sunset view from Mount Faber was beautiful so plan your visit.
,,Best Way To Go To Sentosa Island,5.0,,"My wife, two children and I visited Singapore in June 2016. We took the Singapore Cable Car to Sentosa Island. Going there the views of Sentosa Island were great and going back the views of the Singapore skyline were great. On Sentosa Island, you can...More"
,,Breath Taking View,5.0,,Must ride the cable car to Sentosa...amazning areial view of the city and perfect to take some nice picture of the city and Sentosa.
,,Another must do in Singapore,5.0,,Fun little trip for the whole family. Scenic and a different way to get back to accommodation on Sentosa Island from shopping centre. Conveniently located
,,Interesting Ride,5.0,,"Very modern cable cars. It's an interesting ride from Mount Faber to Sentosa Island. You can see very good view of the surrounding. The tickets include the cable car rides on Sentosa island as well. At the ticket counter, you can get many discounted tickets...More"
,,Good but not the best in the world,4.0,,It's a good option to go towards Sentosa. I sat in it once but it's nothing extra-ordinary. Yes it offers good views but that's expected.. isn't it?
,,good view and relaxing,5.0,,"Like Singapore Flyer, it provides good view of the city. Staff were friendly. This is a good way to go to Merlion Tower, Madame Tussauds, Sentosa."
,,Lovely views,5.0,,"Smooth ride, easy access and friendly staff make this a lovely option for travel across Sentosa. We chose a package along with the observation tower and butterfly house. Really worth it."
,,Family vacation,5.0,,Friendly staff at the ticket counters. Beautiful views from the cable car. There are stops along the cable route to get out and explore.
,,High up in the sky..,5.0,,"A great view around from this cable car, it travels from the mainland to an island. We could view most of the Singapore bay area. We happened to ride right over a cruise docked under. Going through this cable car can be a little scary...More"
,,Must Experience for Awesome View of the City...,5.0,,"one can go to Sentosa island in Cable car and that's the ideal way to experience this cable car ride.. Beautiful View from the cable car, again safe and not scary at all.. Must visit.. see more photos for to get insight.."
,,Great views,5.0,,"I bu the Singapore pass and visit this cable that goes to Sentosa, great experience to see Indonesia ,Japan and Singapore at distance , the hotels we pass up and the Universal STUDIOS ."
,,Not that interesting,2.0,,"There are cheaper options if you’re just trying to get from point A to point B. Yes, the cable cars offer nice views, but other than the theme parks, there’s really not much else to see. Recommended if you are pressed for time and just want to have a quick and easy overview of Sentosa. Otherwise, just stick to the casino and call it a day. Or just skip Sentosa altogether"
,,A nice way to go to Sentosa,4.0,,"We took a return trip to Sentosa Island – it’s great to take a 15 min ride above the port, especially if you like ship spotting. You can also use the cable car to travel along the Island between the various attractions or take the long tour to the mountain. We saw people having lunch in the cars while traveling so it’s another idea of how to enjoy both a meal and a ride in the sky.
We got a day ticket with iVenture pass so admission was free for us."
,,Unavoidable visit?,5.0,,"As a solo traveller, you can give Santosa Island a miss if you are not fond of theme parks. If like me you like a quick bird's eye view of the city you are visiting, a ride on the Singapore Cable Car certainly provides that."
,,Easy way to get to Sentosa,4.0,,Easy way to see parts of Sentosa Island and you can map out where things are. Also the ticketing place has special on for all the activities.
,,Excellent view but short ride,4.0,,"Took the cable car ride from Mt Faber to Sentosa, we reached around 11am and there was no queue at all. If there is long queue, they will put max 8ppl in 1 cabin, since no queue four of us just took 1 cabin. During the ride from Mt Faber, you can see trees at first, then the harbourfront area with cruise ships and ferries. Passing by the Harbourfront, on the way to Sentosa, you can see apartments, Resort world, sentosa cove and the dolphin lagoon - we were able to see dolphins jumping out of water too. There was no aircond in the cabin, so during sunny hot day, be prepared to sweat and the small fans in the cabin don't have any effect at all. Overall, we enjoy the ride very much."
,,Dining on Cloud 9,5.0,,"We booked the cable car dining experience for 2. The staff were really friendly and well organised.
We were greeted with a glass of wine while waiting to board our private cable car.
We did several loops on the cable car. The first dish started when we first hopped onto the cable car and each time we would return to the beginning the staff would quickly change our meal out and replace it with the next course which was great as it meant our food was nice and hot by the time we would be served it. And having a different course each time we did a full loop on the cable meant we could take in the views and relax while eating each course
The meals were delicious hot and fresh. It was a little expensive @ $288 for the two of us but totally worth it for the unique experience."
,,Cable Car,5.0,,I had a lot of fun on a round trip cable car ride on board the Cable Car Sky Network at Faber Peak and Sentosa. One can spend the whole day on the Highland without getting bored. I got to visit Madame Tussauds and Images of Singapore. There are a lot of fun places to visit in Sentosa.
,,Go from Harbourfront to Sentosa,5.0,,"For people who have already experienced the feel of cable car, this won't be that interesting because it is the same. But for me, the view is more important. We took the ride from Harbour front to Sentosa and then back to Faber park. The view from Harbourfront to Sentosa is amazing. We saw a cruise ship below us while on the cable car and it was a beautiful experience. I do not recommend going to Faber park as there is nothing much to explore there."
,,Great views.,4.0,,Very well run and operated. Great views looking out to Sentosa Island. This is a great family activity.
,,Amazing views and a great way to travel,5.0,,"I was lucky enough to have an excellent taxi driver who recommended taking the cable car from Faber Peak into Sentosa Island as opposed to from the Harbour terminal. It was well worth the few extra dollars and was amazing. The staff were extremely friendly, the cable car clean and tidy and the views are nothing short of spectacular. Well worth a visit!"
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"There are various ways of getting to Sentosa but this one has to be the best. When you buy your ticket for the cable car I would suggest getting a multi ticket - this gives you access to other attractions on th Island and a much cheaper way to do it. The cable car ticket can include a mini tour of the Island. You cannot purchase this once you are on the Island and it was a really great tour- you get to see places on the island not accessible by other public transport means.
We ""cabled"" all over the island - your Cable Car ticket is not just for getting there and back."
,,Average,3.0,,Paid for the 3 part journey only to find that the middle part was closed thus lsing the chance for the location attractions
,,Great views,5.0,,We did from Mount Faber to Sentosa and all across island. Good for everyone to see views. On return don't go back to Mount Faber as impossible to get transport from there.
,,Good Ride,4.0,,It was a nice ride on the island. The highlight was seeing a parked Cruise Liner and the view from the top.
,,Good view,4.0,,"I am living in Singapore and had not ride the cable car since I was a little kid. Took my 6 year old on his cable car ride as he insisted.

It was nice to see familiar scenes from above like the Adventure Cove waterpark.

I bought the Mount Faber and Sentosa line package. We got down at every single station and walk around. Nice way to spend an afternoon. Located different places to visit when I next drive into Sentosa."
,,nice view,5.0,,"we bought tickets at vivo city for 29 sgd pp we got up to the cable car floor with elevator and there we got on the elevator which first goes up to the mount faber where you can get off and walk around the mount then take another cable car and go directly to the sentosa island , if you wanna get a great view of the city , mount faber and sentosa its the best way ever to have it all"
,,Good way to see Singapore,4.0,,Make sure you start the journey at Mount Fabre at the very start of the cable car. It's worth going to the very end to see the recreation of the artillery positions
,,Cool,5.0,,"I took the cable car tonight to get to Sentosa, Kinda cool going across the roads, through the buildings, across the water. Nice views, Glad I did it!"
,,A great way to see Singapore,5.0,,"We loved this experience, would recommend this to all a great way to see all of Singapore. Would do this if we went again"
,,Good vistas!,4.0,,Great way to get an aerial view of downtown Singapore. Nice vistas and picture opportunities. For the family.
,,Efficient and smooth,4.0,,"It's a cable car linking Sentosa island with the city. Each car can carry upto eight people, although six is more comfortable. It is worth buying a return ticket from Faber peak, although transportation from there is a bit expensive after sundown."
,,Great view from above,5.0,,"Great way to explore Sentosa, very cheap, a smooth ride, cable car comes very frequently, it does have some sections open to take photos. If you want to see more pictures of Singapore my instagram is apipan30"
,,Beautiful views heading to Sentosa Island,5.0,,"Great place to see Singapore from a height.
Can be accessed by bus, foot, taxi or car.
I walked here from the city and cut through a beautiful park, although it was a little steep if you're not too good with walking.
They also sell packages for other rides on the island, which can be a penny saver.
If you think it's too pricey you can always do one way trip and get the free tram back or vice versa.
Staff all spoke English and were friendly and happy to answer any questions."
,,Fantastic views and a great ride,5.0,,We rode in the cable car from Sentosa Island across to the mainland and thoroughly enjoyed the ride. Fantastic views of land and sea.
,,Best way to reach Sentosa Island which is the entertainment center of Singapore,4.0,,"Quiet safe ride over the harbor of Singapore, connecting the city to Sentosa entertainment district."
,,Can't get enough! LOVE it!,5.0,,"I bought free and easy unlimited ride for SGD 50. And it was worthed. I loved every ride I took today. It was perfect!

Tips: Buy Free & Easy Package. Unlimited Cable Car Ride + 2 attractions ride at Sentosa for SGD50 or 4 attractions ride for SGD65. It saved a lot than buy it each."
,,Cable car for Visiting Faber Peak and Santosa,4.0,,"Hi,

I would recommend to buy a 2 way pass from harbourfront. It is better to start early and go to faber Peak. This is highest peak of Singapore and you can see both side of Singapore.

On other side you can go to sentosa which is major attraction. I would recommend it for all ages. You will enjoy the ride."
,,Really nice way to get around,5.0,,"Good views and gets you to places that otherwise would require some convoluted traveling. Cable cars can be a bit overly warm on hot days and some ""stations"" are not too easy to find."
,,Fabulous Night View,4.0,,Ride the cable car just before sunset on a round trip and you will be rewarded with an amazing view of Singapore's skyline in the night along with all of Sentosa. The entrance to the cable car is a challenge to find in the maze of Vivocity Mall. Better to get it from Faber.

,,Another attraction of Singapore,5.0,,"Singapore Cable car has been operated since 1974 and it has been the long last attraction of Singapore ever. The first time when i took the cable car with my family was 14 years ago and they still running very well with regular maintenance. They have 3 stations; one in Vivo Cit, another in Mt. Faber and the last one in Sentosa Imbiah Station.
Normally the ticket of Cable car for round trip (from Vivo city to Sentosa), excluding the admission to Sentosa Island
is $13 per person for adult.
I am sure the attraction is worth to spend of."
,,Santosa Island trip,5.0,,"Went on the Cable Cars to Santosa Island, very efficient, easy to find, can buy package deals for the trip plus attractions on the island eg Universal Studios. The view from the cable cars is fantastic, taking you right over the top of passenger ships waiting to depart from port. We purchased a small package for two adults plus return trip to the Harbourfront MRT. Great day all round."
,,easiest way to reach sentosa,4.0,,this one has breathtaking views of the sentosa island ..a must visit to view the island..nice pictures
,,Best way to enter Sentosa,5.0,,"A short walk from the MRT-stop we found the best way to enter Sentosa Island. The cable-car was not too busy, had good aircondition and a great view of the harbor and the different sights at Sentosa."
,,One Ride is not Enough,5.0,,"Took this ride on our way back from Sentosa Island. We took a lot of escalators to reach on top near Tiger Tower. Once we boarded the car, the view was stunning. We could almost see the whole of Sentosa island on one side and harbour front on another side. Its great ride to be taken in daylight and night. Bothe have their own beauty. Couples can also book a romantic dinned in once of the special cars. It will keep you high, when you spend some quality time with your loved ones."
,,Thrilling experience...,5.0,,"If you like thrill, you should surely go for this and you should take a ticket for the complete round, thrrough this you would be able to see the whole Singapore from the top."
,,Great views,4.0,,Loved the views over Singapore well worth the ride. We took some great pictures and enjoyed the ride with our friends
,,Breathtaking..,5.0,,"We went to Imbiah Lookout and bought a combined ticket for both lines, one for Mount Faber and one for Sentosa. Both are breath taking. You can have a rest in a nice cafe at the top of Mount Faber and then continue your journey. We fell in love with Sentosa once again when we had this tour. Highly recommended."
,,"If you have been on a cable car, don't bother",2.0,,This cable car is so expensive for what it is and then you get to Sentosa and have to pay more money again if you want to go on the one there. Totally regretted this decision. I paid online so got it a little cheaper and only used it 1 way as we stayed late on the island and got the train back instead. Save your money for something more worthwhile.
,,Great way to access Sentosa,5.0,,The cable car ride was excellent and very much enjoyed on our visit to Sentosa. We were able to see many places of interest from the air as we travelled. A solid floor on the cars dispelled concerns about heights.
,,Another attraction of Singapore,5.0,,"Singapore Cable car has been operated since 1974 and it has been the long last attraction of Singapore ever. The first time when i took the cable car with my family was 14 years ago and they still running very well with regular maintenance. They have 3 stations; one in Vivo Cit, another in Mt. Faber and the last one in Sentosa Imbiah Station.
Normally the ticket of Cable car for round trip (from Vivo city to Sentosa), excluding the admission to Sentosa Island
is $13 per person for adult.
I am sure the attraction is worth to spend of."

,,absolutely fabulous,5.0,,I just loved this part of our overall tour to sentosa the views were just magnificent and my friend was afraid of heights and our guide Christopher got her through without incident..
,,Amazing views,5.0,,We enjoyed the ride on the cable car - you need to go on the monorail to get to the cable car station. We did both trips which was worth while. Thought it was a bit expensive considering you aren't on the cable cars for long.
,,Good way to Enter Sentosa,3.0,,It has a long que but you can access to visit harbor town and sentosa island. You may collect ticket by paying at counter for 10 $
,,Great Views.,5.0,,Singapore Cable Car gives you an exciting ride from Sentosa Island to Mt Faber and back. I found the views from this cable car fantastic and great opportunity to take a few photo's.
,,Must ride,5.0,,This cable car provides great view of the city and you can take it while your journey to Sentosa Island. Dont MIss!! Its better than Singapore Flyer.
,,Great view travelling to Sentosa Island,5.0,,"Great way to see the sights while travelling across to Sentosa Island. The view of the entire Singapore area was spectacular.
We spent the whole day at Universal Studios and did not see any other part of the island as we ran out of time. We needed at least one more day to see it all."
,,Family Trip,4.0,,We took the cable car at the end of the day after Universal Studios. Was nice and relaxing and well organised from ticket purchase to ride.
,,Lovely way to get to and from Sentosa,5.0,,"Travelling on the cable car gives stunning views over Sentosa and the surrounding areas. Well worth the money in my opinion. Carriages are clean and airy and access to get on and off is easy, even with young children."
,,Nice view. A bit pricey depending on use.,4.0,,"I took the ride from the mountain to Sentosa and back. All up that component cost $33. That price did include the cable car on Sentosa Island as well, however. It also allowed for riding the the entire day. Neither of which I used.

The view was very nice and provides a good view of the island and Singapore.

The car itself was comfortable enough and had dual fans to enhance comfort. I imagine they would struggle on a really hot day.

All up a good experience."
,,Great views,5.0,,Takes you over to Faber point where we had a meal at the Faber bistro. Great views of the city. Well worth a trip.
,,A pleasent afternoon,4.0,,"The multiple cable car rides are a great way to see some different areas of Singapore, and if you want to have a nice lunch at Mt Faber the food is very good. If you can try and miss the crowds in the afternoon as you can have a bit of a wait. Sentosa Island is great for the kids with Universal Studios, the water park and many more attractions. You have great views from the cable cars over the harbour."
,,Night Rides are awesome!,5.0,,This was our last location to visit before we left for the airport. We visited late afternoon and took the cable car in the evening. It was a wonderful experience seeing this part of the city at night.
,,pleasant trip,4.0,,"This is one way of accessing Sentosa. Was nothing spectacular, just a pleasant experience. Had to wait in a queue for around 20 minutes, even though there were only few people before us."
,,Cable car return to Sentosa island,5.0,,Thought I would take the Scenic route to Sentosa island - it's a great ride caught it from harbour front on my way to and back from universal studios.. no air con but I was happy with just natural air.. Enjoyable
,,Skyline views,3.0,,"Took the trip from Harbourtown. About 10min walk from mall to the actual cable car station. Great view of Sentosa and Singapore Harbour. Limited value when actually on Sentosa. Trip up to Faber was unfortunately too late in the day to explore, but you'd need to really get around up there to see full value for the price of the tickets."
,,Great Views,5.0,,Great views go early in the morning or late afternoon to avoid the crowds visit Sentosa beach and see the hundreds of ships waiting to be unloaded in the worlds busiest port
,,Fairly Good,4.0,,"This is perhaps better than Singapore flyer. Instead a slow motion movement, this gives a much better view of Singapore from above. All in all an exciting place."
,,Great way to get to Sentosa Island,5.0,,"We hopped on the Cable Cars to get over to Sentosa Island to go to Universal Studios. Easy way to get there, we were able to share a car with another passenger over and had a car to ourselves on our return trip. Great views of Sentosa Island, and the surrounding areas."
,,A great experience,5.0,,"Take the cable car ride to Sentosa from the main land and you will never regret it. It provides such a beautiful arial view of sentosa, sea and the mainland that you wouldnt want the journey to end. While returning back the lights are a treat. One cable car can accommodate upto 6 people if you want to go in group."
,,Great,5.0,,"We decided that this was a must as it was one of the ways you could get to Santosa island where the Universal studios was. My first thoughts were ""I can'nt do this, as I am frightend of heights"" however, once on we did the full return journey and it wasn't as bad as I thought. When we went to the very top which was Faber Gardens where you could have a meal overlooking the area below or a coffee etc. There was also a pool with some beautiful Koi and the ""Happiness Bell"" which is famous and you can give it a ring.. The cost was 29 SD, so not bad when you transfer to English currency."
,,Have my Mount Faber Licence,4.0,,I love the cable car - it's a lovely way to travel to Sentosa and for basically the same price you can get a card to go back and back again. It's good value if you live here but not so much for a tourist. There is a restaurant at the Mt Faber side and does great fries and beer
,,Exhilarating View!,5.0,,Be sure to book it in advance. This maybe full on weekends. Had a great fun. Bring your best camera and take a picture to your hearts extent. Super great view!
,,A Solo ride,4.0,,I love to reminisce my time taking my Singapore cable car ride. It was a solo ride but yes the view is great and so is the experience...
,,Cable Cars in amazing scenery,5.0,,Great experience to see everything from above! Especially beautiful Sentosa island with lovely beaches. Fast and cheap way to have a bigger view at Singapore.
,,Great views,5.0,,"The cable car took us to Mt Fabre then to Sentosa island, we got off had lunch at MT Fabre and a walk to Fabre point. It was nice, we could have done some trekking there, but we didn't have time."
,,Very intersting way to cross over to Santosa Island.,4.0,,Very intersting way to cross over to Santosa Island. Unfortunatly on the day we used the Cable Car it was during a tropical rain storm but views were still spectacular>
,,Long weekend,5.0,,Not for the fear of heights kind of people - this is a very nice way to see the surrounding area head to the top and enjoy a cool drink
,,Excellent ride. great view,5.0,,"had a good time up on the cable car. Very well done. Nice little history museum too. Apparently, this route has been here for some time. They are on at least their 5th or 6th generation of cars and cables. Nice restaurant on the top section for a good view lunch"
,,"Up, up and away",5.0,,WOW! I'm actually afraid of heights but with this one you won't feel too scared because it's not shaky or anything. The ride was calm and steady. Plus we had a great view of the city.
,,Very short ride for the price,3.0,,Expensive by Singapore standards when you can get here by metro and walk across for free. Such a short ride for limited views of city and Sentosa. Oddity is having to go up/down to catch the cable car from street level. It's not very well linked with the metro or mall. Very few people carry on to Mount Faber.
,,Good view,5.0,,Do not miss this. This ride will give you a wonderful birds eye view of the city and Sentosa. Plan the ride in the night.
,,Don't look down...,5.0,,"Even though I'm petrified of heights I really enjoyed the cable cars.....well enjoyed them more when I was back on the ground but still. Crossing over to Sentosa island it really does reach quite a height.
We didn't have to queue for any of our journeys had the cable cars all to ourself. There's two separate lines, but you don't have to pay for both if you don't want to, although we did and didn't complain about the price as thought the journey and views were certainly worthwhile.
Being on a cable car that goes through a high rise tower block, up to a mountain, high over the water to Sentosa then on a separate line across the island made this unique journey rather exciting and we would certainly recommend it to anyone visiting Singapore."
,,A Lovely overview of the city,4.0,,We did the full round trip and we weren't disappointed. You have to change cars once over onto Sentosa Island but it was good to see the man made beaches and water world from above.
,,I went but I was scared to get on...,5.0,,"This is located in Santosa, and that is where the aquarium and Universal Studio's are located, I went to visit all of that but I did not want to get on the cable car, too high!"
,,Good views,4.0,,"The cable car is a must do in Singapore giving great views of sentosa island and the singapore dock area.
The ticket purchase gives you a round trip ticket so you can catch it at mount faber, spend the day on Sentosa island then catch the cable car back in the evening.
I didn't bother with the sentosa line so can't comment on that line, not sure the Sentosa line would be worth it."
,,Excellent cable car trip,4.0,,"This a very large and impressive cable car set up, and probably one of the longest ones I have ever had a trip on"
,,Must ride the cable car if you visit Singapore,4.0,,"If you are visiting Singapore then this ride is a must. You can relax and have a wonderful bird's eye view of the Island. Even though it is little bit expensive, it is worth the price and the memories will stay with you for life."
,,Long journey,5.0,,journey thru the entire stretch is so enjoyable. Around sentosa island will give a new experience.To and fro to Universal Studios also make you feel as unique experience
,,"Interesting, but felt like in an oven",3.0,,"Interesting, one can see Harbour Front and Sentosa area from different angle. Certain things only can be seen from high above.

Too bad, I took the ride around late morning or noon. Inside the Cable Car was super hot, felt like in an oven. There is little fan which doesn't really help in hot humid weather of Singapore, especially during summer. That is an area where management could do something to improve it."
,,Amazing view.,5.0,,Amazing view and very short lines. A perfect way to travel to Sentosa. I'm really happy that I went. No queues and good service.
,,Quite a great Experience,4.0,,I quite enjoy the ride. A better way to see the landscape in a different way than a high tower or similar.

,,Relaxing ride,4.0,,"A lovely way to spend a morning is to ride the cable car in Singapore to Sentosa Island. As we did not have a lot of time, my daughter and I opted not to get off but to simply continue on a round trip just to experience the view and enjoy the ride. We thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward to next visit to Singapore when we can get off at Sentosa and have a look around. Even so we were very happy and would recommend it"
,,Its very good worth taking,4.0,,"We had taken Hongkong cable car with glass bottom that was really amazing . Still this was worth taking . It exciting an good view we used this during 3pm . it was warm and good view . We saw this was operating during night also . I think it was worth ride during night .But not sure . We used this to reach sentosa , which was part of the setosa package"

,,Great views from this fun and exciting attraction!,5.0,,"The cable car is a great way to see parts of Singapore that you may not see anywhere else!

,,Worth doing once,4.0,,I've been to Sentosa about 7 times and took the cablebcar there only the first time - probably the most exciting way to do it. Was great. Pretty high. The alternative modes of transport (monrail n footbridge) are great and quicker.
,,Great way to see Singapore from above,5.0,,"If you live in Singapore it's worth buying a season pass. We have been many times with family and friends already.

The views are amazing. Start at Fort Faber to get the full affect. Make sure to stop by the kissing tree and the gift shop to by a lock.

Once in the cable car enjoy the ride down to Sentosa."

,,Transport with a view,4.0,,"The cable car ticket is priced highly but is a great way to look around several places with the one ticket in a hop on, hop off format.

,,Cable car ride,5.0,,Iconic Singapore cable car ride across a very busy harbour providing wonderful views of the scenic harbour and the Sentosa holiday resort island where the ride will end.

,,Amazing Cable Car,5.0,,"The revamp cable car that connects Sentosa island with the main land provides a new experience compared to the ""old"" ones that we tried back in 2009. The Cable Car is more stable and not very susceptible to wind. Safety features have been enhanced greatly. It is worth a try.

As we stayed at the Festive Hotel within the Universal Studio, the cable car provides transportation to the Harbour Front. Very easy ride and all round availability from Imbiah Station just next to the Merlion Statue helps the tourists to reach the Vivocity for a quick shopping trip."
,,Good views!,5.0,,Like any other cable car journey this one is also exciting for the views it offers. The way to the ticket counters was quite long though with no clear indications.
,,nice views,4.0,,took the trips into and on the sentosa island and the views from the cable car are superb. the ride on sentosa had a zip wire going under and we saw some riders on the zip wire too. worth visiting.
,,Fantastic view!,5.0,,Fantastic view over central/western Singapore and Sentosa/Keppel. Cars are modern and clean. Pricing model makes it sensible to buy a year card which is abit annoying.
,,Spectacular Views,5.0,,The Cable car ride to Sentosa is enjoyable with a wide 360 degree visual of the city and surrounds. It shows why Singapore has one of the largest ports in the world with the many hundreds of cargo ships and the Cruise liners. The facilities and shopping in this area are also well worth the visit.
,,Cable Car ride (just for the experience) not just for reaching Sentosa,4.0,,"The Cable Car ride came in as part of the tour package. However, this ride (on both lines) is worth making, just to have Ariel view of the Sentosa & Singapore port nearby."

,,Views and Travel,4.0,,"We purchased our combined Singapore Cable Car and Sentosa Cable Car tickets at the Chinatown Visitors Centre which was cheaper. It cost S$28 per adult. The large cable car goes from Faber Peak on the mainland, through a couple of stations to Sentosa Island. You can get off at each stop if you wish, then continue your journey. Once on Sentosa the smaller cable cars goes across the island from the Merlion, through Imbiah Lookout to Silosa Point. Again, you can get off and then back on again. The views are just amazing from all points and there are great photo opportunities. If you are heading to Sentosa, it gives you a good overview of the island and helps orientate you as well.
It wasn't busy when we were there and we found the staff incredibly generous and helpful. With just the two of us, they even allowed us to have a cable car all to ourselves instead of grouping us with others - definitely a nice touch!"
,,Singapore Odyssey,4.0,,"Fun.You need to combine this with at least 3 hours in Sentosa.The start of an excellent day out.Most people I suspect will go one way,see the attractions of Sentosa and walk or bus back.Bring hat,sunscreen money as good beaches and attractions on Sentosa."

,,Best way to get to Sentosa,4.0,,"Modern cable cars that feel safe and offer fantastic views. On our initial trip to Sentosa a storm blew in and blew us around a fair bit. Although we felt safe, it was still scary! When we came back over at the end of the day, we stayed on and went back both ways to make up for the first stormy trip. The tickets allowed unlimited trips (as long as you don't get off the car back at Mt Faber), so it was great to have the opportunity :)"
,,cable car to sentosa island,4.0,,"This is the cable car which takes you to Sentosa island, which is a theme park island, with an aquarium, water parks & a beach.

Very smooth ride and awesome views of all Sentosa Island"
,,Great views during the day,4.0,,"Excellent views during the day and if you have young tott (below a certain age) they get a ride for free!

I would think the views are great during the day but not so much at night.

Avoid weekends/school holiday periods as the wait times do become considerably longer & theres pretty much nothing to do mt faber.

The ride was entertaining - but if its a nice sunny day it might become a little warm in the cabin, so stock up on some cold drinks and a portable fan!"
,,why not?!,5.0,,"It is something different then the rest of sightseeing in Singapore. It is fun for kids, family or couple as well. Nice view!"

,,Exciting!,5.0,,"My Husband was reluctant to do this as he does not like heights but, in fact, you forgot about it. It was lovely and quiet and you just relaxed into it enjoying the views. My children often refer back to the cable car ride as it has stuck in their mind. It's well worth it!"
,,Excellent views,4.0,,This is a must see when in Singapore. Get your cameras. Should be fun with the kids. In case if you are a couple do plan on entering the car at the right time ;-) to avoid being huddled along with strangers.
,,A memorable experience!!,5.0,,"Riding up high in the mountains in a cable car is an ultimate experience. This cable car line was located on Mount Faber Peak. Simply buy a ticket and hop into one of the enclosed cable cars, in which you can stand against the glass and watch the snow white mountain slopes pass underneath, as you get on to the other side. If you travel to Singapore, do not miss this!! Visited in 2010 (not in the dropdown)."
,,Best way of getting to Sentosa Island.,5.0,,We took the cable car over to Sentosa as opposed to a cab or train and the view was simply extraordinary. Could not fault the experience. Was definitely worth the money :)

,,Great View of Singapore,5.0,,Great way to view the city. Amazing views! Buy the sky pass for both lines as it isn't much more money and it is worth it.
,,Sentosa,4.0,,Great way to end a long day on Sentosa Island. Took the cable car rather than queue 40 mins for the monorail
,,Birds eye view,5.0,,"Best way to get to Sentosa island. Beautiful scenic view of the island all around, you can see ships and cruises passing beneath you. The trip lasts around 15 min, it is quite expensive costing 33$ for a round trip, so if you are tight on the budget a one-way trip will absolutely do."
,,Best option to get to-fro Sentosa.,5.0,,"If you're going to Sentosa, you can walk (cheapest), taxi, drive, cycle, scoot, bus, or you can do it in style... in a Cable Car.
Yes, this is an attraction and an experience you want to leave Singapore with.
I'm Singaporean, but I've been in this car numerous occasions. The view (on a good day) is stunning. It runs so slowly, you can capture photos and videos with no blur. It is also very relaxing (on a cool day) with the breeze blowing in through specially-cut vents in the cabin. You can fit a family in it and the kids will surely have a great time trying to rock the car (please don't).

Do it. Go in style. Do the Cable Car!"
,,An experience not to be missed,5.0,,We stayed in Singapore for 5 days and if you are going to Sentosa go by the cable car its a great experience but dont go if you dont like heights.

,,"Longest, slowest queue imaginable",1.0,,"Book ahead and save yourself alot of time. Its very frustrating. For some reason, the counter acts as a tourist advisory centre and ticket office."
,,top views,5.0,,Birds eye view of Singapore...a must do attraction if you are not scared of heights.Make sure you purchase a ticket to do all stops.
,,Amazing views,5.0,,Although you have the option to travel by road to Sentosa island but a one way ride by cable car is a must

,,A great ride,5.0,,Well worth the trip. A wonderful view of the city and surrounds giving a great look at some of the architecture. Go first thing in the morning zs it can get hot.
,,Good view,4.0,,Something to tick off the bucket list. On a hot day the cable cars tend be very uncomfortable. There are two cable car lines - be very careful which one choose . There is one to and fro sentosa. The other one is to ferry inside the island itself.
,,Spectacular views,5.0,,The cable cars gave us an excellent opportunity to relax after a long day of walking and look over the mountains and sentosa.
,,Great way to get to Sentosa but very scary for those afraid of heights!,4.0,,"Wow, the views are amazing from the cable car. The kids loved this but I was so scared. We went on a calm day but I can imagine how scary it would be on a windy day. Definitely not one to miss when visiting Singapore. Amazing machinery at work!"
,,Good Photo Opportunity but Expensive,3.0,,It is worth riding the cable car over to Sentosa Island for great photos but beware that it is quite pricey.
,,Good view from Cable Car,4.0,,You can get an amazing view of Sentosa island from the cable car. It was a nice ride while going to Sentosa island. Many popular attractions can be seen from the cable car.

,,Good photo oportunities.,4.0,,Take the cable car from Mount Faber down to the park and get some great views and photo ops along the way.
,,Worth doing if you travel to Sentosa,4.0,,We been to Sentosa island many times but never try the cable car and we give it a go this time. It worth it. My children love it and very excited. The scenic is amazing and we love it!
,,On the expensive side but a must do!,4.0,,"Look out for 10% discount vouchers in the tourist maps. It is around $33 for a round trip on both rides for anyone aged 13 and above. There is a small discount for children.

We did not share any cars and enjoyed being able to break up the trip at various points.

The Sentosa line is the short ride. The ride up to Faber Peak is longer and higher! Had fantastic views (despite the haze) of the harbor area.

The cars are smooth and modern."
,,"Okay, but seriously expensive for what it is.",2.0,,"Okay, but seriously expensive for what it is. Sentosa, the State of Fun(ds) is overpriced and this just adds to it. Better off walking from the Mt Faber cable car station and over the Henderson waves bridge along the Kent Ridge. Then take a taxi and enjoy a Singapore Sling, or two, at Raffles for the same price."
,,Cool view,4.0,,"The view from the cable car is really nice. However, one has to know that the entire Sentosa island hosts man-made parks and even a man-made strip of sandy beach. It looks a bit fake (as it is) but all in all, it is a fun way to spend an evening in Singapore. P.S. Do not recommend the bars and restaurants at Sentosa - they are overpriced and simply touristy!"
,,Afraid of Heights,5.0,,This experience will melt your fear of heights and lets you enjoy the beautiful view of the sentosa areas and the surrounding bay and sea
,,Fun ride!,4.0,,"Took the cable car ride from Vivo City going to Sentosa with a group of friends. It was fun, you get the view of the city as well as the view from above over Sentosa Island. I would do it again if I'll get a chance to go back."
,,Amazing view,4.0,,You get a very good view of southern shoreline of Singapore. The ticket includes cable ride within sentosa too. The cabin are very spacious in fact fits pram easily if you have toddler with you. The staff was also very cheerful. Overall short but sweet experience.
,,A classic in Singapore,4.0,,It is a classic attraction since I started visiting Singapore and the scene of a cable car leaving Sentosa Island is just part of the skyline ! Now they even give you a private dinner option as you go up and down .
,,Great,5.0,,"Excellent way to see views of Singapore, Sentosa Island and the shipping port. Reasonably priced, no queues, friendly staff."
,,Cable Car,5.0,,Have done the Cable Car at night & during the day. Must admit to be terrified at night but once i overcame this the view is great.

,,"Fantastic views, well worth doing!",5.0,,"I'm not good with heights generally, but the rest of the family wanted to do this so I went. So glad I did, superb views and felt very safe inside the pod."
,,Beautiful view,5.0,,Gorgeous view and make sure you take it up to Mt Faber and check out the view from the toilets! Lovely but very expensive might not be affordable for families.
,,Singapore Cable car,3.0,,We had a go on the cable car from Sentosa lookout to Harbour town it was pretty average and didn't have the wow factor of other cable cars from around the world but if you have never been on one it would make an iconic part of your Singapore trip
,,Great Views,4.0,,I think this is a great way to get to Sentosa or to view some of what Singapore has on offer. You have a few differernt options for returns and stop offs. We bought a round trip to Sentosa which I think was about $30AUD each. The cars run constantly so there is not a lot of waiting around and the staff generally try and sit you in one on your own when its not too busy.
,,Amazing view,5.0,,Best way to get to Sentosa Island and enjoy amazing view of the beaches and harbour. Not for you if you dont like heights or ar limited on funds.
,,Amazing Views of Singapore and a Fun Ride,5.0,,"We took the cable car up to the mountain and then to Sentosa Island. The views of the city were amazing. I was a little nervous at first going over the water and being so high up, but I got over it pretty quickly. I think this is absolutely something every tourist should do when visiting Singapore!"
,,Fantastic view!,4.0,,One nicest things I did in singapore. It's value for money and gives you an amazing view! Remember to take a video camera and camera cause you will want to take back the memories!
,,Great way to travel with kids in Singapore,5.0,,"Used the cable car on an all day ticket and travelled around Sentosa, across to Vivo City and back.

It offers great views of the southern side of the city and we also had a cruise ship in to add to our pics.

It is very easy to find your way around the cable car system and we really enjoyed this convenient mode of travel particularily when it is hot..a common occurence in Singapore."
,,Nice experience,5.0,,Must do activity while in Singapore.Visit SENTOSA island and enjoy the cable ride.We had fun as a family.
,,"A bit pricey, but great views.",5.0,,"I think the best way to do the cable car is to start further down the path - maybe at the Alexandra Bridge or Hort Park then walk to the Jewel box. It'll take an hour or two depending on where you start, but the different sections are every interesting and it's mostly shady. Then take the cable car across to Sentosa, walk straight down to the beach and jump in the ocean to cool off."
,,Great experience,5.0,,This is a great way to get a view across the city and to visit Sentosa... Loved the ease and convenience and of course every team member is characteristically charming
,,Great views,5.0,,This is a great way to see the layout of Singapore from up high. It is reasonably priced also. Make sure you go all the way to Santosa for a look.
,,What a View,4.0,,"We took the Cable Car from Mount Faber and wow what a view, if you planning on staying the whole day on Sentosa Island purchasing tickets including the Sentosa Line is definitely worth it, saves you feet and you get to see the Island from above.
One thing to remember, - the staff you let you know anyway on returning to the main land dont forget to get off at the Marina stop, taxi's can be difficult to get from the Mount Faber stop.
Dont forget to smile for those wonderful shots you can get way up high."
,,Reliable and Safe ride from Mount Faber to Sentosa,4.0,,"Due to the rapid built up and expansion of Sentosa, It is a great way to have a bird's eye view of it via taking a cable car ride. About 4 people in a car, therefore it does not feel that crowded, slightly smaller than the cable car of Hongkong Lantau Island going up to the Buddha."
,,It was an okay experience.,5.0,,"Having been there a few times, the cable car has become a sort of boring ride unless you have some ships moving below you. A still good way to reach Sentosa Island."
,,Super expensive but a really lovely experience,5.0,,All we wanted was to take the cable car to Sentosa and back. Unfortunately the min cost was $60 (2 adults)!
,,"Can get pretty crowded, but worth it",5.0,,"The road to Faber Peak is especially scenic when there are clouds looming over the hill. The waiting lines could be pretty long, but this mode of getting to Sentosa Island is way more fun than the Sentosa Express - you could see Universal Studios and Adventure Cove rides too!"
,,Great Views,5.0,,"This was by far the best way to get to the island and see Singapore, the views are magnificent, the ride was very enjoyable"
,,To get back from universal,4.0,,"We used this late at night to get back to the main area of Singapore from Sentosa.

Firstly what a rip off!! There was no simple option of a 1 way ticket. Only ticket was a $22 ticket that does the whole cable car return trip. No child price or senior discount!!!

Anyway we paid the hefty price and it is very nice. You get some good views.

But at $88 for 4 of us it felt like a bit of a rip off. My tip would be to get it in the morning and use it to see all stops."
,,Good way to see a bit of Singapore. ...,4.0,,Get it from vivocity mall....the views of Singapore harbour and sentosa is great.... One of the ways to get to sentosa island and the theme parks....
,,Enjoyable way to see Sentosa,4.0,,"It was an overcast day so we decided to travel by cable car to Sentosa island. Our taxi driver recommended that we take the cable from Mount Faber as it was double the rose for the same price.

It was a great way to arrive in Sebtosa, even if it was raining as arrived! We then took the Sentosa island cable so we could see the island from above.

It isn't cheap as other people have said, but we enjoyed it."
,,Mixed bag of emotions,3.0,,"I loved the experience, the views and how it gets you into Sentosa Island but the cost of the ride isn't really worth it.

Pros:
the views of Singapore
you get a cart to yourself (doesnt matter your group size. we were able to fit 7 inside one cart)
a great alternative way of getting to Sentosa Island

Cons:
the cost/price (the prices was confusing so we ended up paying more than we thought)
Not great if you are afraid of heights
Only lasts 15 - 20 mins."
,,Fun thing to do even if you're mildly afraid of heights,5.0,,"I have a fear of heights. Its not a crippling fear but its pretty bad. But this is like a well oiled machine and I felt perfectly safe inside it.

The view is something else. You get to see the harbour and Sentosa on one side and beautiful greenery when you approach Mt Faber. Make sure you explore the area around the cable car on both stops by foot. Especially on Mt Faber. We almost walked all the way to Henderson waves from there (we had to turn back because of a very heavy storm)

And there is a restaurant and an observation deck of sorts at Mt Faber which has something similar to love locks, but they've used bells instead. Very pretty."
,,Up and away!,5.0,,"Well worth the ride - for the experience and having a bird's eye view of sentosa island. It was a little warm inside the cable car, but it's warm everywhere in Singapore :)"
,,Beautiful view of Singapore waterfront from the sky,4.0,,We traveled to Sentosa from mount Faber. It was an experience to enjoy. Car can comfortably sit 6 adults. They also offer romantic dinner for few of those who wish to experience the same. Night view on return journey was also equally beautiful.
,,Wife brought me on this cable car to conquer my fear of heights!,5.0,,"Took the romantic nighttime cable car ride from Sentosa Island with my wife Arina. Start was great and as we ascended, I was awestruck by the beauty of Singapore at night... until I realized I was over the first column a couple of hundred feet in the air. After that I kinda went in shock...Failed to conquer my fear heights but was glad to have tried! Spectacular sites...long drop."
,,Worth the views,5.0,,We came here as an extension of our Sentosa Island visit and it is worth paying extra for. There is a restaurant if you want to eat there but we came and went quickly.
,,Great views,5.0,,"When visiting places I like to ride the cable cars, even though I am so nervous whilst riding them, but its always worth it for the views. Had a snack in the cafe at the top to appreciate the view for longer."
,,Nice way to travel,4.0,,The Singapore Cable Car is a convenient way to travel to Sentosa Island. Have your camera ready as you will want to take photos as you gently move along.
,,A Bird's Eye View,5.0,,"This is a unique way to travel to Sentosa - very fun! Clearly, if you have height issues this is not for you, but it felt very secure for me and was a wonderful way to get the lay of the land. You can purchase both a round trip ticket and a day pass since there are separate lines on the island to help in getting around. No lines to speak of - got a private car both rides.

The best surprise was how beautiful Mount Faber was! Worth the cab ride just for the view. They have a very cute restaurant that we unfortunately not get to try. There is ""Happiness Bell"" you can ring (also a great photo op). You can also purchase a small personal bell at the gift shop (2 sing - very reasonable), write a personal wish on it, and then tie it with many others to the fence at the view point. It was nice to feel we could leave a little momento."
,,good experience,5.0,,this was good cable car experience.. can say best of all the cable cars i have travelled till date.. connectivity also no issue
,,A must-do if visiting Sentosa,5.0,,The views from the cable car across the whole of Sentosa and the Harbourfront is unmissable. It is slightly pricey but definitely worth doing. An option is to take the monorail to Sentosa and then ride the cable car across and back to the harbour.
,,Great views,4.0,,"We really enjoyed the cable car ride over to Sentosa Island, around Sentosa and up to Mt Faber. We didn't think Sentosa lived up to the tourist hype but really enjoyed using the cable cars to look around and the fabulous views they allowed."
,,Good View From the top,4.0,,"Kids Loved the cable car ride, The bus ride to the Universal Studios was pleasant. It gives access to other attractions also. Friendly staff to give the good customer service experience."
,,Nice way of traveling to Santosa Island,3.0,,"Me and my friend traveled over to Santosa Island by cable car. We bought a package with unlimited travels, and two extra activities on Santosa.

We got a nice view over some parts of Singapore and the Santosa Island. The cable cars felt very safe and modern.
We think it was an okay price, and we went by the cable cars back and forth just because we could."
,,Fantastic views,5.0,,"This is a great attraction - you have to do it, just because you can. I'm not sure what height we got to but my ears started poppng. Fantastic views as you keep climbing up and up. Well worth it."
,,Not a bad way to get to Santosa,4.0,,It is worth once. But not a big fan of doing it more than once. We didn't dine in but the round trip costed us more than what we expected or say it is over priced.
,,good for adventure lovers,4.0,,"well this is just one way ride u go another side by just looking around in the cable car , one can enjoy if love the height"
,,Best mode to visit Sentossa,5.0,,"The 30 minute or so journey from Faber mountain yo Sentosa provides you with one of the greatest view pf the city and the peninsula. The cable car gives 360 degree panoramic view. You can see green mountson, blur sea, cruise ships moving beneath you. Must do in Singapore."
,,Okay but very pricey,3.0,,Same as any other cable car ever ridden but extremely pricey. At $28pp fo a one way ride off the island (told we can come back on) this was way too expensive for what it was. Cheaper ways in and off Sentosa with views that can be obtained for much less money.
,,Great ride and great view,4.0,,"We Tom the Vigo centre- Mount Fabre-sentossa circuitous route. As every where in Singapore , this is also very expensive. But the ride was great.. They use the fourth generation cable cars.
You can get down at Mount Fabre and have a good look at Singapore."
,,This is a MUST for sentosa.,5.0,,This is a MUST for sentosa. Dont worry about spending SGD 33/person for it. It's worth. Makes ur ride to easy across Sentosa island.
,,Aerial view of the harbour and Sentosa,4.0,,Make sure you grab a ticket that does all the lines on Sentosa it is cheaper than buying a ticket each time you travel from each station. Very smooth ride across to the island. A great view of the harbour and buildings
,,Good fun great veiw,5.0,,Was a great experience to travel over the water being able to see everything. It's one of those things you just have to do because you can.
,,Great View!,5.0,,Amazing View and Easy to Travel. Coming from someone like myself who is scared of heights. The cars are safe and make seeing Santosa island fun from above. Will recommend to anyone to do this as part of the day
,,great way to get to sentosa at night,5.0,,"gotta do this one as the lights and views are cool, night time is a show of lights forever as far as the eye can see and daytime gives a whole new perspective to Singapore and the harbour . see Singapore the way birds do.."
,,Well worth the trip,4.0,,This is a great way to get over to sentosa island. Lovely views of the city. Well worth going to the top of Mount Faber. We did it just before sunset. There is a lovely bar to watch the sun go down.
,,Must visit during a Singapore trip,5.0,,I really doubt if there is anyone who goes to Singapore for a holiday and does not go on the cable car. A really well built system and a long cable car ride which goes up quite high at one point. Excellent views of the city and an enjoyable ride to Sentosa.
,,cable car,4.0,,"cable car just like any other cable car in the world, can see some sights of the city and is okay for on time"
,,Nice view and pleasant ride,3.0,,Sentosa and the harbour are so built up that the trip has changed a lot but it is a wonderful smooth ride and a fantastic view.
,,A must,5.0,,Went on this over to Sentosa it was brill. The views are fantastic. There are three sections to this and all well worth doing.
,,Take the ride to Sentosa,4.0,,We took this as our way to get across to Sentosa. It was an amazing introduction to the beautiful beach island and a great way to build the excitement and anticipation among the family for what lied ahead. We took the all day trips. Very little extra cost and then we just knew we could ride all over Sentosa after that.
,,Great way to get over to Sentosa,4.0,,"Great views, a chilled out way to get to Sentosa and back, we went right up to Mount Faber on the return trip, lovely restaurant and bar if you're happy to part with a few $. The 12 year old loved coming in over Sentosa in the morning, definitely helped build the excitement for the planned day ahead."
,,Great way to see Singapore!,5.0,,"We were gifted a full pass for the Singapore Cable Car as a very thoughtful birthday present and we certainly made the most of it! We jumped on and off several times, visiting the adventure parks and then heading out to see Fort Siloso, which was a great surprise! We didn't know about the Fort, so hopped off and spent a few hours walking through. If you like war history it is worth a look!

We hopped back on for our ride back to the city and cab ride to the hotel.

Really recommend it. We found the ticket price good value and made the most of each stop for the day we had."
,,An up above beautiful view of Singapore & Sentosa,5.0,,"This is one of the attractions/rides that I strongly recommend one takes while in Singapore. The Faber Park ride starting from Harborfront to Mt Faber and then to Sentosa is beautiful. While from Vivo City, there are markers to tell you where to board the cable car, but once you enter the Harbour Front towers, it does get a little confusing. So maybe an additional marker there will help. It allows for a beautiful stopover at Mt Faber allowing you lovely views of the harbour. While I had taken tickets for the Sentosa line but I ultimately didn't take that ride."
,,Great Ride,4.0,,Enjoyed a lovely overhead view of Santosa Island.Went up the Mount Faber at the end of our trip but couldnt get any food at the restaurant (Spud and Apron) until six oclock.
,,Great view of Singapore!,4.0,,Nice cable ride from sentosa to harbour front to mt faber and back. Great way to see view of Singapore. Kids love the ride and will be back again if opportunity arises

,,Cable view,5.0,,Actually this is first time in my life to enjoy this type of entertainment. When we are travelling I afraid of safety. But it was conducted with a great company. Every body must try.
,,travelling high,4.0,,This attraction gives you a great birds eye view of the surrounding area and is a photographers delight.
,,Thrill ride,5.0,,"We had been to Sentosa before and were a bit pushed for time so we settled for a return trip with a quick visit to the cable car museum and gift shop. All staff friendly, helpful and courteous. The ride was wonderful but not for the faint-hearted! Great photos but a bit scary when it stopped for a few seconds after we got on. It was soon settled though and we went on to Sentosa. The museum was interesting with facts and figures for the blokes! The cable car made from Lego was new to us and the car used for Special Guests years ago was lovely. For a quick visit we were very pleased. Thoroughly enjoyable!"
,,Must Ride,5.0,,"Must go their through cable car, great experience, enjoy the topographical view of the island, have lots more exciting ride & games."
,,Overprice ride,3.0,,"Kids insist on take the cable car. It got the spectacular view of the sea and santosa island, but not worth the money."

,,Amazing Expirience,5.0,,This is very first expirience of mine beeing at Cable Car. I went 2 Rownds Trip via cable car on 22 July 2016. Very Friendly Staff.
,,Above the Water,5.0,,This is yet another way to reach Singapore's Sentosa Island...Cable car of highest quality...you can watch the amazing buildings and enjoy the ride...!! You can also reach Mt. Faber and have an amazing lunch there!!
,,Good ride,4.0,,"It's the perfect way to travel to sentosa island with views of the forest, universal studio and sentosa. Have a look around before you get in the cable car, mount Faber is at the highest point and the view is fabulous."
,,I LOVE cable cars,5.0,,"On a Sunday morning, we headed to visit Sentosa Island, and chose to take the cable car from Mount Faber. I was lucky enough to be with local friends from Singapore, so we drove their car to the top of mount Faber.
Once you drive past the ticket booth, there was lots of free parking.

We bought an unlimited pass, for both cables, and spent the day getting on and off the cable car. That was fantastic, we got off at the Shangri-La hotel/beach, and at other spots. It was a great way to visit the island.

We finished the day with lunch at the top, which was nice and reasonably priced, considering it's a touristic place. The deserts in the display were very nice"
,,What a ride!,5.0,,Spectacular scenery as you make your way over to Sentosa Island. Use the full extent of the cable car on the main cable way and also over Sentosa Island.
,,Well worth the journey,5.0,,It was a great way to get to Sentosa island. Cost about $77 return. We went over to go the The Hardrock Café. Good days outing.
,,Nice views of sentosa and surroundings,4.0,,It is more worth it to buy the annual pass for unlimited rides and free entry to sentosa. Great views of universal studios.
,,Nice views but quite expensive,3.0,,We bring foreign guests here so we take the cable car 3 or 4 times a year. There have been a few price changes recently and it's now about $120 for 4 adults. This makes it just too expensive for what it is.
,,The only way to get to Sentosa,5.0,,The only fun way to get to Sentosa...nice vistas...on the way home just drive...quicker and easier and no view in the dark anyway.
,,the best way to Sentosa (and back),5.0,,"You've got the option by foot, walk across the bridge. Quite a good walk (less than 1km) and you can take in the sights, and of course capture photos to remember the walk by.
You got the bus and the monorail. Fast and quick.
And you have of course, the CABLE CAR.

A bit more to pay, compared to the other options (walking is the cheapest), but you are sure to be amazed by the sights. The beauty and the uniqueness that is, Singapore/Sentosa.

Try to do the rides on a sunny day. Cos the rain will affect the quality of your photos. Otherwise, enjoy the high rise ride in a safe and enclosed cable car.

Do it at least once."
,,bundled fun,5.0,,this is a part of sentosa experience trip.good view of the city and efficient to see panaroma of the city.
,,Worth a trip,4.0,,"We went to Sentosa for the day and took the cable car there.

It's a good way to travel and get some good pictures on the way.

Our ticket included the Sentosa cable car, and return to the city.

We decided to get the train back for another experience."
,,Spectacular views,5.0,,We purchased the round trip ticket. It was well worth seeing the views from a number of directions. Could hop off and look around at each stop.
,,Exhilirating Experience its heaven indeed!,5.0,,The view of the sights above is breath taking! Spending this special ride with your significant others would define what heaven is.... just being happy!
,,Worth doing once if you're visiting Sentosa,3.0,,The views are very good from the trip to Sentosa and it's a lot less crowded than the Sentosa Express. The advantage of the express is that it's only $4 but I think that the cable car is worth doing once if you're doing a day trip to Sentosa.
,,Great Views,5.0,,"If you want to get a real nice view of Singapore water ways, then take this ride to the island where there's a nice restaurant. Cable car is from Sentosa island, where the universal islands of adventure and casinos and restaurants are there. Its basically a entertainment complex.
It was hot and muggy in June, so weatherwise not a great time."
,,Must Do IF You are going to Sentosa,5.0,,"I wouldn't necessarily recommend the cable car just for the ride, but if you are going to Sentosa Island to spend a few hours/a day there, it's definitely worth it. It's a bit pricey, but they have different packages to include activities on Sentosa and then allow you to ride the cable car all over the island and back to the mainland."
,,Singapore Cable Car,4.0,,Wonder full ride and very exiting. Every one enjoyed traveling in the cable car. Good arrangements made.
,,"Great views, smooth journey to Sentosa",4.0,,"Our family of 4, 2 boys aged 5 & 3 took the cable car ride as part of a birthday celebration. The boys were delighted with the ride, there were nice views of Sentosa as you approached it. The cabin was clean and there was minimal wait as we visited on a weekday. We got the standard Faber Line tickets which are round trip (Harbourfront-Sentosa-Mt Faber) and includes the Sentosa entry. It is not cheap, but we don't take it very often and in this case it was a very nice experience on a special occasion."
,,"Worth a try if you got time, and better with your wife or children",3.0,,"I was recommended to visit Sentosa, and realised the cabel car was the only option to visit both mount peak and the island.
@S$33 it is not cheap, but worthwhile for one off visitor like me. You will get birdviews of nearly the whole city/country and appreciate it more. Is it fantastic? No, but it's quite interesting, especially when you fly over the resorts."
,,Nice Ride,4.0,,"This was enjoyable and the kids loved it.

$88sgd for 2 adults and 1 child + 1 infant but this was the entire cable car ride which you can do in say 1 hour if you don't hop on/off.

Great views of city and Sentosa.

Budget conscious should Catch monorail which is a lot quicker and far cheaper method of transport."
,,great views,4.0,,"a must do when you go to singapore, the views are magical and it gives a great look at how busy the country is"
,,"Great views, highly expansive",4.0,,"A good way to go to Sentosa from Mount faber that offers great views on Sentosa Island and Singapore Harbour. It is highly expensive. If in search of foto opportunities, a good time is just before sunset. Photographers, take into consideration that the cable car has open windows only on the right-hand side."
,,dont try it from the begining point,5.0,,"if you cant walk a lot and climb hills in a wet weather ,then don't try to ride it from the mount faber point , simply enter it through a building next to vivo city shopping center (bay front station from the yellow line(MRT)).
I really enjoyed it as its passing by the sea and goes to santosa island , you would see touristic type ships parking under the cable and you the island is a very nice place to see it from the above , I really recommend it ."
,,Scary (if you're afraid of heights) but DEFINITELY a MUST DO!,5.0,,"Went to Universal Studios over the weekend and chose to travel from Harbour point to Sentosa via cable car.

I'm afraid of heights hence the title (I didn't think it was going to be that high) but after overcoming it after 5 mins or so, the view and experience is well worth it.

SGD 33 per head, roundtrip from Harbour Point to the Merlion point. (Seems pricey, but I thought well worth the experience)"
,,Fun ride to Santosa,4.0,,"To travel to Santos, you can either take train (Santosa express) or cable car.
We took the cable car (both ways ticket)
Its great view, especially in the morning to watch the view of the bay & top view of Santos island (Universal studio, SEA aquarium) from the top.
While coming back, the night view was not that much fun"
,,"Car in the sky...eeeek, but I did it!",5.0,,"I did think twice about going on the cable car and I must say I was the only one in my ""car"" as we traveled along. I did give myself a serious talking to to rationalise my fear versus the absolutely amazing views I was getting on this very safe vessel in the sky. I think if I had other people in the car with me I would have been chatting to them and it would have taken my mind off the height, the cable etc. Would I do it again? Absolutely, it was an amazing experience, so please don't let your fear stop you, so worth it when you arrive at the other end, in my case it was Sentosa Island, I left from Mt Faber, had a wander around and then got back on and headed back to the Mountain. fabulous experience... don't think about it, just DO IT!!!"
,,Excellent experience,4.0,,"First time cable car experience for kids and they loved it. We took faber line and sentosa line combo and it was worth it.
Although we got the ticket online, we had to stand in the ticket queue to get the tickets printed. Our whole trip was pretty much booked online and this was the only place where we were made to stand in the queue nonetheless. Request the authorities to please at least have a separate counter for people who have online bookings."
,,Great Way to Get to Sentosa,5.0,,This is truely the only way to travel to Sentosa Island. The view is spectacular every which way you look. We were allowed a care for our sole use. Had to laugh when a peacock nearly flew into our vehicle! Worth every cent.
,,Good value and lots of fun.,5.0,,The cable cars give you a great view and it's a great way to get to and around Sentosa island. You can do all the trips twice for and extra dollar which would be fun if you have kids and plenty of time. It wasnt very busy so we had cable cars to ourselves (they hold eight people) which made it easy for taking lots of photos.
,,Another excellent experinece,5.0,,"Whole family (incl. 2 kids 7 and 9 years) enjoyed this way of getting on to Sentosa island. Bit scary because of height, but allows you to get an idea about what to expect on the island. Very good view of the commercial harbour. Gives u an idea of the scale of commerce taking place in Singapore harbor.
Yet again, bit pricy , but had to get used to that in this city."
,,Great view,5.0,,Had a wonderful time going over to Sentosa and back to Singapore. Purchased the ticket that also gave access to the other cable car which runs cross ways on Sentosa.
,,great views !,3.0,,"wish it was longer, kids will love it...good experience over all. the photo op is quite abrupt, can be done well"
,,unlimited rounds,4.0,,"I booked cable car for Sentosa visit, With unlimited round pass. As I was traveling solo, I got whole car for my own. It has first 2 stations from city harbor front ,which passes over the sea and then further 3 stations on the Sentosa Island connecting Siloso beach. Last car operates till 9 PM. I did multiple rounds over sea and the forest of the Island thanks to my unlimited pass and enjoyed the same thoroughly.
Must do and try and go for unlimited…… as I am sure ….you get enough of a single round."
,,A great view of Singapore,5.0,,"A great ride across the city, fascinating views. I'd avoid having an expensive beer in the restaurant complex."
,,A great experiance,4.0,,"One of the best ways to reach Sentosa island. The cars provide a great view. There are two lines, one that takes to Sentosa and the other one which is inside Sentosa island."
,,Loved our trip across on the cable car,3.0,,"Used the Cable Car to get to Sentosa/Universal Studios. Great views. Only issue is at the end of the day, at dark, it too a long time for staff to find us a taxi to take us back to our hotel"
,,"Fun,",5.0,,The cable car goes through the middle of a building. Its really high up so you get great views of all parts of Singapore.
,,My visit,4.0,,We took the harbour font cable car lane which brings us to Sentosa view was breath taking you can see from the whole view of Sentosa island. It was my first time ride a cable car and i enjoyed it must try attraction
,,Go for it for a perfect view,5.0,,One can Take a cable car from Harbour Front to Sentosa and from Sentosa to Harbourfront. There are 2 options available. From Mt. Faber via harbour front to Sentosa and from Sentosa to Mt. Faber via Haarbour front. This is definetely going to be a eye catchy experience. You can go to Sentosa through Cable Car in the mng and come back in the eve so that you can get the view of Morning and Eve.
,,one of first experience,4.0,,"This was my first ever experience on a cable car, had many more rides after that.As a first timer probably this is one of the best cable car ride to have, its safe the view is cool."
,,Perfect view,5.0,,"The cable cars give you a great view of Sentosa Island, but they are kind of expensive. It's worth it to do the packages that they have. The cable cars do not have AC, but stayed comfortable in summer."
,,Good Experience,4.0,,"I think it is one of the most convenient way to reach Sentosa Island. It was a good ride and enables us to see the glimpse of whole Sentosa Island. There are other ways to reach Sentosa Island but first time visitors must opt this cable ride in order to see the whole of the Island.

One day pass is a good option for first time travelers."
,,Nice cable cars during off-peak season,4.0,,"During off-peak season, we had our own private cable car - very nice. Otherwise, it is quite expensive and not worth the ride if it is crowded."
,,wow experience,5.0,,the awesome cabel car starts from area and takes you over from water and roads and then reaches to sentosa island. really a must ride in the cable car.
,,family trip cable car - very good,4.0,,for santosa we picked singapore cable car . nice experience but due crowed and rush faced humidity and hot . overall very good.
,,Fabulous but not for the faint of heart,5.0,,This iss a must do in Singapore. It was a bit hard to find but worth it. It was sunny beautiful and really really really high. It cost me about $25 Canadian to go across to Sentosa Island. It was spectacular.
,,CABLE RIDE,5.0,,"Its a long cable car ride on the sky for almost a kilometer. Good to see, the view and the nature looks beyond expectations."
,,Great day out with magnificent views!,5.0,,Took a taxi up to Faber Point and bought a combined ticket for the Singapore Cable Car and Sentosa Island cable car. The latter is fairly new I believe! No senior tickets! Lovely sunny day which gave beautiful views! We were only a couple but had our own car. It was mid week and not too busy so they didn't push the max of 8 into a car!
,,Ride the sky,5.0,,This is one of the best cable car rides we have done the views are great and the cost is relatively cheap. Put it on your bucket list when you visit Singapore.
,,view,4.0,,view from the cable car is amazing.best way to see singapore .you can get the view of most of the attractions from above.
,,Great views,5.0,,We bought the one day round trip ticket which covered both cable cars. We started at Harbourfront Station and travelled to Sentosa Island via Mount Faber to take in the views. We did a non-stop trip on the Island branch later in the day which was a good way of looking round the island: we had mainly walked at the eastern end of the island and been to the beach there so the cable car allowed us a view of the west of the island. At the end of the day we used the final portion of our ticket to travel back to Harbourfront. It wasn't the cheapest way of getting to Sentosa (you can walk over the bridge) but we did get some great views and it was certainly a fun way to travel.
,,Gigantic queue at Mt Faber,3.0,,"The cable car ride is a highlight of a Singapore visit but timing is everything! When the tour buses arrived the queue at Mt Faber snaked out of the building, down the stairs and across the back of the car park (so my wife and I walked down the ""mountain"" to the middle station). Nice walk though."
,,Pre cruise stopover,5.0,,"A really great & fun way to see more of Singapore, even though it was raining when we visited. Easily accessible via the MTR system."
,,"Easy, Fast and Afforable",4.0,,"To get to the cable car from the train station, is to alight at habourfront. Tickets can be purchased in 1/2 rounds or even unlimited. (for singaporean, check the promotions online because they have partnered up with local banks etc.) Also, it is the easiest way to get to Mount Faber/Faber Peak for a meal."
,,Superb Views !!,4.0,,I thought it would be just another Cable car ride and there wouldn't be anything exciting about it..but I was wrong as the views are wonderful..it was raining that day which added to experience..
,,A wonderful experience,5.0,,Riding the cable car was a great experience. You could chose this option for a one way ride to get to sentosa.
,,"Nice view, great ride but ....",4.0,,Its enjoyable and likable but be well aware of the tourist hoardes which descend from mount fabia....i am not talking a bus or two. One minutes you could be enjoying a nice ride with a few people .... next station it can become sardine city when dozens of tourist buses roll in dumping tourists of and generating hour long wait times.
,,great experience for first timers,5.0,,"the cable car climbs to a pretty good height and then climbs down. There is a river/sea below it and view is awesome, little scary (to me) but a great experience"
,,Exciting ride,4.0,,"Cable car is the most expensive way to get to Sentosa, but it is recommended to ride it once, just for the experience. It provides scenic view of the harbourfront, and overlooks the ResortsWorld Sentosa on the way."
,,Cable View!!!!,5.0,,"One of the best ways to get an aerial view of Singapore, the Singapore Cable Car provides a 360 degree panoramic view of city’s best attractions, including the harbor, Sentosa and the skyline itself.

Unlike other cable car rides, the impressive view is only part of the adventure. The cableway system arrives at a stop 106 meters, or 347 feet, above sea level at the peak of Mount Faber. Here, there are a number of food and beverage locations--the Black Opal, Empress Jade, Moonstone and Sapphire--as well as rides for the kids and a souvenir shop.

Tickets aboard the cable car grants you access to the continent’s first ever cable car museum, which contains a full history of the cable car system, life-sized models of cable cars used in the past as well as a life-sized replica made out of Legos."
,,excellent experience,5.0,,"the cable car is one of its kinds experience with effortless and seamless management , great views speed slow enough to enjoy the photography of the view and fast enough to reach your destination in time."
,,Do not waste your time,1.0,,"This is a very expensive form of travel and there are better ways to see Sentosa Island like walking the amazing boardwalk from VivoCity to the Island (which is free, undercover, has traveletors for those that are lazy and keeps you dry from the rain). The cable car is very pricy, so if you are looking for an experience of a cable car than this is good, but does not need to be on the list of things to do in Sentosa."
,,Cable car with Helicopter view,4.0,,Cable car experience to visit Sentosa island is worth remembering. You have to pay for cable car ride to Sentosa. You can have full view from top of Singapore . Worth enjoying during Singapore visit.
,,Amazing views,5.0,,"Beautiful trip to Mt Faber anad Sentosa Island. We spent most of our time walking around the many tracks on Mt Faber, such a beautiful place. The trip over to Sentosa was lovely as well."
,,Great views,5.0,,"As we only had a short time in Singapore, we travelled on the cable car to Sentosa Island and back, as well as the cable car on Sentosa Island itself. The ride was smooth and the view spectacular. The view from Mount Faber was the best part of the ride, as there were no other viewing points as high on the cable car stops."
,,Great way to get to Sentosa Island,5.0,,"I travelled one way on cable car to island and returned by bus. Although cable cars not air conditioned enough breeze comes inside to make it comfortable travelling. Great way to see overview of amusement park. Arrives in good area for beach access, aquarium, Madame Tussaud and 3D cinema, along with many food outlets."
,,The Singaporean Rpope trick,4.0,,"Singapore has its many attractions. The Cable car is one such. While you go up in the FLyer you see most of Singapore from the Height in one place. Traversing the southern parts of singapore on a cable car is a delightful experience for young and old. Seeing the large harbour when you go from Faber peak to sentosa you see the lovely Vivo mall and the hArbourfront and then the waterworld and sentosa island with its Universal studios and the ""papa"" merlion! It can get a trifle hot in the car yet its worth the trip. You get off at the Merlion plaza and trot into Madamme Tussads. If you are in for a little more excitement, you can drape a Burmese Python onto your neck from the Maharashtrian Dude outside Tussads. Enjoy the ride."
,,Great views,5.0,,"Such a fun way to see the island from a birds eye view! The park below offers water attractions, the Shangri-La resort offers wonderful accommodations for weary travelers! Beautiful photo opportunities of the financial district from afar!"
,,Big Buddah,5.0,,"Had a great day. We arranged a tour from our hotel. We were picked up by bus and driven to the cable cars, took about 20 minutes.Great view going across to the Big Buddah, if you are scared of heights, i wouldnt recommend this attraction. Once across we were picked up by another bus and driven up to the Buddah. You can walk up the 238 stairs but because it had been raining for safely reasons we were driven. Stunning! Then we visited the local Monastry. You cannot take any pictures inside! Lots of shops, lots to look at. Then we were driven to a local Fishing Village that goes back around 600 years! Bit smelly but very interesting seeing how they dry fish etc. We were then driven to the Ferry and taken back to Hong Kong. From there we had to make our own way back to the otherside, Kowloon. Good day all round"
,,Great way to spend half hour,5.0,,"Not much to say really, it's a cable car. Cool views of the city skyline. About $18 (£10) for a half hour ride to one side then the other without getting off. You can of course exit at either end and spend time in those areas - I think the ticket costs more for that, not sure. There is a theme park & beach one end but I didn't go there. Would do again and stop off there for the day."
,,high,4.0,,this is very high and the glass bottoms can be a little bit of a fright for the most hardy of travellers. worth a visit as long as your very very ok with hights
,,More fun than expected! Highly recommended.,5.0,,"I'm not one who likes to go to high buildings or hill tops just for the view. But we got tickets from our hotel package with Rasa Sentosa and decided to utilise them. It was surprisingly great!

Next to Rasa Sentosa is the new Siloso Point Station. We started from here and did the new Sentosa Line. After that, we alighted at Imbiah Station and walked a short distance to the Sentosa Station and did a round trip on the Faber Line.

Compared to Singapore Flyer, the views you get here are more varied and interesting. On the Sentosa Line, you see Siloso Beach and the coast line and move on to lush vegetation passing several attractions, including the new skywalk to the Fort. On the Faber Line, you get to see Adventure Cove and maybe bits of Resorts World (I'm not sure), the Resorts World Beach Resort and the Keppel Bay area. It's particularly nice to get a bird's eye view of Adventure Cove. People afraid of heights may find the stretch crossing the sea a little scary.

We went at 1 p.m. so the cable car felt like a sauna when it got to open sea. Thankfully there was a nice breeze on the return trip. Highly recommended to go before it gets too hot or in the evening to catch the sunset.

I can't say if we will pay full price for this ride but I thoroughly enjoyed the experience!"
,,A must do...for the views,5.0,,"Great fun at least once. To make it easy, when you buy tickets you have a choice between the Mt Faber line and the Sentosa line or both...get both! it's $33 Singapore dollars per person. This allows you to go up to Mount Faber, down to Sentosa and across Sentosa. It can all seem quite confusing when you are in the line looking at tickets."
,,Panaromic views of sentosa & mount faber,5.0,,"Always enjoy this cable car ride although it can be quite thrilling at times when the wind blows. Enjoy the paranomic views of Sentosa, harbour front & mount faber. Do stop over at both Mt Faber & Sentosa to enjoy the views. For the cable car rides you can continue your journey within Sentosa on their newest inter-island cable cars. Definitely worth taking when going to Sentosa."
,,Everyone should take the time and enjoy the view as they make their way to Sentosa Island,4.0,,Everyone should take the time and enjoy the view as they make their way to Sentosa Island. Then cut loose on the roller coasters and the luge.
,,Very Good Experiene,5.0,,"Very nice view ,i love this ride ,for first timer do not look below look up and after few minutes of ride you can feel like you are flying like a bird"
,,Nice views but quite overpriced for a short journey! :),3.0,,"It's worth travelling once on the Singapore Cable Car to Sentosa for the lovely views. However, I do find the ticket prices rather overpriced for a relatively short journey from Harbourfront station to Sentosa that only takes a few minutes. It costs 33S$ for a return journey or 43S$ for unlimited rides all day. If you get the unlimited ticket, I recommend riding up to Mount Faber as well for a stunning view of Harbourfront and Sentosa. Be careful during the weekends as the queues for the cable car can get super long. It's probably better to travel to Sentosa first in the morning, then head to Mount Faber in the afternoon to avoid the queues.

I would also recommend travelling on the cable car only when it is a clear day as the rain would obstruct a great deal of your view. If it is raining during your travels, then the Sentosa Express is another speedy option priced at only 4S$ for a return journey.

The unlimited ticket option allows you to redeem a free souvenir magnet from the Singapore Cable Car gift shop, but make sure when you hand over your ticket stub to the staff that you get it back after redeeming your complimentary gift. The gift shop staff took away my ticket stub and I didn't think much of it at the time since I had the blue wristband on me that they give you as well at the Harbourfront ticket office. However, later on when I wanted to get on the cable car at Siloso station, the person checking the tickets said you need to show the ticket stub in addition to the blue wristband. I had to go all the way back to the gift shop and ask for the ticket stub that the staff member had forgotten to give back to me. Do keep your ticket stub with you at all times! :)"
,,A one of a kind experience,4.0,,"Bring a camera along if you are the kind to want to take photographs! Go during sunset is best - that was when we went.
I planned a birthday dinner in the sky for my hub's bday (you can do that too if you want the experience!)"
,,Grand entry into Sentosa,5.0,,We took the cable car to Sentosa from Singapore City. It is very long and you get a clear view of the Universal Studios from the top. I would recommend take the cable car to get into Sentosa and get a car/van to pick you up when you plan to return from Sentosa
,,Amazing view,5.0,,Caught taxi it Mt Faber from city. The ride down in the cable car is very smooth and a magnificent view. Worth the money paid.
,,Once is enough!,3.0,,"The Singapore Cable car is one of those things it is worth doing once, but I would suggest finding an alternative way back. It is very high in places and is actually quite a short trip across to the island where you can switch to another cable car at an additional cost, which is actually quite high to begin with, in fact you can get a low cost airline ticket for less!!! - and travel a lot further, it is certainly not the most cost effective form of transport. Only do it on a clear day."
,,Head for heights...,5.0,,"A brilliant way to see the views. Excellent value for money. There is plenty to do and see, a good experience"
,,Visit to Sentosa,3.0,,"I was very underwhelmed with the whole experience. The cable car goes over it two stages where you can split your journey if you like. It goes over a bit of the harbour and a cruise liner which there is always one there.
On the way back we got off at the half way point and went shopping at the new huge mall - it really is worth a visit - although having all the top end of fashion outlets - there are heaps of other good shops which do not demand top dollar."
,,Views from Singapore Cable Car,4.0,,I did the round trip on the cable car going first on the Mount Faber Line then going on the next leg to Harbour Front Station and then on the Sentosa Line to Silosa Point Station. The Bell of Happiness can be seen (and rung!) at Mount Faber. There are hundred of small bells with inscriptions from those who have visited and/or married there. The return journey on the final leg from Silosa Point was rather scary when winds plus thunder and lightning (directly overhead!) started and I was alone in one of the cars! Still an enjoyable trip.
,,fantastic view,5.0,,"We took the cable car to Sentosa Island. It gave us the best view of the Harbour and the surrounding areas, we took some amazing photos unfortunately I have not loaded them as yet so I can't include them with this review.
If you go to Sentossa Island then the cable car is a must, it travels from the mainland to Sentossa Island and then from one side of Sentossa to the other.
Just be wary that if you scared of heights this may cause you some concern as the cable car is enclosed in a glass case and provides 360 degree views and also you are about 50 metres plus above the ground. But if you don't have a fear of heights then I highly recommend it make sure that you camera is fully charged as you will get some fantastic shots of Singapore."
,,Sentosa Island,2.0,,This was our biggest disappointment in Singapore. The cable car was very expensive if you only wanted a one way ticket (not available) $GD50. Now you can walk to the island from the MRT. The island has changed into a Disney world and not for the better. The old Sentosa kept some of the jungle and charm of the island.
,,Fun way to reach Sentosa,4.0,,The cable car starts from Faber's park and goes to Sentosa Island giving you s wonderful view of Singapore including the Singapore Harbour. A must do activity in Singapore.
,,"Stunning Views, Comfortable and Clean",4.0,,"Go for the Singapore Cable Car+Sentosa Cable car, its more value for money. I would say the best time to go would be around 6.30- 7 when its beginning to get dark and the lights are coming on so you can get both views - in daylight and with night lights on. If you are booking online, there is a separate counter where you need to get your tickets from."
,,Great Views but Hot and humid,2.0,,"There's nothing wrong with the cable car service as the infrastructure is well maintained and managed. However given the hot and humid weather of Singapore the ride wasn't exactly a fun experience as it does get stuffy and hot inside the car.

They do have mini fans to help keep things cool but it doesn't really help much given the heat and weather of Singapore.

The only good thing about the cable car is that it offers a bird eye view of Sentosa island and also it's attraction which is something for first time visitors.

However I would suggest to take the train option to sentosa island as it may be a better and economical choice compared to the cable car."
,,Family visit,4.0,,"We used the cable car to go across to Sentosa, it was easy to find the station and we got on a cable car easily without a wait, they did tell us that you will need to take the train back (which is free) if the weather turns bad but we were able to go there and back on the cable car. When you arrive you can either take an internal cable car on sentosa island or you can walk down to universal world etc or take a free bus subtle (which gets extremely crowded)"
,,Great views,5.0,,"The Singapore Cable car is a great way to access Sentosa Island, it only takes a few minutes and offers spectacular views along the way, please note if you are scared of heights ( which I am ) it is scary particularly when you approach the 80 metre high station, I was so scared , but I managed to survive, I would definitely recommend as it lands you in a good central location at Sentosa as opposed to getting a bus there"
,,Great views,4.0,,"Amazing views of Singapore and Sentosa when arriving by cable cart. However, we decided to take the cable car up to the very top to find everything was shut and the paths away from the station blocked by a chain meaning there was nothing to do. A fun way to arrive in Sentosa."
,,The views are amazing,5.0,,"This trip, which is extremely well priced, allows you a birds eye view of singapore and the lush vegetation that abounds among the spread of development. The camera doesn't stop clicking on each leg. Buy a two line pass (Sentosa and Mt Faber) for great value. You can jump off at each station and explore each location then jump back on to the next station. A wonderful experience."
,,The only way to fly to Sentosa,5.0,,Nothing better than jumping on the Singapore Cable Car to get to Sentosa Island. The views of the harbour are great plus you get an excellent idea of the layout of the park.
,,Good experience and beautiful sunset views,4.0,,"not so overpriced Cable car which now runs in 2 lines, Mount Faber to Sentosa and Sentosa to the beach. both views are good and the best part is sunset while riding the beach line. Beautiful :)"
,,One way for you to Sentosa,5.0,,"If you plan to Sentosa Island, there are several ways to get there. By walking from ViVo City, take a monorail, driving or cable car."
,,Great Views,5.0,,I would say its a must do when in Singapore. I think the earlier you go the better. Kids will love it.
,,Best way to and from Sentosa,5.0,,"The Singapore cable Car is a thrilling way to reach Sentosa. It takes you over the beutiful marina, gives a bird's eye view over the Singapore port, cruise station and other places in and around Sentosa. The thrill and excitement once you are inside the cable car is unimaginable. They are beautifully maintained, clean and well ventilated. When they go up the rope and down again, there is a sure push of adrenaline and this ride is worth every penny spent."
,,night view is good,5.0,,"Singapore’s cable car system links Mount Faber to Sentosa island, and is a fantastic way to both see the island and reach the dining and entertainment complex that now occupies its peak."
,,Birds eye view,4.0,,"The cable car from Faber peak to Sentosa island gives you a great view of the resorts, water parks and beaches etc as you go across to the island."
,,A must do when in Singapore,5.0,,Great way to travel over to Sentosa. The cars were updated a few years ago and are quite comfortable to travel in. Great views. Que at Mount Faber was long.
,,If you're scared of heights don't do it!,4.0,,"Good view of Sentosa and the city. Not the cheapest attraction or the easiest to understand the pricing, but interesting views."
,,Great views,5.0,,We took the cable car from Harbourtown firstly to the Mount Faber look-out. There is not much to do here so we took a photo and then got back on the cablecar. This time we went passed Harbourtown and across to Sentosa. It was lovely to see this part of Singapore from the air.
,,Beautiful Landscape Views,5.0,,"I've been on this twice now with tourists. It's really a great view. It's a big pricey at about $25 a person. It gets you a great ride to Sentosa. And then there are 2 other cable cars you can ride while on the island with good views too. It's great to be in the cable cars. Sentosa is great to see but the cable car ride is better for me than actually being on sentosa. While I don't think this is a must do, it's one that you should consider. If money isn't an issue for you, then definitely do it."
,,Swinging in Air,3.0,,Rode the Cable car from Marina Bay to Silosa Beach and back. Saw the Green jungles and Skyscrapers simultaneously on one side and the Sea with ships on the other side.
,,high view...,4.0,,Fun way to move up in the air. Must do if u are going with kids. give s a great view of the bay and singapore.
,,Amazing views,5.0,,"The price is reasonable, it is not so crowdy and you will have almost 20 minutes of wonderful views."
,,Short cut to sentosa,4.0,,"Worth a ride to Sentosa, though short one, bypassing the traffic. Gives you nice preview of Sentosa island layout, allows planning you theme park journey."
,,Vertigo,5.0,,Thought I'd died a hundred time. What an experience. View astounding . Have the choice of going bottomless. Only the brave. Worth the money
,,Beautiful Views,4.0,,"Loved watching the sun set over Singapore as we took a trip back from Mount Faber! As it got darker the cars started twinkling...
The cars themselves are surprisingly sturdy, don't sway too much and travel at a good pace letting you see everything but not letting you hang there so long you get bored."
,,"Great View, not much else",4.0,,View of city and harbor is great. I found the island to be a bad version of Atlantic City. A bunch of amateurish overpriced attractions and bad food. Worth riding over and back for the photo ops.
,,breath taking ride,4.0,,My children immensely enjoyed the ride. I think this was the highlight of visiting Sentosa island. The cable cars appeared well maintained.
,,Great views of Sentosa,4.0,,"We really enjoyed seeing the views from the cable cars, a great way to see the island and a much needed little break walking in the heat. Some of my friend we're not so relaxed as they didn't like heights but looking back they are glad they plucked up the courage! We didn't experience any queues but was told that usually there can be lengthy queues."
,,Lovely experience,4.0,,Enjoyed the journey to Sentosa. the top level views gives full picture of the island! Do visit the cable car museum as well
,,Amazing Views,4.0,,We used the cable car to get to Sentosa Island. Got some amazing photos of the city. At one point we seemed to go down to go back up again to the tower. Well worth the fare
,,Great view if you don't have vertigo,5.0,,If you are not afraid of heights then this is a great way to go to Sentosa Island plus getting a great scenic arial view of that part of Singapore.
,,"nothing great as such , just for a ggod view",3.0,,this is soecially for sentosa where you should visit in the morning itself and do not opt for those half day sentosa tours with one way cable ride there is lot to explore in sentosa
,,Great Views from cable car and Toilet,4.0,,Start your cable car car ride on Mt Faber commencing with a stop at the Loo whether you need to go or not!! The view is amazing.Cable car views fantastic and the approach to Sentosa island. Hadn't realised how large the island was.
,,Excellent Ride,5.0,,"It is a great attraction and gives an excellent view of Singapore City. And it connects Singapore to Sentosa, which again is an Island of fun. Very nice concept"
,,"Really amazing views, beautiful!",4.0,,Its one of the amazing way to get transfer to Sentosa Island while enjoying some really great views. Our little one also loved it so much that we used it 3 times and 2 days. A must for everyone while visiting Singapore.
,,Bird's Eye View,5.0,,The best way to commute to the Sentosa Island is to get a Singapore Cable Car ride. You can view almost complete Singapore. The night view is even more mesmerizing.
,,What a view,5.0,,Getting on to this cable car only made Singapore even more beautiful.dont miss it for anything else ...
,,brilliant view of Singapore,5.0,,"If you're not afraid of heights then you simply must go on this ride across the bay. Great fun, and good value for money"
,,excellent ride,5.0,,"oh! the cable car ride took my breath out, I actually have a phobia for heights, but still I stepped into this cable car ride and I thoroughly enjoyed it, it was little scary at first, I had my support system with me, my family they helped come out of the fear and I could enjoy the scenic beauty around Singapore from the cable car. next time I visit Singapore I 'll not miss to take another ride. every one should go on this ride and enjoy."
,,Singapore Cable Car,5.0,,"Most people think of these types of sites as tourist traps and to some degree, they are. But they afford a view of the island that is unparalleled. The view is gorgeous and sweeping."
,,Great views all the way to Sentosa Island,4.0,,The cable cars were a great way of getting over to Sentosa Island. You can stop half way at the Harbour Front building where there is a big shopping center. The cable cars were very clean with a narrator on the speakers all the way.
,,Holiday 2016,4.0,,"Take the return ticket from Mt Faber down to santosa island once there you can go on the Sentosa cable go to the west side first and go up on the skywalk which takes you to the gun placements and look out forts the were used during world war 2 a lot of history there after you can relax on the beach . Then jump back on the cable car again and to the east end to the other attractions .there is also a monorail that runs north to south that takes you some more attractions if you don't like the cable car there are different number buses that take to all the attractions and is free , but remember when you take the cable car back up come off at Harbour Town where there's taxis and buses to bring back to the centre of Singapore This is because there's is no taxis or buses at the top of Mt Faber to take you back done to the city centre."
,,See the whole Sentosa while sitting in these high quality cable cars,4.0,,"These cable cars take you from Harbour Front to Sentosa Island. Its a good ride, comfortable, not noisy and safe. You can sit back and take a look around or can click pictures from various angles. Must do !"
,,Not as scary as it looks,5.0,,"We took the cable cars from Faber Rd to Sentosa Island. The trip takes about 15 minutes each way and costs $29 for a return trip. You have to buy return. It was VERY high but also very secure and safe. Cable cars are new and modern and airconditioned and best of all, they LOCK! 100% worth going as the views are spectacular. One thing to mention. We did find it hard to get a taxi from Faber back to the city and had to wait for at least 20 mins. We were in a rush so that was a bit of an issue. Perhaps book a car or start and finish your journey in Sentosa."
,,Great View & Ride to Sentosa!,4.0,,"Once the weather is good, this is a nice short ride over to Sentosa. I don't think I would do this if it was raining as the experience may not be as pleasant. Hassle free & easy with a great view. I would not do cable car in other cities so this was a good cable car experience."
,,Good experince!,4.0,,Our daughter enjoyed it ! We did as well. We just took one loop of ride without getting off at all. Just enjoyed the view.
,,Good value,5.0,,"Definitely recommend purchasing the unlimited cable car pass with three other Sentosa attractions (approx. $80S). The cable car is easy to find from the MRT station. We visited the SEA aquarium, the butterfly and insect park as well as the buffet lunch at Faber Peak. The views from Faber Peak into Sentosa are spectacular. I'm not a fan of heights but I still appreciated the scenery. There is a free bus shuttle from Sentosa station down into Resort World that comes every 10 minutes. The buffet lunch was a highlight with a great diversity of food on offer. Our group consisted of six persons (age range 4-61 years old) and we all enjoyed this outing."
,,overpriced,1.0,,"There are so many other ways that you can get views of the city, why waste your money here, yes it is unique, but is it worth it?"
,,Great views,4.0,,We rode both lines and had a car to ourselves the whole time so really enjoyed the experience - great views and a great way to get to and see Sentosa. Their admin is their weak point - The line for tickets at Faber Hill was long and slow with the one cashier having to explain their very confusing pricing options to every customer - this really let things down. But when we got up to get on there were no crowds at all and heaps of the cars were empty. Weirdly though when we came back in the late afternoon there was no queue for tickets but a huge queue to get on. Also at every station you have to find and show your tickets. My advice would be to buy your tickets beforehand so you suss out a good deal and don't have to wait.
,,Daunting,5.0,,My husband and I went on the cable car and wow it s so high. It was a bit daunting initially but once we relaxed and took in the views it was truly spectacular. The photos we took ate amazing.
,,Well managed,5.0,,"Amazing view of Sentosa, clear beaches and you could even spot the dolphins at the underwater world!. It is a must ride."
,,Way to Sentosa,5.0,,This is a cable car ride from Mount Faber (the highest point in Singapore) to Sentosa and back. There are cable car rides in Sentosa island too.
,,What a scenic view!,5.0,,"When spending some days in Singapore, you shouldn't leave without visiting Sentosa. And this is probably the best way to get there: by cable car. Fantastic views."
,,good ride,5.0,,The views from the cable car are awesome..specially when you near the Merlion statue..the cable cars are safe to ride in and lots of fun
,,A lovely entry in to the island,5.0,,The cable car ride is awesome and very professional. You get a lovely view of the city and the island. The last time i had been here they had a theme for all the cable cars
,,Nice Experience,4.0,,Travelling to Sentosa Island by Cable Car is a nice experience. The cable cars though move slowly but it gives you enough time to watchout the outside beauty of the coast.
,,Riding up high,5.0,,"We took the cable car from Mount Faber down to the island and opted to get the added extras which included rides on the Sentosa line too. What a great view all the way from the top to the bottom. It was nice to have the cabin to ourselves as well and not have to share with anyone. Good photo opportunities and I should imagine it must be great at night with all the lights. At the end of the day we took the cable car back up to Mount Faber, walked to Henderson Waves and then caught the MRT home. A great fun mode of transport to Sentosa."
,,Cable Car over the Cruise terminal and on to the island of Sentosa,5.0,,"Rode the cable car to Faber Mountain terminal from cruise terminal station, walked around there, then took tram over to Sentosa island, and then back. Great views, and the night ride is also good."
,,Enjoy the experience!,5.0,,"If holidaying in Singapore this is a must do because it takes the family into a whole new world of fun that includes beaches, universal studios and a birds eye view of the city. Allocate a whole day to take it all in."
,,Great View,5.0,,"We enjoyed cable car a lot. It was short but we were able to view complete Santosa which we would have missed otherwise, so It was a good experience for the new people."
,,Short ride!,4.0,,"You can view all of Sentosa and a bit of the city by riding the cable car, just a short ride though. We rode during daytime. I think it's much nicer to do this at night."
,,The view!,5.0,,"Even though this is the most expensive transport available for the Sentosa island, we loved it so much. The unlimited day pass for both of the lines is pretty expensive, but I still think it was worth it. Watching the sunset from the gondola took us away."
,,Amazing first time experience,5.0,,"We had been to Santosa and used cable car to travel from Harbourfront station to Santosa or you could also take Sentosa Express at HarbourFront MRT station located at VivoCity Level 3 Mall. For Cable car booked online you need to collect the ticket at 3rd Building from Vivocity Mall. You can check that at the information counter at the mall.

This being our first experience in Cable care, we all enjoyed it to the core and my kid just loved it. Unforgettable experience for us."
,,very high and convenient,5.0,,Its nice.. but too pricy.. we done this because we wants to go to sentosa island... but it has very beautifull view
,,Skip it !! Chairlift at Sky Luge was more exciting,2.0,,"We did this trip after 12 yrs mainly for our 10.5 yr old son.
The cable car ride no longer has many tourists queueing up for it. Most tend to take the FREE Sentosa Express (Monorail). The cable car ride gives aerial views of Sentosa but nothing exciting. The chairlift at Sky Luge Sentosa beats this.
The ride from Mt Faber Peak to Harbour Front is nothing exciting but comes bundled in the tkt price. No aircon but has battery operated tiny fans. Expensive !! And no refunds ! We booked the combination tkt - Sentosa Line along with Mt Faber line. We were unable to use the Sentosa Line but we were disappointed to find out about their no refund policy :-("
,,Good one time activity,4.0,,We used this to travel to Sentosa sight seeing locations. Our family enjoyed the ride. Awesome view from the top.
,,Beautiful night flight,4.0,,We used the cable car during our return night journey from Sentosa island to mainland. The cable cars have been replaced by sleeker and more modern designs compared to our previous visit in 2008. Even during night time the view is breath-taking. Though exterior photos are no-nos with common cameras. The journey is smooth and faultless. Recommended for all ages.
,,Different view of Singapore,4.0,,It is good to see Singapore from above. It is much better during the sunset. The cabble car is equipped with fan so it is not very hot. Always better to ride it in the morning or evening if you hate hot feeling.
,,Money trap,1.0,,"This cable car trip is very nice, but was spoiled by the very expensive ticket price. I paid much less for other attraction and got much more. Not recommended."
,,Try it if you want to look at Singapore's habour area,3.0,,A tourist must try... But it will be almost like going on the cable car in Hong Kong. Just that the view in Hong Kong is much more majestic compared to the ones here in Singapore. The Singapore Flyer would be a much better choice!
,,A Great Ride,5.0,,"In the past, whenever we have tried to use the Cable Car, it has been out of order, so we were thrilled to see that it was in action during our Singapore visit and we took full advantage.
We took the cable car from Mt Faber to Sentosa Island and also the seperate Sentosa Island Cable car. The views are tremendous and this ride is well worth the taking."
,,One time worth,3.0,,"Good view from the cable car - definitely worth one time visit. however the ticket is for all the lines, you cant have ticket for one line. so you end up using it for all lines and going to places you would not have visited."
,,Expensive but kids loved it,4.0,,"While it was cheaper to take a cab to Sentosa, we took the cable car back for the experience. My 5&2 year old loved it! They said it was like a roller coaster but not as fast."
,,First experience,5.0,,Nice view during night time. Beautiful view and light. Cooling air. Advice not to go during noon time because is too hot.
,,Very exciting,5.0,,Really it was very exciting tour.During last few years we have visited couple of such type of visit in India but Singapore cable car visit is beyond imagination and amazing.
,,Lovely day at the beach,5.0,,Took a taxi from the hotel to the cable car which took us over to Santosa Island where we had a lovely day relaxing on a beautiful beach. A day away from city life with an exciting zip wire ride down to the beach
,,Great views,5.0,,"We took the cable car from Harbourfront to Sentosa, and it was worth the ticket price. Great views of the harbour area and Sentosa itself."
,,Oh yeah,5.0,,"So freaking cool! I took it to go to the beach on Santosa island. Perfect form start to finish, don't hesitate!"
,,"This is a ""MUST"" to get to Sentosa Island - awesome view",5.0,,"To start this review, I must say that most taxis don't want to take you directly up to the top of Mt Faber Road, preferring to drop you at the bottom - insist this is where you want to go. If you are going to return to Mt Faber by cable car, be aware that a lot of taxi drivers won't take you back down - why? I don't know.
Now the experience itself is fabulous. I'm terrified of heights and hid my face in my husbands shirt a lot of the time but it was so worth it. It's a smooth experience and the view is absolutely spectacular and amazing, especially as you come down to disembark at Sentosa. A definite MUST do experience."
,,Don't be afraid of heights!,5.0,,"We love the Singapore Cable Car. There is such a beautiful expansive view and the only way to get to Sentosa in my opinion. It is a bit of a drive to get to the top of the hill to catch the car at the beginning, but well worth the effort. We take this every time we are in Singapore@"
,,worth a look,3.0,,"The view is great, but the price was not that great. there wasnt really much clarification about what you were buying ticket wise, i asked for a one way ticket but still ended up with a return"
,,So so,3.0,,Overall rate is just 3 over 5. They are quit expensive for foreigner (SGD29 per person as we choose from Mount Faber to Sentosa only). The only way to reach to Mount Faber we need to take a taxi and its very hot inside cable car as the fan is not function at all. But we do enjoy the view and its the alternative way to enter Sentosa.
,,Rip off,4.0,,"This is limiting in that you have to purchase a return ticket which does not stop you from returning by bus, ferry or even walking but having paid for it reduces your likely hood of doing so."
,,Best View,5.0,,"The best view you could get on Santosa, Harbor and the river. Wonderful experience you cannot get anything more. The in island cable car ride is nothing much, but the otter one should not be missed"
,,Scary but must try.,5.0,,"The cable car rides area must I'd you've never soared this high before being left to dangle on a single wire.. Scary but definitely worth a try, only if it means to tick the box which days been there done that. 😉"
,,Worth a try,4.0,,"You take cable car ride to Sentosa, what a view, some cable cars can be a bit shaky, for people afraid of heights, that can be a bit scary, but this ride is very smooth, good way to take a look around Sentosa."
,,Best Cable Car Ride.,5.0,,"One of the Best cable car ride in Asia. Very systematic, fully air conditioned. ITs a breath taking ride of few minutes. You will see lot of ships as you cross over sea. Long queue/waiting over week ends."
,,Great Experience with Spectacular View,5.0,,"A must try if you have not experienced any cable car. You get a good glimpse of the Sentosa Island and the ships. Depending on the package, you can get off at Sentosa and enjoy the attraction."
,,Smooth ride to Sentosa Island,5.0,,"Extremely easy and straight forward to get tickets and hop on to Sentosa. You can either catch this from Mount Faber, or half way town in the Keppel Bay Towers building 2. It is a long enough ride to take some wonderful pictures and short enough to get you there swiftly!"

,,Great Views,4.0,,"Not to be confused with the Sentosa Line Cable Car (separate listing) the line referred to as ""Singapore Cable Car"" or ""Mount Faber Line"" runs from the mainland (Faber Peak or HarbourFront) to Sentosa. It operates from 8.45am - 10pm, last boarding at 9.30pm.

Stations are Mount Faber, HarbourFront and Sentosa. Single Pass is around $26 Adult and $15 Child Senior. This also includes admission fee for Sentosa ($4).

You can also get an all day pass which provides unlimited use of both the Mount Faber and Sentosa lines for a day. This costs around $43 for an an adult. In this way you can view both lines during the day and at night and keep going around until you get the perfect photo you're after. Stopping at a station for lunch or tea before embarking again."
,,"height-phobia temporarily quashed, for the views and the ""island of fun""",5.0,,"As a suffer of 'height-phobia' (or is that 'falling-phobia'?) I was very reluctant to do this activity, and to be honest I don't think very reluctant describes it fully.
Soo, anyway, the rest of my family thought the ride would be a great introduction to Sentosa - the Island of Fun. Which was our destination for the day, after travelling on the MRT we somehow found ourselves at the ticket office, should have been saw this coming... anyway.... we boarded. It is High, no doubts in that, but great photos and views to be had. It is amazing how small a 5 storey cruise ship can seem from this height. Apparently we had unlimited cable car rides so more fun to be had. It is an experience and worth it if ok with towering heights. A good introduction to the island and starting point for discovery. The photos looked good afterwards. We also received attraction passes and enjoyed the segways and light show."
,,just great,5.0,,this was well for the trip and once again they looked after us very well it was worth the trip you get a photo take
,,Great views,4.0,,Something to do if you want an overview of the extent of the wharf area. Sentosa is laid out before you - good photo opportunities
,,Awesome night view!,5.0,,"A ticket entitles you of a complete tip to sentosa, and back to harbourfront centre. Best to enter at night, where the lights are all light up and you can view it from the above. Even if you have no plans to enter sentosa, you can get the feel of being top high with safety and awesome view from where you are. If there isnt many people, and if you lucky, you and your partnet or your own family, or just by yourself, can enter in the 1 cabin. Should there be many people, and you am travelling in smaller group, perhaps you might have to share the cabin with other people. Itdoesnt go fast nor too slow, you can take pictures and when you finally see sentosa view inside from your cabin, take pictures as it looks beautiful. hotels, swimming pools, adventure cove. is all worth to see and visit too.. I had my firt time entering the cable car, safe and private. Personally i would give thumbs up!"
,,Extremely bad customer service,1.0,,"We bought 3 tix for the cable car, starting at merlion station on Sentosa as we were staying at resorts world. My daughters wanted to ride the Mount Faber line, so we had to purchase the Sky Pass tickets to get us onto the Mt Faber line from the merlion station.

Whilst riding the Mr Faber line, the line kept stopping and starting, making my children and wife very scared. We were then told to get off at Harbour front station.

I asked for a refund, and it took 20 mins before I got an answer, and to my surprise, they told me they will only give me a partial refund as I had already ridden on the cable car. WHAT KIND OF RESPONSE IS THAT!?

Very disappointed Singapore Cable Car! You should be ashamed of your customer service!

WARNING everyone, if you experience any issues with the ride, don't expect a good outcome if you ask for a refund!"
,,AWESOME,5.0,,The best way to get a birds eye view of Singapore. Super efficient and well worth it. Best value and once on Santosa Island there is plenty to see and do especially for families with young children.
,,Cable car to santosa island excellent,5.0,,Spent the day on Santosa Island free bus service on Island had something to eat at The Sandbar Café Friendly staff nice food .
,,Nice view!,4.0,,"It is not cheap but I would say it is worth doing once so you can have an aerial view of the city. At Faber Point, it appears that you can walk to a few attractions such as Faber Point, World War II Bunker and Henderson Waves but unfortunately we did not have time to explore.

Tip: In the Tiger Air magazine, it mentions that if you bring your boarding pass, you can get 10% discount. We had forgotten ours so we did not try it and I am not sure if it works with any airlines or if this was a limited time promotion."
,,High in the Skies,5.0,,"Second visit to this experience and in the new, modernised cable cars. From Mount Faber where my family live over to Sentosa and return and taking in an aerial view of the world below; very well organised."
,,Pleasant trip,4.0,,"Easy to get to and a reasonable price. Trip to Santosa Island did not take too long and although not the best weather day, the cable car was comfortable and stable."
,,Its very High,4.0,,I took the cable car to sentosa by morning and the views are really nice and the cable car is going quite high. Its not cheap and you dont have to ride the cable car to get to Sentosa its an experience if you wish to try it out.
,,Getting to Santosa ad back,4.0,,Even f you have no plans to explore Santosa catching the Cable car can be a fun activity to do to take in the sights. A ticket on the cable car provides for a full return trip from the point you get on. So if you hop on in the city you can do a full circuit out to Santosa back up to Mt Faber and then back to the city. Hoping off at any point to take in the sights and explore your surroundings.
,,Take the Cable car to Sentosa,4.0,,"Take the Cable car to Sentosa, it is great fun and the view is really good. It is not cheap however it is worth it.
When you are there you have plenty of things to do including doing a free fall in a wind machine, Take a Luge down the hill to the beach and have a good look around or go to Universal Park for the rides and when you are done take the chair lift back up the hill.

There are plenty of places to eat including McDonalds, or take a picnic and eat it on the beach.
The beach really nice and they had life guards on watch. The sea is not clear and no good for snorkelling."
,,"""Its fun, covers three locations in Singapore""",5.0,,"We took the cable car ride from Harbour front and then it gooes to sentos island and another place which i forgot. Its a nice experience, we went at night so you can see Singapore lit beautifully with so much lights! Not scary at all"
,,Morning,5.0,,Just be careful no down time for smelly people. View is great. After the ride that's where you have a problem. All the sites after this (except for the beach side fireworks) are full of smelly people. Beware hard to breath especially if during summer. Waiting areas do not have a/c.
,,"Nice views of the city and Sentosa, quick and effective",4.0,,"There are two lines, one which connects from the main island to Sentosa, and one which goes within Sentosa. I bought a ticket for both and saw the whole experience. Each stop is about 5-9 minutes apart and the views you get in a clear box are wonderful. Its a great way to see the city if you havnt done the flyer, where you get more or less the same but from a static location.

The cart which connects the island to Sentosa allows you to see the various hotels and theme parks on the island that you may wish to try out.

The only drawback is that I found at £15 it wasnt exactly the cheapest cable car iv been on. Certainly if you are only looking to get to Sentosa, id recommend walking from the Volvocity shopping centre, which is about a 6 minute walk and free. Compared to here, which is a much longer walk from the MRT just to get to the cable cart terminal (about 15 minutes). So if you like cable cars, try it but if you like walking, give it a miss."
,,A Wonderful Ride,5.0,,"We took a round trip tour from harbor front to Sentosa (Imbiah lookout) and then another one inside the Sentosa island. It was a wonderful tour and got the experience of many wonderful views. If you go to Singapore, worth to list this in your to-do list."
,,one of the best cable car in asia,5.0,,experience was good its has nice view. This was another brilliant day spent going over to Santosa Island via cable car. Its an expensive way to travel over to Sentosa but its fun to do once if you have children.
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"Done this twice now, once in daytime and again at night. Nice way to travel over to Sentosa. During the day you can see everything and at night the place is beautifully lit up. Would definitely reccomend."
,,for the first visit...must,5.0,,a must visit...put it in your bucket list if visiting singapore for the first time…..dont miss this….
,,Cable car,5.0,,"Great views , not for anyone who is scared of heights but worth a visit, staff really friendly, if you go to Singapore this is worth a visit"
,,5 Day Visit,5.0,,This was another brilliant day spent going over to Santosa Island via cable car. Another must. The island was good and the beaches were great.
,,Expensive for a 10 minute ride,3.0,,Its an expensive way to travel over to Sentosa but its fun to do once if you have children. I wouldnt mind the fee so much if the staff could manage to offer a smile whilst barking commands at the custmers
,,Nice view,5.0,,33s$ per passenger. excellent to have a high view of Sentosa island. If you want access to Sentosa activities (Universal-SEA Aquarium- etc ...) better to take the monorail from VIVO mall at Harbor Front Station MRT
,,Lovely experience,5.0,,"This was fantastic, even for someone who does not like heights. The view is amazing and we felt safe and secure."
,,Approach Sentosa in Style,5.0,,"The cable car from Mount Faber takes you to Sentosa Island which is the recreation destination for all tourists in Singapore. The cable cars are based on the Justice League theme (at least they were when I went there) and there's an app which you can download which makes Justice League characters go live inside your cabin..! (In your mobile phone's camera). Well maintained cable cards and smooth queues, not much waiting time. Do try it once!"
,,Scenic Cable car ride,5.0,,The views from cable car are just so beautiful. It gives you view of Singapore in a different way. Must try at Sentosa.
,,Morning sightseeing...,4.0,,"Yes it is expensive by Australian standards, but a great way to see Singapore by air. Very modern and clean, with great views to be had. We did both lines (recommended) as a round trip."
,,Lovely view,5.0,,This Cable car connects to Sentosa and a nice way to get there. It was a very scenic view above the water. Enjoyable ride.
,,Must do thing if you visit Singapore,5.0,,The cable car ride will give you a very nice view of the Singapore city and a very unique experience. People of all ages will enjoy this.
,,Nice views while a brand new experince,4.0,,We had the CC ride from Promanade to Santosa. It was the first time for us and a great experience. The heights were really enthusiastic and ride was thrilling though the car speed was very low. The night view back from Santosa was also a thing to experience.
,,Mount Faber,4.0,,Another 'Must do' while in Singapore. The cable car ride from Mount Faber to Sentosa Island is quite spectacular and well worth the experience.
,,great views from Mt Faber,5.0,,This is a must do while visiting Singapore. The whole experience is amazing with great views of Singapore.
,,Enjoyed by all,5.0,,"My family of 4 enjoyed our cable car experience. We enjoyed a day ride to sentosa and a night ride back. The view was just beautiful both ways. Definetely an experience worth doing. The toilets on the singapore side were amazing too!!
We purchased tickets through a local travel agent making the tickets cheaper than the direct price."
,,"Excellent, enjoyable and very amazing views",5.0,,"Excellent, enjoyable and very amazing views Can have a good time. Take in towards journey to the Sentosa Island."
,,Beautiful View,5.0,,This is an amazing way to travel to Santosa Island. You can see the whole Island and the Habour while traveling to Santosa
,,Great,4.0,,Great way to view some good sights of Sentosa Island and the Ferry port area. Buy a general travel ticket for all stops.
,,Great fun,5.0,,"It a very efficiently run cable car system. I was dreading the queues. But there wasn't any! I had worked out the the best place to board is Harbour Front which is mid way between Sentosa and Mount Faber station. I took the MRT from Orchard to Harbour Front. Mount Faber is up in the hills so it would difficult to start off from there.
At the ticket kiosk which is in an office block, its a simple matter of paying to go on some of the network or all of it. I think it was $29 pp. to go everywhere on the network. Well worth the experience."
,,Fun way to get to Sentosa !,4.0,,Travelled early morning to Sentosa and then transferred to the island cable car to visit the beaches and the enormous Merlion. Fantastic views of the city and the port with dozens of ships anchored off shore. Very helpful and friendly staff. Good value for money if you buy a combined ticket.
,,A must see in Singapore,5.0,,We took the cable car to Sentosa Island. We booked the ticket for the cable car along with the rides for Sentosa. The view is wonderful. My little girl enjoyed the ride so much that we ended up returning two more times during our trip to Singapore.
,,Good views,5.0,,We did this twice on two occasions once on the universal trip then again on afternoon till sunset trip
,,Awesome Views of Singapore & Sentosa,5.0,,"The Singapore Cable Car is a fun way to travel between Singapore & Sentosa. From high above everything you have a 360 view of the expansive city as well as the port full of ships and the Sentosa island attractions too. ""Flying"" over Universal Studios and the cruise ships in port was an interesting perspective. When we reached Mt Faber we passed on through the gift shop and took a short walk to a cafe nearby for cold drinks and snacks and a nice view of Singapore below. When we returned to Sentosa, we hopped aboard another cable car line that flies above the island from one end to the other. One ticket to do it all - not too bad at 29SGD per person."
,,Good ride to see the Sentosa,4.0,,We took the ride from the city across the river to the Sentosa and turned around. It was good. But the fee was a bit expensive.
,,Nice alternative how to get to Sentoza,4.0,,Perfect views of SouthernSingapore as well as Sentoza Island - Merlion is waiting ;-) Also not to fotget the cable car museum - very interesting. The entry fee to Sentoza is already included in the ticket as well.
,,not worth the $$,3.0,,$$ spent not worth the distance of the trip.. the view was similar to singapore flyer and marina skypark. Might as well go to sentosa peak and see...
,,Superb Experience!,5.0,,This is Superb experience bit expensive but worth all the money! Two different routes but both are great! it was very beautiful during rainy. Just go for it if possible!
,,Nice Experiance,5.0,,Nice experience to go reach Sentosa though little expensive. Take this as part of Sentosa package. Then its is worth.
,,Different Experience,5.0,,"We took the cable car on our way to Sentosa Island. It provides a different perspective of the place and if you have done it before, its worth the time."
,,Fun ride...great view..,3.0,,"This was a fun ride, but bit short (10 min per way).Excellent way to see views of Sentosa Island. We went early in the morning. It was not crowded."
,,Fun time,5.0,,This is a great fun way to get to Sentosa island to see all the attractions there rather than take the usual car trip
,,Great Ride,5.0,,We boarded the Cable Card at Harbourside and travelled up to Mt Faber peak where we got off and had a look around at the gardens and views. We then hopped back on for the remainder of our journey down to Sentosa Island. Magnificent views of harbour and city.
,,Expensive but a must do!,4.0,,After visiting Sentosa we caught the cable car to Mt. Faber so that we could experience the ride across the bay and part of the city. It is a reasonably quick ride and we found that there was not much to do on Mt. Faber but our tickets allowed us to return to the cable car station near the harbour which we did and then caught a taxi back to our Hotel.
,,the thrill rides...,5.0,,a must try when in singapore. both mount faber line and the sentosa line are thrill n fun. the ticket includes a round trip. take the combo ticket of both the lines. the most thrilling n chilling point is when u r at the high tower between Tower 2 and Sentosa. its really very very high. u can feel the height in ur guts. :) best is to start from Harbour Front Tower 2. go to sentosa. spend the day at sentosa. enjoy the sentosa line cable car which takes u to the siloso beach n back. late afternoon take the cable car direct to faber peak. enjoy the evening there. when at faber peak walk down the mount to see the henderson waves. climb back n return to Harbour Front Tower 2 by cable car. starting and ending at Harbour Front Tower 2 is good for transport connections (MRT/Buses). nearest MRT station - Harbour Front.
,,Awesome journey and amazing view,5.0,,It was a nice experience to Santosa Island but little bit expensive.... View was nice from the top... Me and my sister get this cable ride from the city to the island.... It was a great view of the island and little bit the city from the cable car....We took the unlimited ride ticket and it was good decision for us....
,,Good but not great...,4.0,,"Quite frankly I didn't know what to expect from this cable car ride and we did it as we just wanted to see and experience it. The two stations of the cable car have the usual offerings souvenir shops and some cafes, nothing fancy. The ride as such gives some nice views over Singapore. So if you just want to enjoy a nice view it is worth jumping on the cable car, otherwise nothing exciting."
,,amazing vies,5.0,,This is a fun ride and you get off at various stops and rejoin it if you wish. There are great vies. We went early in the morning when it wasn't so busy and had the cable car to ourselves but at busy times you have to share
,,Singapore Cable Car,5.0,,We took the Singapore Cable Car to get to Sentosa Island. It was a nice way to see Singapore from above! The view was great and it felt safe. We bought the ticket that also allowed us to use the Sentosa Cable car! It was worth trying!
,,"Offers good views, but expensive and no discount for Tourist Seniors",3.0,,"Some nice views over Singapore which negate the use of other Non Free High 'Rides' here while it is expensive for the amount of time you are on it.

Unlike a number of other countries you have to be a Singaporean Senior 'Resident' to qualify for the Seniors Discount, while a number of other countries offer a Discounted Ticket for a Non Resident Senior (Tourist) on all their attractions."
,,Fun Overview!,5.0,,There is so little to see in Singapore that you might as well see all of it from the air and get on with your life!
,,Great view of Singapore,4.0,,"Even by Singapore standards, the cable car is fairly expensive way to enter Sentosa Island. But the cable car provide great view of Singapore harbor and Sentosa, so taking Cable car at least one way will be touristy thing to do. We saw a Cruise ship in the harbor from over the top, that was cool. The ride is comfortable and from that height, you feel a thrill when the car crosses the water below."
,,Good view and fun!,5.0,,Took the cable car to Sentosa Island. Enjoyed the free return tickets (two-way ride) from the SIA Stopover deal! From the cable car you can have the 360-degree view of beautiful Singapore Harbour. The cable car is clean and the ride is smooth.
,,Nice ride with good views but pretty expensive,4.0,,"The cable cars are a convenient way of getting onto Sentosa from Harbourfront and they are also pretty good for getting around the western half of Sentosa, where all the attractions are. The views from the cars are pretty awesome, however, the prices for those combined rides is more than SGD 25, which I find quite steep based on that the rides are all pretty short, especially the rides on Sentosa itself. And you can only do each section (return) once! Next time I would probably take the new Sentosa Express, a monorail that connects Harbourfront with Sentosa and goes down to the beach also. It's much cheaper at only SGD 4 but apart from the price, the cable car was a good experience. So, despite the price, still recommendable."
,,good to try,5.0,,we tried this cable car ride from the city to the Sentosa resort. It was nice try and enjoyed great view of the island. But the cost is a bit expensive.
,,Thrilling!,5.0,,"This cable car takes your from over the Sentosa land. There is one point when you are on top of just the Sea. I loved that part so much! The cable car is big enough to fit a family of 5-6. But even if it's just 2 of you, they give you complete privacy! There were some cars with tables (food and drinks served) as well, although I am unsure how to get those. They dont have AC inside but at such a height you will not miss AC but rather enjoy the natural wind. The speed depends upon the weather and traffic.

You can take the cable car and get down at different stations in between to enjoy them and come back! It depends upon you how long you stay at each station.

Worth!"
,,Good views,4.0,,Great ride from Mt Faber to Santosa. Views of waterfront were good. A bit pricey but packages available if you plan on taking in attractions on Santosa mean you save a few bucks.
,,Aerial,4.0,,This a very good aerial view of Singapore.The santosa island is a popular place to go for in Singapore.The cable car ride is good for kids they enjoy.
,,I suggest taking the cable car when you visit Sentosa.,4.0,,I suggest taking the cable car when you visit Sentosa. It is not that expensive. Buy the Round trip ticket. The view was excellent.
,,Great way to travel,5.0,,"This is my second time doing the cable car. It was great fun seeing the beautiful views of Singapore.

My friend had a year pass for the cable car which costs $39. As my friend had a pass I also received a 5% discount on my ticket."
,,Third time,5.0,,"This the best way to get to Sentosa Island.Now expanded on the Island,it gives a brilliant view of the whole place.When you return,carry on up to Mount Faber,and the view over waterfront etc. are outstanding."
,,A good bird's eye view of Santosa Island,5.0,,"Singapore Cable Car provides a good bird's eye view of Santosa Island, a popular tourist destination. Kids really loved the ride."
,,Watch Singapore from here,5.0,,"We went in it from mount Faber peak, quite a wonderful view of sea and Singapore, really worthwhile every penny spent"
,,An enjoyable experience,4.0,,We travelled on the cable car as part of an organised trip. I was apprehensive as heights is something l am not good at but this was no particular problem. As with most things in Singapore it is well organis d efficient and clean. The cable car is no exception and it adds another means of transport experienc d on our visit. The views are good and l would recommend even for those like me who are a little frightened of heights.
,,Scenery and sights around Sentosa,5.0,,"We really enjoyed this journey. Taken at the end of a hot day it was the perfect way to catch some of the sights a they transitioned from day to evening. Harbour views became magical as the lights of the area all came to life like fairies twinkling into existence. We got some great photos of the harbour and Sentosa Island area, in differing aspects as the forward journey to the island was in daylight and the return journey took us back after dark. We were able to alight on Sentosa Island and enjoy some of the local attractions before completing the round trip and this was a really enjoyable way to enjoy the area and avoid the clutter and bustle of the taxi ranks."
,,A good experience,4.0,,As im not good with heights once again a bit scared but we took this to Santosa Island and I really enjoyed the experience.
,,good one but expensive,4.0,,a nice cable car. offers cool view from here. but very expensive. u can try once u go to santosa island.
,,Whizzing across to Sentosa,4.0,,"Grabbed a cab from my hotel to the cable car. There are no single tickets. You are expected to come back that way, but I had other plans.
All-in-all, it wasn't a bad ride. If you're there with the family, why not try and incorporate it with some of the various activities that they have available? Definitely, looks worthwhile. I was off to see the Merlion!"
,,Must do in Singapore,5.0,,"You have to do this if you visit the city, wonderful views and not too expensive, there are various special trips with food and so on if you have a deep wallet, a restaurant at the top as well which I wouldn't expect to be cheap. Best to have a trip on here when you are visiting Sentosa."
,,Memorable moments,5.0,,"We were confused whether to pay for it or not. You can visit Sentosa directly by car ride but if you do so, you will miss a lifetime experience. Amazing sea view. We also got a glimpse of star cruise. You can walk, run in it without any fear. Amazing indoor decoration makes it photographic. Don't miss it."
,,A nice way to get to Sentosa,4.0,,"The Cable Car ride is the best way to see Sentosa, fantastic views, definitely worth getting the full ticket to use the cross island line as well."
,,Enjoyable cable car experience,4.0,,A most enjoyable cable car experience over and around Santosa Island and Faber Peak. Beautiful scenery from a well maintained and supervised cable car
,,I like this ride more than Singapore Flyer,5.0,,"We took the rides return afternoon and night time after the 'Wing of the Time' show. Both day and night views are gorgeous. There is no building block and you can easy to get your private cabin. The queues are not too long. It's quite pricey but if you like the view and scenery, it's worth to do it. Highly recommend."
,,A fun way to Sentosa,4.0,,"It may be cheaper and quicker to take the monorail or bus to Sentosa, but spare the time and get a round trip cable car ticket to Faber Peak and Sentosa and experience the vistas in relaxed comfort. We travelled mid-week and there was no queuing. Boarding is a few minutes walk from the Harbourfront MRT station and is well signposted."
,,Must do in Singapore,5.0,,"A singapore tour is not complete without taking a cable car to Sentosa. A safe and thrilling experience.

A two way trip to Sentosa from Harbour front costs S$26. This will take you from Harbor front station to sentosa station. There is now a new cable car network which is inside the Sentosa island which is connecting different spots in the island itself. A ticket for both the cable cars costs S$29. It is worth taking both."
,,Overpriced for ride that is too short.,1.0,,"Ride is too short for the ridiculous overprice. Especially if you are bringing other people along. Don't bother.

Save that money for other things. There are other ways to get to sentosa and there are other free views you can get.

Nearby to Mount Faber, 10 minutes walk there is Henderson wave. Can have a nice stroll there rather than wasting."
,,scenic ride,5.0,,"Excellent cable car ride from Vivo city to Sentosa (also allows you to get off at Mt.Faber), very safe & efficient ride, allows for great viewing over the city & Sentosa resorts world. Would highly recommend taking the cable car during your trip for the experience."
,,Way to go to sentosa,4.0,,Travelled to Sentosa in the cable car. Views are nice from the top. Its safe and fast. Overall good experience.
,,Nothing great,3.0,,General view of singapore can be observed from the cable car. visited sentosha through one way. kids may enjoy
,,"What a view, from Mt Faber to Sentosa and return.",4.0,,Must do every trip to Singapore. Amazing ride with no worries about safety. Food at Mt Faber is great.
,,Even if your terrified of heights .. It's well worth the nail biting experience.,5.0,,"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome. Would hate to do it on a windy day, but the views were amazing, best way to get to Sentosa Island."
,,Great views of the harbour,5.0,,"Got the cable car over to sentosa island from harbour bay mrt station, fantastic views of the harbour & beyond, it goes over the top of any cruise liners in the harbour, well worth the trip"
,,The only way to go!,5.0,,"Travelled to Sentosa by cable car and it was great. Safe, efficient and fast. The wife is not so daring but even she said it was great!"
,,Fantastic view,5.0,,We caught a train from City Hall to Harbour Front then caught the cable car to Sentosa. Cost was $29 each return. Great views.
,,Cable car to sentosa,4.0,,"A very nice experience,as we took the whole cable car ride from Mt Faber which is the starting point to sentosa island and also the new cable car ride in sentosa that takes you to silosa,on one side and the merlionpark on the other side,,you can hop off and on as long as you the whole ride in one direction,,a little bit expensive compared to the sentosa express one can catch from hourbour front stop,,,but great views and the fastest way to get around the island,,"
,,Nice to see Singapore here,5.0,,Both the cable cars are worth doing it. It was hot inside as no air condition but it would be better if done after 5.00pm. Still you enjoy seeing the harbour and sentosa plus singapore from height.
,,You must do it once,4.0,,It was a nice day and plenty to see although the cars are not air condoned and it was so hot. Don't bother taking the trip to Faber Peak as there really is nothing to see
,,I scared of heights but the views are well worth it,5.0,,"Singapore Cable Car is a great way to see the city - starting on the 16th floor of a tower block you are launched off the side towards Sentosa Island - I took the option to have the ride around the island also getting off at each point for a look around, and an ice cream. Before heading over the river then over the highway to the mountain on the other side. When you get off at the mountain take some time to explore and walk up the hill to the viewing points they are well worth a look.

Despite been scared of heights I had a great time and the views are fabulous"
,,Great way to see Singapore!,5.0,,A great way to get a different view of Singapore! Great for the kids. Maybe go later in the day when the sun isn't so hot.
,,Nice way to travel,3.0,,"Give you a good view on your way to Santosa Island. Worth it for a experience but if you are on a budget will take to monorail instead.
while it was a good experience, have had better in Hongkong on the Ngong Ping 360 cable car"
,,Nice time to spend with family,4.0,,We have traveled from Harbour to Sentosa island. lovely outside views. gift shops at destinations are also very nice. I would love to travel to this place again in future.
,,Spectacular views,5.0,,Wow! What an awesome experience and we managed to get a coupon deal. We combined it with a trip to Sentosa so got to go on a number of different cable cars. The view over looking back to the city was stunning even though it was raining. Modern cable cars-clean and safe
,,A pretty flexible way to explore the island's southern skyline,4.0,,"One ticket buys you a journey across two cable cable car lines. One of them is the more spectacular older one and another newer one on the Sentosa island.
Try to make it during sunset time on a weekday and if you're lucky you may have the gondola to yourself.
The two lines have a total of 6 stops and you may get off or on anywhere once. Gives you a flexibility to explore Mount Faber, Vivo City Mall and Sentosa Island all-in-one."
,,Excellent views of the city and beyond,4.0,,"Took the cable car up to Mount Faber both car and station had superb views. There is a gift shop, toilet and restaurant at the top. Then returned to Sentosa island and back to the mainland.Took loads of photographs and loved the experience."
,,nice for taking pics from a different angle,4.0,,"If you have never taken a cable car ride before, this would be a nice novel experience. Else, it's just another way to transport yourself from point A to B.

Should you decide to try...
...start from Harbourfront and then go to Mount Faber, alight there and give yourself time (maybe 30-45 mins.) to explore the amenities (restaurants, toilet with a great view) and nearby attractions - Merlion and views of Sentosa.
...from Mount Faber, head towards Sentosa which I presume is your ultimate goal for the day.
...the package usually includes a leg Sentosa to Harbourfront which you can forgo if you want to try other ways to get out of Sentosa

The cost of the ride is quite steep but I think it's cost of safety, after all, you would want the cables to be maintained regularly."
,,Great Trip From the Mainland to Sentosa Island,5.0,,"If you are in central Singapore you will need to take the MTR to the cable car station.
The view as cable car crosses from the mainland to Sentosa Island is far reaching. The sad thing is that it doesn't last long enough but that really can't be helped. There are tourist shops at the cable car stations and toilets so it is very user friendly.
From the cable car you will see freight ships and cruise ships plus the far reaching countryside - really really good views."
,,Fabulous Mount Faber,5.0,,"We allowed time to spend time at the Mount Faber Bar and Bistro which has fantastic views, staff and drinks before taking the cable to Sentosa. A great Singapore attraction."
,,Dose of High Energy,5.0,,"Reach Mount Faber and travel from there to Harbour front cable car station. You will travel over the lusgh green Mount Faber slopes followed by busy Keppel Road. The next leg of cable takes you to Sentosa. As you fly , observe Singapore Cruise Centre below you. If you are lucky you will see some great cruise ships berthed. Later get bird's eye view of Resorts World ,Sentosa and ships plying in the ocean. Inside Sentosa you have cable car connecting you to Siloso beach and Merlion point. The round trip ticket costs just 29 Sing Dolls and if you pay 1 Dollar more you can make a second pleasure trip on entire network of cable cars. It's value for money."
,,Wow! great Views!,5.0,,We took the cable car not only to Faber Mountain but also to Sentosa. There is a package deal offered. The views were fantastic. The cars were clean and everything moved rapidly-no long lines. Doing both Faber and Sentosa takes a few hours-more if you get off and walk around like we did.
,,Just like any other Cable car ....,3.0,,"This is just like any other cable car you see .
The only advantage is that it is a really quick way to go to Sentosa from Mount Faber . But this is also costly .
If travelled in Cable car before , use MRT to go to sentosa"
,,Exciting,4.0,,"We took the cable car to visit Sentosa and found it to be an exciting way of getting there. it felt totally safe,the views were awesome on the way over.There are gift shops on each end of the destinations and the staff were polite."
,,Very cool,5.0,,We took the cable car over to the beaches and it was really cool to look over different parts of the country. The car doesn't move too quickly so it doesn't move very much on the way over. It is easy to access through the mall.
,,Cable car...,3.0,,We visited sentosa on 3rd March.. We took cable car from vivo city mall station to sentosa.. I didnot find it too good for 29sgd per pax.. Instead I will recommend sky & luge... It was awesome ride of sentosa imbiah station.if you want to live the beauty of sentosa.. Skyride is must.. Even Singapore flyer is also a best option to view the city... Cable car is over rated.. In my opinion... Thanks..
,,Amazing ride,4.0,,Wow what a amazing ride! really scary also! It is quite high but i think it safe:) You should visit the beautiful beach also in sentosa island
,,Interesting viewpoint,4.0,,"If you have a little spare time, definitely do this, but don't worry to much if you cannot. I would recommend getting a taxi to Mt Fabre to see the lookout and also the Bell of Happines and there is a railing full of bells signed by people. You can buy and hang a bell of your own."
,,Really great experience,5.0,,"This is a must do experience in Singapore. It is a beautiful view of the city from high above. We went right over our cruise ship, kept snapping pictures!"
,,Wobbly in the wind,4.0,,Spectacular views over this particular part of Singapore. However tickets quite expensive. Better to buy this trip as a part of some king of tourist package.
,,A Beautiful Experience,5.0,,A beautiful experience and you can see the entire Sentosa Island from the top. It is a smooth ride on the cable car and from the height one can see the real sentosa. A must do activity
,,Love the view,5.0,,"we go on this every time we go to Singapore, It gives you the most amazing view of Sentosa, and takes you to the top of Mount Faber, which is also a great place to visit"
,,One way to get to Sentosa,4.0,,"We used the cable car to go to Sentosa after walking the ridge.
Bit pricey for a one way trip as no one way ticket option. Also no recognition of overseas seniors cards.
A good distance, not quite some of our Swiss rides, but the views are most spectacular."
,,Vantage point of Singapore,4.0,,"Once you are starting to move on the cable car over the city, you get the best views of the city. Get a peek in every aspect of the city almost.A must ride."
,,Best views,5.0,,Best views of the city and harbour areas. Make sure you take the all day pass and the Sentosa pass and do a few trips on it. It's worth every cent
,,Over priced and just a bit ....meh,3.0,,"We took the cable car over to Sentosa for dinner and back again when some visitors were in town. We were looking forward to the views, however we were very shocked at the price. We did not think it was worth it."
,,Nice but too fast,5.0,,"it was a nice ride, but it was too fast, didn't have enough time to enjoy. for the money I paid it was too short, and I won't do it again."
,,Love the view,5.0,,"Wow what a ride, loved the view, bit of heart in mouth going through a building but loved it, did it twice, was awesome to do as the lights if Singapore come on."
,,Beautiful way of travel,5.0,,"Had a triple package with Universal, SEA Aquarium entries and unlimited cable car and Sentosa cable car rides. Look for it on the website because you can save a little with it.

The ride itself is 10 mins from Faber Peak and about 4-5 from the Waterfront. I suggest going from the Faber peak because it goes above the rainforest and looks amazing! It is also a really nice way to arrive to Sentosa!"
,,Best way to get to Sentosa,5.0,,"Fantastic views of the new resort, you must have a head for heights though. Not expensive, reasonably priced Tiger Balm in their gift shoppe"
,,Worth the ride.,4.0,,You get a great view of the city from the cable car. Its a great way to cross over to Sentosa Island from the city. The cars are mostly glass so the view is available all around. There is a souvenier shop at the top. Worth a trip.
,,Nothing much can be seen,3.0,,"It is OK if you finished all what you want to do in Singapore and still have time to spent on the island but do not want to do anything with activity, not so great."
,,View from Above,5.0,,The 360 degree views is addictive. Fell in love with nature and make sure to take some pictures.. -have a good trip <3
,,heaven like feeling!!,5.0,,if you want to experience pure heavenly ride then its the perfect ride.the view from cable car is awestruck!!its totally unbelievable!!!i will refer if visiting Singapore then everyone should definitely take a cable car ride!!

,,Nice View of Harbor,5.0,,"We take cable car from vivi city to Sentosa Island. It's a very nice view looking to the harbor, sentosa island and passing the Virgo Cruise with has very nice view from the top.

Very interesting for kids actually, for people who have high fobia is not recommended."
,,"For me it was average, for my kids its five stars!!!",4.0,,"I'm not a fan of cable car. But my wife and kids love it. I have to admit that looking at Singapore from cable cars is a fantastic view. But the time spent for getting a ticket and the time for the trip is not ""Excellent"" for me. If you don't have time and money limitations, then this is something you should do in Singapore.."
,,Great Views,5.0,,Travelled over to Sentosa on cable car. The views are great and a good experience for those on a short stop over
,,Good views,4.0,,We used cabel car from mount Faber to Sentosa.. Very nice views.. It was morning and we could see the harbour and far away!! Locals recommended the other side as well. Trying Sentosa to Faber at night to get SG view from Faber at night.. You could try that also..

Really great value and a must do if in Singapore."
,,Good fun...,4.0,,The cable car experience is a nice way to arrive at Sentosa - used to be a lot more fun before. Great view. You can get here from HarbourFront. Good experience for first timers.
,,Are you afraid of height?,5.0,,"Right from Mount Faber station, we were talking and taking in the sights, but suddenly we were not talking anymore... because it is really too high up, you realise you are controlling your breathing and when you swallow your saliva, you do it gently because you just dont want to rock the car... suggest evening ride at half six, it is when the sun is going down and lights from the harbour start to mesmerise... have fun..."
,,Brilliant views !,4.0,,Brilliant scenic way to get across to Sentosa - bit scary in the wind but really good fun ! Can see for miles on a clear day - definitely worth the experience!
,,Very Good Experience,4.0,,Used our Singapore Explorer Pass for a free return ride to Sentosa Island. Boarded the cable car at the Harbourfront Centre. Only the 3 of us in the car as it was a weekday. Weather was very good and we had excellent views of Singapore and over the variety of attractions on Sentosa Island. Also used the cable car line on the island as it was included in our ticket. Our son was also able to take a free Segway ride on the island that was available with the Explorer Pass. Would expect that on weekends that there would be a lot more families visiting the attractions.
,,Amazing,4.0,,"Real amazing experience, great landscapes and views of the surroundings. It worth the ticket and don't forfettario the camera!!! Suggested."
,,Fabulous views,5.0,,"We caught the mrt to harbour front and then bought tickets for faber peak and sentosa, $29 each. We first went up to Faber Peak and there are fabulous views over and beyond Sentosa island. We walked along the Faber loop and over the unusual Henderson Waves bridge. There are signs warning about wild monkeys but we didn't see any. We saw an oriole, brilliant yellow, and a very pretty spotted butterfly.
Then we went on the cable car to Sentosa. The cars take 8 people but we had one to ourselves for each trip. Very interesting to look down on the cruise ships as you go over. We went from one end of the sentosa line to the other, stopping off to see the merlion. The beaches look wonderful and everywhere is very clean and well maintained. Finally we caught the cable car back to our starting point. A very enjoyable half day out."
,,"A bit expensive for a short ride, but worthwhile",4.0,,"When we have guests from abroad, we usually take them on the Singapore Cable Car.

It's not cheap, for such a short ride, but the views are good.

You can make a day trip out of it, if you e.g. start at Sentosa Island, take the cable car from there to Mount Faber and go walking the Southern Ridges from there, all the way to Hortpark.

I wrote several articles about this on my blog curlytraveller.com"
,,Good views,4.0,,I went to Sentosa Island and this one way ride in the Cable Car was included in the half day tour. It was a good way to get to Sentosa and provided good views and a smooth journey although it is rather short.
,,A fun way of getting to the destination,5.0,,"Cable-cars by their nature give great views. In addition, they’re an easy way to reach the destination.
Views from the cars are excellent, and I’m pleased to say they no longer block any of the windows with pictures - it used to happen. Cars can get rather warm. The opening windows help, but on the Faber to Sentosa route, they’re only on one side of the car, and don’t get much airflow if on the downwind side. However fan have now been fitted, so we always find the temperature pleasant.
You can buy tickets to cover both the route from Sentosa to Mt Faber, and also the route on the island from Imbiah to Siloso. Although the latter is quite short, it does give some stunning views of the forest on Sentosa as well as parts of Singapore. The small extra cost of buying the ticket for both routes is well justified. I do prefer the unlimited use tickets, it’s worth the extra as it’s great to also do the ride after dark.
Local residents will find the Faber Licence outstanding value at S$39 as it gives unlimited access to the cable-cars for a year, sadly it’s not available to visitors.
Most of the time boarding is quick, with very short queues, if any. Peak times can be difficult. Tour groups on occasions will use a sequence of cars, so you have to wait until they’ve all gone through. But overall, on weekdays we’ve had little delay using the cars.
Disabled access is good, with lifts when necessary. Toilets are easily found at all Sentosa stations, naturally they are always very clean. Mt Faber can be a problem, the toilets are at the foot of the steps down from the gift shop, turn right at the bottom. The signs aren’t obvious, so ask staff for help if necessary.
Our first visit to Sentosa was by cable-car (in those days it was cable-car or ferry, the causeway did not exist). We’ve enjoyed every ride. It is expensive, but unforgettable."
,,Excellent,5.0,,what a view on both lines. we took tickets of both the cable car and enjoyed the view. Best part when it enters into building and come out from there. No claustrophobia for wife. since children were in universal studio doing all dangerous ride we decided to do cable car since our age was not permitting to do rides. Its beautiful experience. Dr jain
,,Worth it!!,4.0,,The cable car ride is superb.. the view is mind blowing.. you can take this cable car in order to reach Sentosa Island..
,,Great experience!,5.0,,"This ride is a great way to see the Sentosa Island and to It's safe and staff are really nice too. Though a bit expensive especially round trip rides, it's worth the money...don't forget to check on promos and bundles on this ride with your travel agent or living social."
,,Worth the ride,5.0,,"The Cable car is one of the ways to get to Sentosa Island. You can also take the train or by car through an underground bridge. The cable car is far more worth it. It's a long ride to the island, so it's worth the money, and not to mention the view!! If it's your first visit to Sentosa Island, definitely go by cable car. It might be a once in a lifetime chance to do it, so you might as well."
,,Very elegant,4.0,,"Despite being Chinese new year it was not crowded. Very efficient and polite staff. Cable cars were clean and gave great views, not claustrophobic at all. My ticket provided a ride on both lines, great to see the whole Island. Would recommend."
,,Enjoyed the cable car on way to Sartosa,5.0,,Excellent ride to remember for a long time. Will visit again for future and had good time. had a good time.
,,You have to once,5.0,,We took the cable car over to sentosa the first time we went across and it was awesome. I definitely recommend everyone to do this at least once. Its worth every dollar! The views you get are amazing and allows you to see where everything is on the island. Its great to sit back and relax and enjoy the trip over. Maybe not for those with a big fear of heights as it goes very high. You can buy a pass that allows you to ride both lines (mount faber and sentosa) that way you will experience the whole island too.
,,Bretah taking,5.0,,"We caught a taxi from the hotel to the cable car a ride of 20 minutes and costing 7 dollars very cheap. The cable car ride was great & very enjoyable, on arrival finding that there was another cable car ride going across the island & was included in the ticket. Great ride as well & you see the place from the comfort of the car above the tree tops."
,,Take cable car during the day and at night for the best experience,5.0,,"The view from the cable car is beautiful. During the day time, the clear waters and the view from the cable car is amazing. At night, the lights from the city light up the surroundings. Great for thrill seekers and those not afraid of heights."
,,January Family holiday 2016,5.0,,Has been 37 years between trips...to say the cables cars are much better now is an understatement. Very smooyj crossing and great views.
,,Must for first timers,5.0,,"I've been in one of these before, not sure if many times but I remember in Malaysia. It was way higher and longer. Back then, this cable car is not yet fixed so we didn't get to ride it.
The cable car we rode was the combo including from Mount Faber and Sentosa Station. Both good yet the first one is longer but Sentosa has more view. Still, this is a must for first timers. Najee was happy and this is one of the things he mentioned to me before hand."
,,Good fun,4.0,,"Lovely views, efficiently worked - queues can be very long. Best to buy fast track tickets but even then a fair wait."
,,Worth the Money,5.0,,"Long line up but it doesn't take long, the views are wonderful and well worth the money. Sentosa Island is fantastic and not to be missed."
,,This is the way to visit Sentosa..!!,4.0,,"Bordering on engineering feat and epitome of tourist attractions.. Singapore's cable car ride is undoubtedly one of the most enthralling experiences..

The ride starts from Mount Fabre station which is easily accessible through HarbourFront Metro Station.. The cable car drops you to the middle of Sentosa island with complete entertainment package in your hands..

The speed of the car ride is smooth and the view is splendid.. When the car crosses jungle at the city side and ropes over the sea in between, the bird's eye view of Sentosa island is near perfect.."
,,A great way to get to or from Sentosa Island,4.0,,The Cable Car is a great way to get to or from Sentosa Island. The views over the water are fantastic and worth the price. Taking the car back from Sentosa at night showcases the city of Singapore with the lights on.
,,Loved the ride and lovely view.,5.0,,This was a brilliant ride and you saw quite a bit of Singapore and it took us to Sentosa Island - lovely place to visit. would go again.
,,Nice trip,5.0,,I reccomand taking this trip. if you wish to visit Sentosa ispand and some other places from the island i suggest to buy a combo ticket with all the other activites because it'a a better deal for you.great view over the island.
,,Good view of the city,4.0,,"It provides a real great view of the city. kind of like panoramic view. Moreover, If you request you could have special dining on a cable cart as well."
,,Good experience,4.0,,Good ride. Not much queue even on weekends. We took the Mount Faber + Sentosa line. Both the lines were good. Would have been exciting if there had been some glass bottomed cars to make it more thrilling.
,,Worth a Visit,5.0,,"The main destination for the Singapore Cable Car is to go from the main city to Sentosa Park. Even if you are not planning to spend the day at Sentosa, this cable car ride is worth taking in. You'll get a great view of the city, harbor, and Sentosa."
,,Average...,3.0,,We did the cable car thing and have say most disappointing. There is little to see apart from some of the wonderful old houses buried amongst the forrest. Bordered on being a waste of both time and money.
,,If you go to Sentosa island this is the way,4.0,,Like a ski lift over the water that separates mainland Singapore with Sentosa island. Gives you a good overview and also let's you see all the tankers that are anchored outside waiting to off load at Jurong island.
,,Amazing Views of the City,5.0,,"Best view of Singapore from the Cable Car , specially during dusk time . Bit expensive , but worth it .Would recommend to everyone travelling to Singapore for the first time ."
,,Exciting View,4.0,,"If you Want to have a Bird Eye View of Sentosa this is the Ride which you need to take , though its a shared ride but you will love to see the view of sentosa"
,,"Expensive, but memorable experience!",4.0,,"If you have done a cable car ride before, don't bother. If you haven't, it is a must-do experience. Rather expensive at $29, but you could just go over to Sentosa Island by the monorail or the boardwalk, and catch the cable car there for only $13. The ride is shorter and you don't get to cross the bay, but it is still an awesome ride and you get some spectacular views, especially of the Sentosa beaches and islands. Being an enclosed car, it is not scary even for little kids."
,,Good For a First Time,4.0,,"Great little trip if it's your first time over to Santosa on the cable car but if you need to simply get to the island, take a cab. A lot cheaper and you can get dropped off where you like"
,,A Very Expensive Trip,3.0,,"The Singapore Cable car has been upgraded since we last visited.

The cable car runs form Sentosa island to Harbourfront terminal and then on to Mt. Faber.

The cable car is very expensive to ride - there are no one way fares and the fare for a return trip is $SG26 each - no discount.

As a result most people now take the monorail from the new Harbourfront terminal (some 150m away) - the cost is $SG 4 each way. The new harbourfront terminal is at the entrance to Harbourfront metro station.

At the Mt Faber terminal ther is no public transport form the top to the bottom - no bus service etc - so you either walk down the hill or catch the cable car back to Harbourfront. At Mt. Faber there is only an expensive restaurant - even the lookout is now closed and can not be accessed.

As a result the most popular route to access Sentosa Island is now the monorail.

However the view across the bay to Singapore is spectacular to say the least - but comes at a price"
,,"Nice view, can see the Citi and the resort",5.0,,"So nice place, to see the Citi and Sentosa resort.
Also very romantic if you wanna take dinner with your lover in the cab.
You can book over the phone make your lover surprise .
With the everyone you can enjoy good view from Mount Faber to Sentosa. And go around there by cable."
,,Nice view overlooking the harbour and Sentosa,5.0,,"Took the trip from Mount Faber down to Sentosa and back. Was pricy, but overall worth it to enjoy the view."
,,A great morning,5.0,,"This cable car from Mt Faber to Sentosa via Harbour front is a wonderful experience.Not only do you have the three stops above to explore, you have a new cable car which goes from one side of Sentosa Island to the other when you get there - this is included in the price and gives access to most of the attractions of Sentosa."
,,Great views and experience,5.0,,"While Sentosa Express is a faster option of reaching your destination at Sentosa Island, this one tops the chart for the stunning views it offers. The ride takes you over the docks and gives you a bird eye's view of the waterpark, beach Sentosa Merlion and entire Sentosa Island. Worth the ride.
P.S. - don't fall for ""ride with marvel characters"" charade and make your ride unnecessarily expensive."
,,Only to see veiw,3.0,,"I recommend Cable car only if you want to see the view of Harbour Port. There Cable Car rides one from Harbour Port to till sentosa isalnd and second is within sentosa island. from First carble car line (harbour point) also known as old line, you can see Port and sew with big ships and few part of sentosa island (resorts, water park). From other line (also know as new line) you can see almost all attraction points (all Beach, Tiger tower, Parajump etc ). You need to buy tickets both each cable car (together / separately/ one line). I suggest buy tickets online from local dealers."
,,Worth the time to visit,4.0,,To see the view from Mt Faber and then take the cable car to Samosa Island for the second cable is a worth while trip. Great for children. Get 10% off ticket if you show your boarding pass from Singapore Airline.
,,Don't blink or you'll miss it!,3.0,,You get a great view from the cable car BUT it's quite expensive and over in the blink of an eye! I'd say not really worth it.
,,The Best Way to Get to Sentosa,4.0,,"Although a little unnerving for those afraid of heights, this is a great way to see Singapore from up high. Lovely view out to sea and it's surprising how much natural garden there is to see on an island that is essentially a city."
,,Not unique but enjoyable-avoid going in the afternoon due to convectional rain,4.0,,Its ideal for viewing the port & parts of the thrilling Sentosa Island. If you are lucky you can pass on top of cruise ships docked near harbourfront station. Don't go in the afternoon if you are uncomfortable with humid conditions.
,,"Easy to embark, awesome views, well organised transport",5.0,,"When we arrived at the cable car station there was no line and we jumped straight on. The view from the cable car was spectacular. We were able to see more of the island (Singapore) and also had a great birds eye view of Sentosa as we arrived.

The cable car station on Sentosa is right at a complex where you can get on the free buses that travel around the island. Bus 1 took us to Universal Studios/resort world. They come every 10-15 minutes."
,,"Not bad, but forgettable",3.0,,"The best thing I remember about my experience riding cable car was spending a good time with my family/relatives in Singapore. It was more about who I was with, but the attraction itself was not that memorable. Sure, it was a quite nice experience to see how small Singapore is from above. It gave us a glimpse about this tiny country, the harbor, Sentosa Island, etc. But with the price we paid, it is something passable and better save my money somewhere else more breathtaking and memorable"
,,Amazing views and worth every cent,5.0,,Only AU$29 well worth it to see the fantastic views. Loved it and I'm scared of heights but this way anyone can see the sights. Loved it.
,,Great View,4.0,,"My wife had done this with her sister and girlfriend some years ago,so we were not disappointed great views and a easy way to get to Sentosa Island"
,,Amazing,5.0,,Just loved the cable car .Though a short 10-15 minute journey but breath taking views and just fabulous travel to sentossa.Recommend travel from Mount faber to sentossa
,,Very Nice!,4.0,,"The cable car ride is a unique experience which shouldn't be missed at all . It's a bit expensive but worth seeing as the ride is memorable you can use it one way see the beautiful sea below and the boats along side the pier..But 2-way is much better, as you can also alight at The Faber Peak for a quick nature walk."
,,Fun,4.0,,"We've been there to go to Universal Studios, and it was another way, to arrive and see other things."
,,Hello Sentosa!!!!,4.0,,"Fabulous way to go to Sentosa! I love taking the cable car going to Sentosa..... Nice view and smooth ride. There are even 2 more cable cars within Sentosa Island, but the best ride is coming from Mt. Faber going over the water to the Island. At Mt. Faber, take the time to check out the view from there and take photos! There's also a nice souvenir shop, and a restaurant."
,,Great way to get over to Sentosa,4.0,,"Although rather steep in price - $29 return adults, no family tickets - it's a good trip to see Mt Faber, Harbourfront and Sentosa. Once on Sentosa there are another 3 places on a different cable car line that your ticket allows you on.

Sentosa itself is touristy and tacky - didn't like it at all.

The easiest option is to start at Harbourfront as there is an MRT there which directs you to the cable car ticket office.

Good views on the way over but see a lot of the docks and building works."
,,No good just to go to Mount Faber,2.0,,"We were being jolly lazy and only wanted an easy way to go up to Mount Faber. We got the MRT to Vivo City and walked to the cable car station. We queued for 20 minutes watching staff treat customers with total indifference. We were then told we could only go up to Mount Faber if we purchased a SGD$26pp ticket that included the entrance fee to Sentosa Island - all tickets include this entrance fee, want it or not!
We overcame our laziness and walked up th small hill and back in about 90 minutes (at a stroll)."
,,wow,5.0,,"Well worth the money. Absolutely spectacular views would do this again in a heartbeat. Most staff friendly and helpful, one girl checking tickets was scary"
,,Great option to get to Sentosa,4.0,,"Definitely an option to get to Sentosa but be careful that you can get a cab back from Mt Faber since it's not frequented by taxis unless they have a drop off to make. View is quite nice but you see a lot of the port and ships rather than the beautiful bay alone. But you can get a real nice birds eye view of Sentosa going over some of the hotels, Universal Studios, etc."
,,Experience with views,5.0,,This was a terrific experience. The journey takes you over the sea and the views of Singapore and port are fantastic. The final destination is Sentosa which is a great day. Wear comfortable shoes as you will be doing a bit of walking. Absolutely worth the effort to get there. We did our own thing and not an organised tour and it was very easy. Thoroughly recommend this to anyone
,,Get all of your tickets to Sentosa from here,5.0,,Get your tickets for all of the attractions you want from the cable car as a package deal much cheaper than buying from the venues
,,unforgettable experience...Cable car,5.0,,"This is an unbeleievable ride ever. At such a height, u are suspended on cables...ufffffff great one. Intially u tend to get scared, but the smoothness of cable running and area around takes ur all fear away. Must visit when in SIngapore"
,,Expensive views,3.0,,"We found the cablecar rides to be very expensive, even when coupled in an attraction package. We were also put off because the staff assured us that the cablecars would run until 1:00am on New Year's Eve, but they closed them down early and we had to walk across the bridge instead. The views are fantastic, but the ride is short. I would recommend riding the cable cars back and forth a few times for the view alone so you feel you get your money's worth out of the ticket."
,,Magnificent Even in the Rain,5.0,,"Six of us of varying ages, mobility and degrees of height phobia took the cable car from the Mount Faber terminus to the far end of Sentosa and back. Part of the trip was during a tropical storm. Everyone enjoyed the views, the ride and the amazing weather contrasts. We all felt safe. Well worth the visit - whatever the weather!"
,,Evening deal unlimited rides,5.0,,"If you like seeing things lit up at night, it was worth catching the night-rider offer as it goes on discount and you can ride unlimited times to and fro (I believe it starts at 730pm). Lovely views and if you don't mind the up and down movement going past each pylon, you will enjoy yourself. It's a small cabin per cable car - 6 adults at most of average size and they should try to stay in their seats so the cabin doesn't become unbalanced."
,,AMAZING VIEWS!!!,5.0,,"This would have to be the BEST way to either travel to or from Sentosa Island. The views are simply priceless. We caught the MRT to the closest station then our SIA Holiday Stop Over package included return travel on the Singapore Cable Car to the wonders of Sentosa Island. You can take so many pictures from the cable car with views of the distant Singapore CBD, abundant bay and of course Universal Studios from the air!"
,,What a view,4.0,,"Loved , loved , loved this . Even though my daughter and I are afraid of heights we decided we had to go on the cable car , it was a very still day no blowing about of the cars so a perfect day . Staff friendly , we got a car to ourselves , very clean , spectacular view , reasonably priced would definitely recommend and we both agreed we would do it again ."
,,View from Cable car: PRICELESS,5.0,,"View from cable car is breathtaking particularly when you reach in the middle of your ride.

Behind me was skyscrapers of mainland Singapore and before me was jungle sand and natural beauty of sentosa island. Between the two islands was lying the blue sea providing a spectacular sight.

Don't give it a miss. This will be your most cherished memory of Singapore."
,,A thrilling ride,4.0,,Everyone in the car was just thrilled to bits. The view was really quite spectacular and the whole experience worth a visit
,,Amazing view!,5.0,,Loved the cable ride. We went over to Sentosa and travelled around in the cable car and the views were amazing. After our visit to Sentosa we up to Faber for a cocktails. Loved every moment of it.
,,Great views,5.0,,Great views In a round trip of Singapore and it Marina and the River - Sentosa island easy and systemic safe and secured
,,Expensive for what you get,3.0,,"I think this is one of the most overpriced attractions in Singapore. You can visit mush better attractions for Free. Like The Gardens By the Bay, Botanic Gardens."
,,great view and brand new cable car system. Those who fear heights will be very very comfortable.,5.0,,"My family enjoyed our first cable car ride. Great system they are running. However it started to rain heavily so we could only do the first half of the trip. Once we got off at the end where the fort was on Sentose Island, we could not get back on to return. It was safer just to grab the internal hop on hop off bus on the Sentosa Island."
,,Vey nice attraction,4.0,,"This attraction is a nice way to see a lot of singapore.
take the cable car from harbourfront, head up to imbiah look out and then back to sentosa.
try the glass bottom jewel box, really a lot of fun...but not for the faint of heart."
,,Great way to get to Sentosa,4.0,,"We got a train to the HarbourFront MRT and hopped on the cable car from the HarbourFront station. We arrived about 10:15am and the line for tickets was massive (we were there during the Christmas/New Year's period). And the line moved slowly. As we waited, the back of the line kept extending. If you're going to go in the morning, best to get there as early as you can. I think they open at 9am.

When hopping on the cable car, the car moves slowly along the platform so you have to hop on while it's moving. Probably not recommended for anyone with walking difficulties.

The views from the cable car were enjoyable. The glass of the car curves, so if you look behind your seat, you could see directly underneath you. Can be scary if you're scared of heights."
,,Sentosa and Harbor from top!!,4.0,,"We went to Mt Faber hiring a taxi and took a round trip to and from harbour front .

We see down and the view is amazing! Sentosa island on one side and harbour on the other. We were able to see universal studios, under water world and parts of sentosa and they were beautiful. The other side there were lot of tiny ships( they seem tiny from top) with lot of greenery and sea ."
,,Great harbour views,4.0,,"We took this cable car ride as a stop off the Hop On / Hop Off bus tour. Although is was Christmas time, we did not experience any lines, and had a fabulous view of the harbor on our way to Sentosa. Down side is either riding back up and waiting for next bus, or getting a taxi back to town, as this area is quite a ways away from the downtown area."
,,Great View,5.0,,"We took a taxi to the top of Mt. Faber and then made the round trip to Harbour Front and back. It was dusk when we started so we had the best of both worlds a view by day and by night. The trip is long enough for a decent view of the city, the harbour and Sentosa island. This cable car actually passes through an office building and over a rain forest. When the lights came on after dark the view was magical. There are good eating places at Mt. Faber for use before or after your trip."
,,What a way to see the sights,5.0,,"Little clear pods with a clear view all around, windows that open enough to let some fresh air in and a small fan to cool you down when it gets a little warm. Take the trip up to Mt Faber hop off and take a walk in the beautiful parklands. Wander down to the sundial that points out countries and things of interest. Hop back into your pod for the trip to Sentosa out over the Ocean, the resorts and pools. We hopped back on for the last part of the trip back to the half way point, but you can catch the train out from Sentosa if you wish. wonderful opportunity for loads of photos."
,,Clean and great views but expensive option,3.0,,"THe cable car trip to Sentosa island is generally offered as a complex option of packages with various multi-ride and or entry to various attraction on Sentosa. The views are great, however in our case somewhat subdued by weather. It isn't cheap and I understand that at peak times there can be queues. We we there in early JAnuary so the queues were very short. There are extensions over the length of the island which have lovely views over the beaches and rainforest."
,,Great way to get across to Sentosa,5.0,,Great park to wander around and then catch the cable car across to Sentosa. Not much of a line to get in and worth buying the Faber Licence so you can come back for multiple trips.
,,Nice experience,4.0,,One unique experience which you should definitely try at least once. Gives a very nice view of Harbour and Sentosa from top.
,,Aerial Highway,4.0,,"After arriving by Metro, the walk thru the Mall was short and easy directions to the ticket counter. Recommend planning your day and activities prior to securing Tickets. Both directions to island and the Mount is an easy ride and good view. Sometimes wait for the que line."
,,Amazing expe rience,5.0,,We used this to enter into Sentosa Island. It was an amazing experience for us and specially for kids. We could see some nice skyviews.........
,,Taxi problem,3.0,,The tickets are sold as return not single.....good job we wanted to go one way back to mainland which was great but at mnainland we waited 30 mins for taxi in the end went back and caught taxi from shopping mall at harbour stop but even then took another one hour but it was xmas!!
,,Expensive but great way to traverse Sentosa,5.0,,"It is an addition to the famous Singapore cable car, which was originally designed to offer a picturesque way to get to/from Sentosa. Now you can also go by separate cable line across the osland - from Imbiah lookout with 1 stop on the way to Siloso beach. Its priced separately but you can buy a joint ticket for main line as well

Great views"
,,Fantastic views,4.0,,We took the Cable car to and from Sentosa Island all I can say is what views. Downside the queue for tickets.
,,Beautiful views!,5.0,,Amazing 360 degree views day and night. We took the cable car on our way to/from sentosa day trip to universal studios. AC in the cable car and quite roomy compared to taking the mini MRT which is often crowded.
,,Short trip,3.0,,Short trip for value. Kids was a little bit scary!but u get a fabulous view. It should have the opportunity to buy just one way. But it probably the best way to arrive to the island
,,Good fun and great views,4.0,,"My wife and I had the great opportunity to travel to mount Faber on the cable car.

There is a couple of different lines to travel and the staff were helpful with advice on which route to take to get the most from the trip.

The cable car goes quite high, but the smoothness and comfort of the cars worked well to relax my wife, who is uncomfortable with heights sometimes.

We were lucky as it wasn't that busy, but I imagine it can be sometimes.

We spent a couple of hrs getting on and off the cable car having a look around etc, and we're glad we weren't rushed.

We had a good experience on the cable car and would recommend it if you have the time."
,,Great view of the city to Sentosa Island.,3.0,,"There was four of us that went there in a taxi up the winding hill to the venue. It was $30 per adult to get to Sentosa Island via the cable car. There is good ventilation in the cable car and lights for at night.

You can see a great span of the city and also the Sentosa Island. You go through one of the buildings as well."
,,Way to sentosa,4.0,,We rode this cable car located in Harbour Front Station. I think it was 25 Singapore dollars. It is a good experience but the trip distance was very short. It was hot when we were inside the cable car. It was noon when we got here. The cable car is made of glass.
,,SO MUCH FUN!,5.0,,I went with my partner on the cable car to access universal studios and the aquarium I had more fun on the cable car than them both! Well worth it as it was a highlight of our trip.
,,"Fast, but picturesque",3.0,,"A nice way to discover Singapore ""from the sky"", but I personally felt that it was a short ride for almost 30$. Although it's probably not a surprise since everything here is expensive."
,,Nice for adventurous person and no fear for heights,5.0,,"If you are afraid of height, this may not be a good choice as you will find it's not worth the money spent for the fear :) however if you love a nice view and like 'hanging in the air' this is definitely a good choice. You can reach the same destination without ride on cable car, i.e. hire taxi from Harbour Front :)"
,,Another way to sentosa,4.0,,"I ride cable car start from harbourfront station, its near vivocity mall. Its ride from 56 floor go to sentosa, its little scary for me but its fun n i can get beautifull scenery."
,,High,5.0,,"This is great cable car and although it doesn't climb as such it is very high , no queuing good fun and if I remember it had a glass bottom which added to the excitement great"
,,Average Ride ! Very expensive way to get to Sentosa :-),3.0,,"The cable Car ride is probably the most over rated attractions in Singapore. At 28 SGD for the ride, its the most expensive way to get to Sentosa. The view is good and the ride is nice but also very quick! The costs for the ride are extremely high according to me. Overall go for it as a tourist if you really like to blow money !"
,,Worth a go,4.0,,"Clean smooth cable cars, good view , expensive but worth a ride. U can have a aerial view of the things that santos a island has to offer"
,,Terrible,1.0,,"Not so impressive. no god view from cable car compare to other cable cars I experienced. Cable car is safe and fine, but unfortunately view is not so good. There are other places, where you can get great views."
,,Best view ever,5.0,,Absolutely loved the cable car the best view over to Sentosa it's worth the effort to ride over in the cable car.

,,Enjoyable ride,5.0,,We went on both cable cars the best is the one that goes from Singapore to sentosa! Very high hope you have a good head for heights or do not look!! Our 3 year old grandchild loved the experience.
,,Singapore Cable Car is an activity... Not just access to Sentosa,5.0,,"It was a delightful experience to have a bird's eye view of sentosa. We thoroughly enjoyed the access to fort siloso through the sky walk. The staff at the sentosa station was very friendly... Rest were most young kids, going through the motions"
,,Expensive Ride,3.0,,This cable car is the most expensive way to get into Sentosa. (SGD29) If you have never been in a cable car you can try this once. You can get the ride for a discount if you are buying Sentosa attractions pass. Alternately look for discounts offered by showing boarding pass of some airlines. View from the ride is beautiful but it is very short. If you are combining Malaysia and Singapore visit try cable car at Genting Highlands for breathtaking views for approx 2SGD
,,Excellent,5.0,,The cable car ride is a unique experience which shouldn't be missed at all . It's expensive but worth seeing as the ride is memorable you can use it one way see the beautiful sea below and the boats along side the pier
,,Sensational Ride,4.0,,Trying using the cable car one way so you can enjoy the views from a different angle too. This cable car is exhilarating and has breathtaking views.
,,Expensive but worth one visit,5.0,,It certainly is expensive at 29 sgd a person but worth one time. But to get into Sentosa you do t need this. There is the free MRT from vivocity to
,,Joyride,4.0,,"We loved the ride with the cable car from Sentosa to Mt Faber. You will have a very nice view overlooking parts of Sentosa,Harbor,Marina bay etc. We were lucky enough with the weather and could see quite far. Cable car was recently upgraded as well. Loved it."
,,Great view,5.0,,We thoroughly enjoyed the views to and from the island and it was worth the money. We paid to do both stops but didn't get out at the top of the mountain having read that there wasn't anything up there.
,,Spectacular views,5.0,,"Amazing Panoramic views of the bay, mount Faber, Sentosa and Merlion park. Watching the dolphins from way above is very interesting as is seeing people zip lining down to the beach. A nice way to spend some time and take photos."
,,Best way to get to Sentosa,5.0,,"This is the best way of getting to Sentosa. However, the tickets are return tickets. They should consider selling one way tickets too as there are other options too for getting out of sentosa."
,,Good Aerial Views,3.0,,If you already taken cable ride during your trip to Signapore-Malaysia-Thailand then you may skip this. This is gives you good aerial views.
,,Hope your not afraid of hights,5.0,,An exceptional cable car ride across the shipping lanes to Sanotos island. Miss peak hours for excellent views of the ships below.
,,A must ride for a cheap thrill,5.0,,"For SD$29 you can ride this thrilling cable car up to Mt Faber Peak and back down to Santosa Island. This attraction probably offers the best views of the Singapore skyline and the bay as well as Santosa Island.

Mt Faber Peak was fairly disappointing there's nothing really much to do up there but look at the views, eat at the restaurant and go to the gift shop that sells those happiness bells. For SD$5 you get two happiness bells that you can write on and hang on the rail that overlooks the cable cars and Santosa Island.

Santosa Island is the theme parks of Singapore wish we had an opportunity to hangout there but we only had a chance to ride the cable car to the Merlion in Santosa, but it was worth the trip.

This is a must do in Singapore of you get a chance. Breath taking and thrilling views of Singapore!"
,,AMAZING VIEW,5.0,,"Cable car coming out of a commercial tower of Singapore to Sentosa Island, about a sea arm. A stunning and unforgettable ride."
,,What a great place,5.0,,We got a cab to Mount Faber and got the cable car to the island. It was amazing. The island had lots of different places of interest on it. We loved it there.
,,Quite a view !,5.0,,If you have possibility you should take a ride with Singapur's cable train. It's allowing you to reach Sentosa Isld. The view is quite spectacular. It is also good to buy a package ticket to ride also on cable train located on Sentosa.
,,Best way to travel to Santosa,4.0,,"The cable car is the best and fastest way to get to Santosa or to mount Faber.
The cable links the mountain with the Santosa Island via top of a office building. Since you will most likely go for a visit to Santosa take this way and you won't regret it."
,,You really need a head for heights!,5.0,,"This is definitely the way to get to Sentosa Island if you don't have a problem with heights. You start off inside a building, move, lurch and suddenly there is a a lot of air below you and subsequently, sea. It is a fantastic way to go to the island. A word of caution, it broke down when one of my colleagues was on it on my recommendation. Turns out, he is not good with heights!"
,,Great way t reach santosa,4.0,,"If you are planning a trip to Santosa Island, take the cable car to get there - it is a great way to see santosa and Singapore from up above"
,,Great view of nice city,5.0,,Good experience to watch the city and the bay from the top of the town. Better to take unlimited ride if you have time.
,,Value for Money,5.0,,"Views galore! The trip lasted over 15 minutes, long enough to get some beautiful shots of the harbour. You really can not comprehend the length of this cable care until you are up there!"
,,Enjoyable for kids,4.0,,The cabins were clean and spacious. You can good views around the area but it isn't a cheap ride. Few stops for you to get off so do check with the ticketing counter where or how much it costs. You can get into sentosa via cable car but it's definitely the most expensive method. There is also a new round the island cable car at sentosa itself. You need to pay extra to take that. I think young kids will enjoy it.
,,Expensive but worth doing at least once,4.0,,"We live in Singapore and decided to get a family pass, which has turned out to be surprising well used. Riding the cable car is not cheap but is a very pleasant hour or so, and is also a fun way to get in and out of Sentosa (with the family annual pass you also get 'free' travel on the Sentosa monorail and the entrance by car as well)

Lovely views of the various sides of Singapore. Well worth doing at least once."
,,A must do experience in Singapore,5.0,,From Mount Faber you have Great views over Singapore and Sentosa island. It's a $10 taxi ride from the city to the cable car at Mount Faber and it cost us $26 each for the return ride to the island. It's fun and well worth the money.
,,Very nice views,4.0,,"Visiting Sentosa Island this is a very nice way to see Singapore from a higher place and see beautiful views. We took it as a part of a Sentosa Day pass for 5 premium attractions. It is interesting to combine it with other things (aquarium, Universal Studios,...). Very nice experience."
,,Great way to enter Sentosa,4.0,,"You can drive into Sentosa. Or you could take the monorail from Vivocity mall. The best way, is to take the cable car from Mount Faber or Harbourfront. They aerial views of Sentosa are amazing, enough to not want missing this amazing ride."
,,Don't miss this!,5.0,,"What fun! The ride and the views are well worthwhile. It sounds a little complicated but you get on at Harbourfront, buy the ticket for both Mount Faber and Sentosa, and then can get on and off each of the six stops. Signage isn't great on Mount Faber but head toward the peak early to avoid the tour buses."
,,So much fun,5.0,,"We did this one evening going over to Sentosa from Harbourfront for a meal. Absolutely loved it. When we got there we were pleasantly surprised to find they had a good deal on, but even if there had not been the special deal it was still worth it."
,,Fantastic views over the city,5.0,,We went over onto Sentosa Island just to do the cable cars on our last day in Singapore. It was well worth the trip. Stunning views over the city.
,,Fascinating views,5.0,,These cable cars will take to across to the Santosa Island where there are lots of attractions including Aquarium and Universal Studios. Fascinating views and not to be missed.
,,Fun fun fun,5.0,,It's a nice ride . beautiful view another good activity to do if you are visiting Singapore don't miss this out.
,,Good view,2.0,,"I recently went to take the cable cars to Sentosa, great view from Mount Faber but for a family with teens I thought this was over priced for how long it takes so we did not go as the flyer is cheaper."
,,Best view from the top,4.0,,"what i love from these cable train is the place very dramatic, we can see the forest , the sea, harbor , sentosa island as well becos is heading to there,
the staff is nice, the cabin is clean , and all is good, as always in Singapore you can got the best service anywhere.

Make you want try more and more , these attraction is the best if you want to singapore from the hight above the sea, and another chooises to go to sentosa rather u try train from vivo mall"
,,Excellent way to transport from city to sentosa,5.0,,"hello guys I just want to tell u that this cable ride is very cool and it has various type means standard cable car marriage cable car etc... and this cable car is so silent and very good view of the water from the cable car

I will also recommend this sight for those who are visiting Singapore
your should surely visit this car

thank you"
,,Wonderful Views,5.0,,We took the cable car from Mount Faber to Sentosa. It goes through the top Harbour Front which is it's only stop. It moves quickly but slows right down when you come in to a terminal. The gondolas are tinted & you bet lovely views all around.
,,A amazing way to reach Sentosa Island,4.0,,"The cable car connects Singapore to Sentosa Island. There are two stops in Sentosa, we took the car to the first one. The best part of the ride is obviously the view. The Singapore harbour on one side and water below, just beautiful.
Do take the ride to Sentosa!"
,,Another best of singapore,5.0,,"Recommended place, and best service to go to sentosa island. I recommended too order the ticket 1 month before if you travelling to singapore in peak season."
,,One of the best attractions in Singapore,5.0,,I have visited this attraction more than 5 times and I have not got bored till now. It's a must visit attraction if you are in Singapore. Recommend to take a two way ride with one in the day time and the return during the night time. You get one of the best views in SIngapore.
,,:-D,3.0,,A bit worry because I had a bit problem with higher but still fun to try. Sentosa island have many interesting things to visited
,,amazing view,4.0,,When going to the senthosa island there is 3 options one is this and this is bit expensive and didn't like to spend earlier but the view is amazing and need to go in this.
,,Nice View,4.0,,"A great way to travel from Singapore to Sentosa Island giving you a bird's eye view of the harbor, Universal Studios, and other attractions along the way."
,,Nice to try,3.0,,"The view will always be breathtaking, but it's not that cheap :p The normal tickets cost $29, we got ours at $18 from Sea Wheel Travel Pte Ltd at People's Park Center. The ticket is valid for a two way Singapore line (Faber - HarbourFront- Sentosa) and two way Sentosa line (the cable car line within Sentosa)

MRT HarbourFront, then follow the signs within VivoCity"
,,Love cable cars!,4.0,,"I love going anywhere by cable car whether it's up a mountain or over to Sentosa Island. You can take the MRT to Harbourfront and then follow the signs to the cable car. It is quite a walk down and up in lifts and escalators as you change from one building to the next. You feel as if you are being led up the garden path but hang in and you will reach it.
Once you get to ticketing it would help if you had already decided on what package you want. You can just buy the cable car ticket or include the cable car on the island as well as a number of combinations of attractions on the island. The cost mounts up quickly so be prepared for $$$$.
It's quite a short ride across to the island but you get great views over the harbour and the city as well as being a very pleasant way to reach the island. The fare is return so you can go back that way too."
,,Great way to visit,4.0,,With the capsules giving 360 views the Faber Peak to Sentosa Cable Car creates an experience that makes this a great way to visit the Island. As an added bonus there is a second cable car taking you over the bush clad portion of the island. On returning to Faber Peak we placed a happy bell on The Cafe's fence - great idea!
,,Feels like flying,5.0,,A safe way to fly over Singapore on your way to Sentosa. It offers great view of the harbor and its neighboring territories.
,,Roaming Sentosa,5.0,,You will appreciate how they make sentosa a tourist spot. A short happy trip seeing the beaches and resorts in Sentosa. Bring cameras with you and you'll be happy with the view on top.
,,Good value for a great experience,4.0,,The line for the MRT was huge so we decided let's get back a little differently. It was fun easily to use and quite an experience. None of us had a problem with heights and after going on roller coasters all day we didn't think much of the height but all of us felt the rush of getting to the top point when going over the harbour. We all felt this was a great experience. (Note: adult family not couples)
,,Excellent ... Views are fantastic,4.0,,Highly recommend this ! Our family walked short distance from MRT station to catch the cable car to Sentosa Island then back up to the end of the line back on Singapore mainland - Faber Peak Great views and quite relaxing !
,,Cannot buy a one-way ticket,4.0,,"We had used the Green Line Hop on Hop off bus from Suntec Hub to Sentosa and then the free Sentosa bus to the cable car station. We had planned a one way trip to Mount Faber and a taxi back to our hotel. We had to buy round trip tickets at SGD 39 per head which is expensive if you are not going to return. No matter, we were on holiday.
The trip across gave excellent views of Sentosa ( spoiled by the very large Resort World development which dominates the view) but mainly the Port of Singapore with the City Skyline in the distance. Glad we did it."
,,Great views!,4.0,,Great way to get to the island and get some awesome views at the same time! It can get a bit shaky if the wind picks up but thats part of the adventure ;)
,,Singapore City to Sentosa Island,3.0,,"Whilst on holiday, we decided to spend a day on Sentosa Island, south of Singapore City. We took the MRT tube to Harbour Front station and purchased tickets for travel on the cable car. It is only possible to buy return journey tickets - no one-way tickets are available. Cost in October 2015 - S$28 per person.
We boarded the cabin at the shopping mall and travelled across above the water to Sentosa island. After walking around the attractions and shops in central Sentosa resort, we then used the cable car to go to the beach area from Sentosa to Silosa and return. It is possible to leave the car at Mount Imbiah station to check the views from the observation area.
We then took the cable car back to the mainland and stayed on it until reaching Mount Haber, where there is a restaurant, shop and bar / bistro. The journey from Mt Haber to Harbour Front was included to finalise our journey and return to the start point. All of these trips are included in the price. There are great views to be had on a clear day, but when we travelled, Singapore was affected by heavy haze and the views were very restricted."
,,interesting way to enter sentosa,4.0,,"safe, cheap with great views. it starts at mt faber and takes you to sentosa . also has evening in-car dining options."
,,Fun way to get to Sentosa,5.0,,There are a few ways to get to Sentosa but this is the most interesting - it's the most scenic. Actually wished the journey was a bit longer!
,,Feels like Flying,5.0,,AWESOME!!! Riding the cable car is the best part of our Singapore Trip! That indescribable feeling as the cabin launch from the Faber Peak Station! Riding the cable from Mt Faber is a good decision. You may also ride the cable car from Harbourpoint but it will not be the same experience riding it from the mountain. The views are wonderful!
,,Nice View at the top...,5.0,,The view up there while riding the cable car is nicer because you get to see it in a wider horizon. You can see the shore by the Sentosa Island. It was nice feeling being on top. It just really made me happiest at the moment....
,,Quite a short ride,3.0,,I wishes It will be long ride and massive high up like Nongping in Hong Kong. It was little too short to ride on. The views was enjoyable.
,,Great views,4.0,,Another must do if you are in Singapore the views are simply outstanding and the price is great value as well.
,,Nice Singapore City views,4.0,,"Well, cable cars are always fun. And this one is no different. We too the one which took us to the Sentosa Island beach and return - not the one which goes to the Singapore city. It is a cool ride with a steep slope/climb and some great views. Recommended with family - time to take lots of pictures !"
,,Bread was stale,1.0,,"We are regulars here for over 7 or more years but tonight after returning from a long trip to Asia, all we wanted was an easy atmosphere and a burger. Not too much to ask. Burger buns were stale - tasted of mould. Asked for new burger buns. Still tasted of mould. By which time the burger and fries were cold so I asked for a hot burger and fries. So the second burger tasting of mould, over my original burger which was tepid with my original fries which were cold were delivered!!!! Time out!!! Very disappointed."
,,Poor customer service,2.0,,"As a local tourist, I must say that I am disappointed by the poor customer service. I was enticed to buy the family membership of $120. However on several occasions, I went up. There was no feedback on when the cable car service was closed for maintenance wasting my trip up to Mount Faber for the ride. Mimially, they should just sent some email to us to inform us about this so that we can be more playful and intentional in planning our trip or put it on the website. There was an occasion where I forgot to bring my own card. However, I brought my children's card. Hence, I asked for help as it was troublesome to go back home. They told me coldly to go home and that means 2 hours to come back to and fro. We gave up riding on that day. I asked to see the customer service manager and was told to take the lift. There were 3 lifts in the cable car towers and I just don't know which one to take to see the customer service manager. The customer service manager should be stationed downstairs to support the customer and not in some ivory tower. I hope thy pick on this feedback and improve on their customer relations"
,,Nice Aerial View,4.0,,The cable car provides a nice aerial view of the city... would suggest to go for cable car rather than the singapore flyer..
,,Cable Car,2.0,,"October 2015 . The Trip with the Cable Car is nice , and that is it . Mount Faber is nothing . Sentosa is like Disneyland , if you know it from before you will be shocked"
,,Magnificent view!,5.0,,"After a trip to the Sentosa island with many attractions like marine aquariums and Universal Studios, was this the perfect way to travel back to the center of Singapore. The view was breathtaking!"
,,This cable car crosses the sea and reaches to santosa International ships can be seen passing below us,5.0,,"Photographers generally take photos of all and when we take off on the other corner, we can see our photo on display board and if we want,we can purchase.A great experience. Both ends are especially santosa is a world class tourist place"
,,Sentosa Skyway Connect!,4.0,,Mount Faber offered interesting view of Sentosa with good food. The option is to take the cable car from Mt. Faber to Sentosa island and enjoy the traveling across the sea. The cable car closed at 10pm.
,,beautiful trip,5.0,,its a must see and intresting activity in singapore. it was a great view from the cable car and mind blowing experience. we used this cable car for going to sentosa island.
,,The fastes way to get on Santosa Island!,4.0,,"Singapore Cable Car overs the fastes way to get on Santosa Island and some nice views. However it is not so cheap. Together with tickets to two attractions it costed me almost 50$, but in the end of the day it was totally worth spent money.
Highly recommended for cruisers."
,,Great way to commute to Sentosa!,5.0,,"With a Faber License for my whole family or 4 as a reasonable rate, we could travel along the cable-car line from Mt Faber, Harbor Front Tower (formerly known as Jardine Steps) and Sentosa anytime of the day during its operating hours. You may also transfer to the new cable car line in Sentosa which is just 3 min walk from the Sentosa station. A great experience to travel at night as well."
,,Fly across Singapore to dreamy Sentosa,5.0,,if you want to fly over Singapore then you must hop on this one an exciting journey that ends up at the dreamy island of Sentosa.
,,my kids ............,5.0,,"my kids wanted to go there. i was so afraid ....... but you have to do what you have to do. the view is fantastic and i m sure the cable car is well maintained. clean, reasonable price, typical wonderful singapore ......"
,,Sky High View,5.0,,We took the cable car at about 11.55 on New Years Eve to take in the city skyline and watch the fireworks around Singapore. Great by day or night with views galore.

,,Exciting way to get to the island,5.0,,1st rate way to get to Sentosa. Much better o a clear day. Need a head for heights as this journey goes on for 30 minutes or so.
,,Fun way to get to Sentosa,4.0,,"Great and fun way to get to Sentosa. You get a bird's eye view as you slowly descent in the island. Make sure you save room for a ""Jar of Happiness"" if you plan to eat at the restaurant."
,,A Ride With a View,5.0,,Cable cars are always a great way to see an area from another perspective. The view is great and the ride is pretty smooth.
,,Fastest way to Sentosa,4.0,,"This is the fastest way you could get to Sentosa and the view of Singapore is not that bad either, I would think, despite of the haze when I visited. If you are tired of taking the MRT or LRT and want something different, this is the way to go."
,,A Bird-Eye View!!!,5.0,,"A very popular tourist site that starts at mainland Singapore island (on top of a hill named Mt Faber) that goes all the way to a man-made very popular tourist spot named Sentosa island. One gets a very good view of the the cruise centre, ferrry boats and the many attra tilns of Sentosa island. Worth a visit to this site!!! Price is reasonable. Facilities are above average too."
,,Great view over Singapore,5.0,,"The experience was great, excellent way to reach Sentosa Island in just few minutes with amazing view over the city and the sea. I will take this trip again when in Singapore."
,,Singapore cable car,5.0,,Wooh . It was scary sitting in a glass bottom cable car with south china sea below . But the beauty over comes the fear and we feel we are in heavenly bliss . Every angle is worth clicking with singapore port on one side . Sentosa island on another .a must must .
,,superhero cable car,4.0,,"A definite do.. even if you have done this many times before. Kids will love it, and its a lovely view going over the bay and parked cruise ships.
The best feature is that it gets you into the heart of Sentosa attractions. Google for mobile netowork company offers or credit card ones. Gets you a cheap ticket."
,,Good and well maintained-- but too short!!,4.0,,"Went there with family and friends during their visit to Singapore ... The ride is good, a lot better than my earlier experiences elsewhere, however it's too short and the view is not as good --- as you get to see a highway, a couple of Malls, a few ferries and a dockyard on the way ..."
,,Fun ride-,4.0,,"My family took the Cable Car from the HabourFront Station/Vivo City to Sentosa and also from Impiah Station to Siloso Beach Station, during our trip to Singapore recently. we could have taken the monorail or bus into Sentosa, but the kids wanted to ride the cable car. The kids really liked the ride and the view from high above. This was a great experience for the kids. I recommend the ride to those visiting Sentosa, especially those with kids."
,,Nice,4.0,,Went to this attraction with my family and of course the views are very good from high above. The only tip is there are two pricing and if you want to take the ride from Vivo city you will need to pay for the higher price. However if you just want to experience the cable car ride then you can opt for the cheaper option when you are inside the island.
,,"""Faber peak cable car""",5.0,,Breath-taking view you will surely love this thats why when you are in singapore you must try this specially for a couple romantic place.
,,"A little Pricy, very worth if First Time",5.0,,"The most spectacular way to enter Sentosa Island is this Cable Car. Rising up so far off the ground, this cable car has amazing views if the weather is right and if no haze exists. The price is $28-$29 and includes rides to both lines. This is:

Mt F - HbrFrnt - Sento - HbrFrnt - Mt F

And at Sentosa, there is another line about a minute walk way which is included.
You will end up at the middle of the 3 Stations. The stations is as follows:

Merlion-[]-[]-[]-Imbiah Lookout-[]-[]-[]-Siloso Point

Your ticket will includes these rides:

Im Lkt - Sil Pt - Im Lkt - Merl - Im Lkt

or the other way ^^^

Keep in mind, this is the steadiest cable car ever, it is so smooth its not funny. Anyone afraid of heights would not really be afraid of its movements, unless looking down internally hurts you a bit ! GL Have Fun"
,,worth the money,4.0,,"I had a day pass for the cable car, spend some time in faber park and also sentosa island. with the day pass, and both place, I had really nice experience. you should try at least once to try the experience because its really worth with what you paid and you have such fun experience."
,,Cable car splendour,5.0,,"Arrived at Sentosa station and discovered that we could go across by cable car. What a great idea! Did a detour to Mount Fabre and then back to Sentosa to carry on with our adventure. At the ticket counter we were advised of some great attraction offers within Sentosa and we got a great deal on a triple attraction which included unlimited cable car rides for one day, Universal Studios day pass and a SEA Aquarium day pass. We enjoyed the Cable car rides and visit to the aquarium. Heading to Universal Studios tomorrow. Got a good bargain with the tickets. All the staff were friendly and helpful and we enjoyed every moment."
,,Flying HIgh,5.0,,"We took the cable car to Santosa Island on a lovely sunny day just to experience the ride. Not only can you get the cable car across to Santosa but there is also a new cable car which runs the length of the Island so you can get a good overview of all it has to offer. As a person who suffers motion sickness I was a little concerned at taking on this venture, but I needn't have worried as the ride is so smooth and I didn't notice that there was any motion. Whatever else you do in Singapore don't miss this ride, the views are amazing, the ride is memorable and provides great photo opportunities. We really needed to do it again just to grasp the magnitude of all that was spread out before us, and we will do it again next time we are there."
,,great ride,5.0,,"From Santos down to the end of this cable car ride, jez, what fantastic views, could not stop trying to take it all in. Must do, no probs."
,,360 degree view..! Good way to get to Sentosa,4.0,,"There are many ways to reach Sentosa island..one of them is by the cable car, and its a must do ( atleast one way)..

The ride is fantastic, and the 360 degree view is also amazing !

There was an option of taking a cable car which had a glass bottom..we didnt choose that, but some tourists told us that its quite an experience !"
,,Great Views,5.0,,Great way to get to Sentosa Island and to enjoy fabulous views on your way... We had a really clear day so not sure what it would be like on other days... Had to queue for quite a while before getting on the Cable Car just because of the volume of people...
,,Wonderful views,5.0,,"We recommend this as a must on your visit to Singapore. The views are wonderful and it will give you an overall insight to Singapore. Make sure you go on a clear day or night to get maximum advantage. We also felt very safe and don't be put off by long queues, the staff are well organised and it won't take as long as you think."
,,Cable car Singapore,5.0,,To ride the cable car was an highlight of our trip. It was a fantastic way to get to Santosa Island. We got on at Hardbour City and found everyone very helpful. The views were great. It's a full day of seeing the island and many things to do excluding universal studies were there as well. Just brilliant.
,,Great way to reach Sentosa Island,5.0,,"Was wonderful to travel from the mainland, Harbour Front across the water to Sentosa Island by Cable Car. Journey took about 15 - 20 minutes with spectacular views. We paid for a package - there are various ones to choose and we firstly visited Sentosa and spent the day and then in the evening we travelled up to Mount Faber to admire the view and also to have a meal here. To see Singapore lit up at night was a spectacular sight from here! The ride was smooth and cable car journey was very comfortable!"
,,Perfect view,5.0,,Do not miss this travel experience when you are going to Sentosa Island! Buying a ticket is easy! (Not cheap.) It is a 5/5 and the view speaks for itself!!!!!!! :-) A must do activity! :-)
,,A must do when in Singapore,5.0,,I love this mode of transport. Its so serene and sedate. My kids loved it. If you have a fear of heights then think twice about stepping inside the small gondola. Magnificent views from that height and its a great way to get to Sentosa Island of course. I can imagine that weekends might see crowds waiting in line but we were there on a Monday morning so had a 5 minutes wait to get on board.
,,Great Views,5.0,,Beautiful views of the water and harbor. Great way to travel to Sentosa! Free ride to Faber Peak as well. You get 2 rides for price of one ticket!
,,Fun little trip,3.0,,Part of Singapores history - it is only a short ride though. Better to go at night and see the night lights of Singapore and Sentosa
,,Breath taking views,5.0,,From Faber peak till sentosa the car's mid air transit was fantastic....being early rewards you with numerous travel to and fro....vivo city is in the middle of the route....which is worth a visit..overall great experience. Must visit Tips: prices are high so choose wisely
,,Superb view,5.0,,Great slow motion experience and view of Santosa island a must view and do whilst your visit in Singapore. The cable car not just allows you to moving around the island but also lets you see all attractions around Singapore. Great with family.
,,Amazing views,4.0,,Quick and easy way to travel to Sentosa Island. It gives amazing views of the Sentosa island from the top.
,,Amazing But Expensive,4.0,,"The ride gives you a good bird's eye view of Sentosa and what is happening. However, When we went through one of the buildings where we have to show them our tickets, it was very rush for us. Other than that, I must admit, it was quite expensive but worth it."
,,good if you are going for the day or longer,4.0,,"we were a group of 4, 50 somethings on a full day private excursion. The cable car itself is well run, clean and offers good views. our tour guide had booked our gondola ahead of our arrival so we didn't have to wait. Also he had cheaper tickets than from the flier. We didn't find much to do on the Island in the short time we had. I'm sure that if you were staying there for the day or longer it would be better. Food and drink were limited and a bit pricy as they had a captive audience. Overall I would say that if you are on a tight schedule maybe give it a miss."
,,Good Views,4.0,,"Good views of the City, comfortable, clean, well maintained and on-ground staffs was courteous to passengers. Reasonable packages of entrance fees."
,,"3 attractions in one! Cable car, Mt Faber and Sentosa island.",4.0,,"Take a taxi up to top of Mt Faber, ride on cable car to Sentosa island and enjoy the numerous attractions there. A free guide map of the island tells you all you need to know.

Swimming in the sea is safe and the beaches are clean. Lots of places to eat/drink. You can hire bicycles, roller blades and kayaks."
,,Great Experience,4.0,,Just hop on to the Singapore Cable Car that provides an aerial link from Mount Faber on the main island of Singapore to the resort island of Sentosa across the Keppel Harbour.
,,Good way to see the whole Sentosa Island from the top,5.0,,This is a good way I'd recommend for traveling to Sentosa Island. It was a good experience to ride this thing and get to see the whole island from the top.
,,View from high up!,4.0,,"There is 3 station where you can board the cable car. Sentosa > Harborfront > Mt faber. View from harbourfront to sentosa was the best, as you will be able to view the whole Sentosa from high up."
,,Good experience,5.0,,One of the best cable car experience.have been to Malaysia as well but the view from here is beautiful. One should visit when you go to Singapore
,,Singapore Cable Car,5.0,,Oh wow this was amazeballs. Fabulous views of the city from the Cable Car. Extremely friendly people in Singapore
,,Good but pricey,4.0,,As part of our stay at Sentosa we did a round trip from the hotel on both the Sentosa a Cable car and the Singapore Mount Faber lines. It was a nice and easy way to see much of both Sentosa Island and Singapore but the round trip for 4 was nearly 100SGD.
,,Cable car experience in Singapore,5.0,,You will be amazed at the views you will come across if you take this cable car. If you are just two make the most of it. Overall an experience not to be missed if you are in Singapore. I bet you won't take just one ride.
,,"Scenic, Convenient, but Passable",3.0,,"My girlfriend and I bought a package for unlimited cable car day passes plus two attractions on Sentosa Island (we chose the Merlion and trapezing, but there are other options) for $50 each.

The cable car round trip is already $30, so this turned out to be a great deal!

The cable cars themselves are a mediocre experience, and didn't strike me as particularly unique. Mount Faber is not worth the cost if you are treating the cable cars as an experience on their own. It simply leads to a gift shop without much of a view.

If you are looking to do a full or half day at Sentosa Island, they're convenient for getting around. If you don't mind the heat and walking, skip out on the cable cars!"
,,evening trip,4.0,,we took this ride one night after dinner - was beautiful view as it was evening when we were on the ride.
,,A must do!,5.0,,"One of the best views I have ever seen. My jaw literally dropped in awe as I took in the view of all the ships and boats docked in the bay. Unfortunately the day my husband and I visited it was raining quite heavily but that didn't detract from
this superb attraction and excellent value for money. Would highly recommend for everyone"
,,Scary but great views,5.0,,"Great views, we went here a bout 5 yrs ago , we stayed on sentosa Island and took the cable car across to the mainland, brilliant experience."
,,Great view but worth the Money?,4.0,,"If it's just to get across to Sentosa, maybe not. But if you go up to Mt Faber and actually take an hour to walk around and then go back over to Sentosa, then maybe yes. It's a mode of transport and the photo opportunities especially as you come into Sentosa are great. You can also use the cable car on Sentosa which we didn't due to lack of time. It is certainly easy to get to if you use the SMRT to get to Harbourfront shopping centre."
,,great experience,5.0,,"It's a great way to go to Sentosa island.I'm actually scared of heights but I felt really safe in a cable car. My boyfriend and I took a ride at evening, it was really romantic"
,,A ride up the skies,4.0,,"There are many ways to get to Sentosa. But taking the cable car is definitely an option you should consider due to the very fact you are able to catch the entire view of Sentosa. Not to mention you get to have a glimpse of whats going on at Universal Studios Singapore. It's very safe and comfortable! There is also no queue at the rides at all!

My suggestion would be to take the ride at the night because Singapore looks really beautiful at night! If you are in luck you might even be able to catch the fire works display from Universal Studios Singapore :)"
,,Like A Fairground Ride,5.0,,"The check in person was very helpful and friendly as were all the other staff at the various stations. The cable car journey was like fairground ride and goes as high as a 30 storey building at one point so, as you would imagine, the views of Singapore are fantastic. Make sure you start early as the ride to Faber Peak and back after the sun has gone down is a bit dull."
,,Admirable view of sentosa,5.0,,Cable car is a way to see the view of sentosa and singapore as well. It's worth to try this activity. You will be able to vie the whole scenery of Sentosa. It's truly amazing. Wonderful!
,,Been there and done that....,3.0,,"I'm glad I did the Cable Car, its a great facility, I felt safe, there weren't any queue's, all in all a seamless experience.

My only criticism is that you have no option but to purchase a return ticket. We caught the car from Vivo Shopping Centre and would have been quite happy to purchase a leg to Sentosa Island, however the tickets are priced or inclusive of a return journey back to Mt. Faber and then back to Vivo Shopping Centre.

We ended up dropping the return component, the heat and activities wore us down and in all honesty, it was too much effort to return to the Cable Car Station with the nearby Monorail calling us instead.. I can't fault the experience however, just not enough of a wow factor for me to journey all the way back to the return point after traversing around Sentosa Island."
,,Great Views,4.0,,"Though there are various other ways to reach Sentosa, taking the cable car from Mount Faber is a fantastic option! It is really comfortable and gives you great views of the outskirts of Singapore city and the Beautiful sentosa Islands! Also these cable cars literally go through a building. How cool is that ?!"
,,Great way to visit Sentosa Island,4.0,,Spending some time in Singapore means visiting Sentosa Island. A great way to see Sentosa is from the top via Cable Car. We walked to Faber Peak station for the whole trip. It is really worth it!
,,Stunning Views,4.0,,We rode from Mount Faber to Sentosa Island and the cable car is a fantastic way to see Sentosa Island as a whole. I would definintely recommend this as the views are brilliant! The car itself is very stable so no need to be worried - definitely worth a trip!
,,Amazing views,5.0,,"This is really good attraction. Feels very safe. We bought an unlimited ticket and did multiple circuits on both cable car lines and in between we wandered around Sentosa island. Excellent views of lush green rainforest, siloso beach and the waterpark. Very relaxing."
,,A Phoenominal View,4.0,,"It's a good ride for seeing from a high place down to Sentosa and you can surely take a lot of pictures during the ride, but remember, the cable car is not air-conditioned and there're air vents gap in cable car so don't put ur hands out of the cablr car when taking pic or ur phone/camera with fall away. Also it's expensive with SGD29 for Adults and SGD18 for child, so buy tickets from TripAdvisor or other retailers."
,,Stable Cable,5.0,,"I was a bit concerned about travelling on this but didn't need to be worried. The cable car is stable - great for anyone suffering from mild vertigo like me. Very scenic, shame it was so short. Staff were really helpful."
,,Lovely way to Sentosa Island,4.0,,"If you're heading into Sentosa Island, take the cable Car from Mount Faber, its the starting point and takes you right into the island. Lovely views. If you're using the cable car coming back from the Island, easier to get off at the marina as you'll be able to pick up a taxi quicker.
Recently updated cars and you can also take the cable car that;s on the island"
,,Fun way to see Sentosa Island and the vicinity!,5.0,,"We loved the entire ride, but especially the ride to the top of Mt Faber where the views were amazing. We rode halfway during the day and the other half in the evening and highly recommend it!"
,,Cable car to Sentosa,4.0,,"Love the ride up the side of mountain to Mount Faber, great views coming back then takes you to Sentosa Island."
,,Amazing view.,4.0,,"Fantastic view... This cable car is probably the highest in the world, it literally feels like you are in the clouds. It last quite a while so you are getting a lot for your money."
,,MUST get on to go to the Island!,5.0,,"This was such a great experience as I had never been to Sentosa Island before and the first glimpse of the island was from the cable car. SUPER NICE VIEW!! :) I ended up going this past Monday which was right after the Jubilee weekend and they had an option for residents to go in for free but there was a huge line, so I ended up standing in the wrong line like a moron lol...but still the Experience was everything!!! $29.00 for tourists."
,,The best view of Sentosa and Singapore,5.0,,The view was amazing and its an experience not to miss if you are a visitor to Singapore. The lush green mountains and the full view of sentosa islands is great.
,,Nice ride,4.0,,The cable car ride is nice. You can fit about 5-6 people in a car and it goes to Sentosa. It does have a higher cost than the tram. It is round trip to the island and back. It is worth doing at least once.
,,Not cheap but worth the experience.....,4.0,,"There are few ways to get to Sentosa but none beats the experience of a cable car ride.

You get that wonderful feeling of being high up in space- so peaceful & yet not very far from humanity as you can see the landscape & buildings below.

For those who are afraid of heights, suggest not to take the cable car. It can be nerve wreaking especially when strong wind blows & the cable car just swing 'loosely.'

Weather here can change very quickly from hot sun to sudden rains. Can be scary up there when it rains suddenly & you have still not reach the station.

But this experience does not come cheap. Especially if you have a few persons. Book online for promotional offers, which will save you some money."
,,Above it all...,4.0,,Worth doing. A great way to get above the streets and see the coastline and city. Note very expensive and a simple way to get around... rather than always taking a taxi
,,A great way to travel to Sentosa,4.0,,"We caught the cable car from Mount Faber over to Sentosa Isl, as well as taking the one on the island itself.

It offers great views over the island and is a fun way to get over there, however, it's not as efficient or cheap as other options. Mt. Faber is a little out of the way, so you either need a car, catch a bus or take a taxi to the station, and then back down again when you return, adding to the cost of the trip.
If you want a novel way of traveling and want the views, then this is great fun, otherwise, use the monorail or other means of transport to the island"
,,Timeless view from above,5.0,,Riding a cable car going to Sentosa is priceless! You will enjoy the 360 degrees view of Singapore. A must to do in Singapore!
,,Excellent Views from above,5.0,,The price of this cable car is worth it especially if you combine it with the Mt Faber cable car you can get them cheaper than the retail price. If you have never be to Sentosa then go at least one way by cable car and enjoy the fabulous views good photo opportunities and you can continue to take the cable car around sentosa to enjoy even more views from above. You can even get a photo taken of you as a memory of your ride.
,,Nice view,4.0,,"Lovely views over Singapore but there was nothing to do when we arrived at Mt Faber, other than having something to eat or buying a sovenir."
,,the best way to visit sentosa,5.0,,"if you go to sentosa, I suggest this cable car. especially, if you ride on cable car at 6 or 7pm, you can watch sunset."
,,Out of the earth experience,5.0,,"Probably the best way to get into the Sentosa Island. It's remarkable and out of the earth experience, as you zoom through. Scary though - but very reliable."
,,Good view but expensive,3.0,,"Great view but $65 for one adult and two kids aged four and six was a bit expensive in my opinion. Went on a weekday so no queues,"
,,Take in multiple viewpoints,4.0,,"A fun and convenient way to get to and around Sentosa Island. Great opportunity to take in the lay of the land from multiple viewpoints. There are multiple stations were you can alight and have a good around on the ground. The first time ever that I have encountered such blatant anti-tourism price discrimination. You will pay a SGD 10 premium if you are a tourist.
ROUND TRIP - Cable Car Sky Pass - Standard – Adult 29.00
ROUND TRIP - Cable Car Sky Pass - Local – Adult 19.00"
,,Great views above a scenic area,4.0,,"Enjoyable ride and a great view, good way to get to Sentosa Island which is also a great place to chill out. One of the must do things whilst in Singapore."
,,Could be worth it!,4.0,,"If you're just going to universal studio don't bother but if you're going to explore the island then it's worth it. For S$29 you get a return trip in the cable car onto the island AND the cable car on the island itself and that makes it worth the money. I wouldn't recommend spending the extra S$10 for unlimited use.
The queue for tickets takes about 30mins, but thats because you can buy tickets to attractions at the same ticket desk. There is very little if any delay getting onto the cable car itself."
,,Actually would've given a higher review but...,3.0,,"The views were great, the ride smooth, and the staff friendly. My problem was that when we took the cable car from Sentosa back to Faber Peak, it was about 5PM or so. We were waiting about 15 minutes for a taxi. The attendant said she would call for a taxi. Another 10 minutes and no luck. However, there were many personal cars and busy taxis driving by. Finally another attendant recommended we take the cable car towards Harbourfront. Then from there, get a taxi. It would've been nice if we got this heads up earlier.

So the attendant explains to the other attendants our situation (there were 4 other families waiting with us). We finally arrive at Harbourfront. We however needed to walk a little bit to make it to the taxis. Once we made it to the taxis, we needed to wait over an hour. There was a line queued, so we lined up as well.

Once again, I'd give the cable cars a 5 digit, but the fact that they never gave us a warning really bothered me."
,,Lovely view,4.0,,The cable car definitely is the most scenic way to get to Sentosa Island and worth doing but beware of the lady in the ticket booth as she was so pushy in trying to make us buy extra things we didn't want. It was really annoying and I had to get stroppy with her to make her stop.
,,Pricey - but Views are Fantastic,4.0,,"Worthwhile experience to see the views over Singapore, but it is rather pricey. But everything in Singapore is expensive anyway."
,,exciting and good value,5.0,,I had the combiantion ticket for all cable car rides: 29 singapore dollars. If you want unlimited cable car rides beware that it is only for one day. So arrive early! In that case it is good fun for children for only 10 dollars a person more. Locals and children pay less. The line for the tickets is long but once you are through you don't have to wait anymore.
,,Mesmerizing!,4.0,,The Best ride ever! Loved the View. Will surely come again! Awesome ambiance! Good Service! Memories Lasts Forever! Service is excellent!
,,Fantastic View,5.0,,Great view on the Singapore from the comfort of your cabin. Can be quite pricey but so worth it ! Just make sure you're not scared of heights! Best way of getting to Sentosa island.
,,Worth it,5.0,,"Fabulous view, very cheap and stunning part of the world, save money and use the food court before boarding to sentosa. Recommend visiting coastes bar when getting to sentosa."
,,"Great views, great fun!",4.0,,"A decently long ride for a cable car, with amazing views as you ride across from the mainland to Sentosa. If you, like me, enjoy panoramic views from high up, this is definitely worth a ride. There is also a cable car museum. The restaurant at Mount Faber at the beginning of the ride is very good too.

I have given 4/5 because it is pricey - better to wait to buy when there is a good discount available."
,,Great fun,5.0,,"Be prepared for a fun and long ride! I don't remember riding such a big cable car b4, from Faber Mount to Sentosa, including the go through the building thing... The family really enjoyed!"
,,wonderful experience,5.0,,"Though a little expensive but a great experience as it offers spectacular panoramic views of the city. It is the best way to get to the Sentosa island :)

would recommend the one which is with the glass floor, as then u get to see the view as well.

A must when in Singapore!"
,,"Easy, best view, a great way to travel",4.0,,"I bought the tickets online and included 2 attractions. It was very easy to find the location via MTA and the line was short. We had a great view of Singapore and Sentosa Island as we traveled across the water. The shipping yard and sheer number of ships in the water was amazing to see. The nice thing was that with our ticket we were able to take the cable car across Sentosa Island, which was a great way to see the whole island quickly. Also, the ride home at 8:00pm was very nice. The sun was setting, the moon was coming up, and the cable cars were lit up with lights. It was a nice way to end the day.
Nice bathrooms in all the cable car stations."
,,My favorite mode of transportation to Senthosa,4.0,,"There were 2 types of cable cars, the one without the glass on the floor and the one with. Go for the one with the glass because the view is just amazing. It's a lovely ride and a must try."
,,Relaxing and scenic,5.0,,There are 3 stations where you can disembark/join this ride. It's a very calm ride that takes you from Sentosa Island to the main city and back. It gives you a towering scenic view of certain areas including the sea port and even other Sentosa attractions like Universal Studios and the SEA Aquarium.
,,Not all that good,2.0,,"For the price, I was expecting something special and was rather disappointed. The views from Faber peak were not all that spectacular. The views of Sentosa Island were OK but it would have been better to be on the island itself as the cable car ride was a somewhat detached experience"
,,Great ride!,4.0,,An absolute must when in Singapore. The view is great but the experience and the momentum that builds as you see all the island come to life in front of you is fantastic.
,,Sky Ride,3.0,,"It is a good experience and but not an awesome ride. you get to view the different angle of Santosa island.The ticket is expensive though , but can be compensated with the nice view once you are up there. You can get off at different place which was a plus point."
,,Great Views,4.0,,"Great views of the Port, City and Sentosa Island. Hop off and have a walk at the top of Mount Faberfor great city views, and on Sentosa Island to check out the attractions. We caught the Gondola from just next door to Vivo shopping mall with its huge selection of retail and food options. Easy access by MRT (Harbourfront) or bus."
,,The best way to travel to Sentosa,5.0,,"Catching the cable car from Faber Peak to Sentosa has to be the best way to get to the island. Terrific 360'c views and the ticket included the other cable car that traversed Sentosa.
Not sure if this is well known option for O/S travelers but is a must do.
Just catch a taxi to Faber Peak to start your experience."
,,Must Ride Event,4.0,,One of the greatest events in SENTHOSA Island and they have expanded the length of the cable car. Now you can ride inside of the senthosa island. I prefer to have this event in the evening because of the view that you can see there.
,,For all those who visit Santosa,5.0,,"It is away from the city and one has to plan well to come here . The cable car is a must have experience for all those who come to Santosa Island . Not for hurried traveller . There is hefty price of the ticket .for the tide .,"
,,Using the cable car after a long absence.,5.0,,"We had not used the cable car since 1996. What a lovely experience to use it again after so long. We stopped off at Mount Faber for a couple of drinks and overlooked the view below, Sentosa in one direction and the CBD in another. Full value of the ticket included the cable car to Sentosa and back. It also allowed us to use the cable car on Sentosa whilst we were there. A good day indeed with lovely weather to help us enjoy the sights."
,,Worth the Vertigo,5.0,,Great views and very efficiently run. It feels quite high up but the views are worth it. So much to see and Sentosa is a wonderful place to spend a day.
,,Incredible views,5.0,,"We got a taxi up to the Cable Car, which was JUST perfect, and then we managed to get on and see Singapore from a completely different perspective. Definitely worth trying out, and taking a camera!"
,,Great Views.. a must do!!,5.0,,I wonder why this attraction does not show up in the top 5 things to do in Singapore.. I had a blast with every ride on the cable car.. I took their day pass which allows you to take any number of trips on any route.. they have 2 route.. one inside sentosa and one goin to mount faber (across the sea) .. the views are breath taking.. also the guy at the ticket window explained everything in detail and gave us some ongoing deal on the day pass..all in all.. a great experience and a great way to see Singapore from Top! :)
,,Well worth while ride and views as yet another part of the Singapore Experience!,5.0,,"Spectacular quality ride on new roomy and strongly built cablecar gives a fantastic experience! Easy travel from the top of the hill down to Sentosa Beach, with the incredible panoramic views of Singapore. Very comfortable even for the faint-hearted! ."
,,Fantastic Views,4.0,,"The cable car was a little expensive but offered fantastic panoramic views of Singapore. We took a return trip and had a walk at the top of Mount Faber, albeit that the mount was little more than a hill."
,,Awesome ride,5.0,,The cable car offered a fantastic view of the sea and the landscape below. We went for two rounds and it was great.
,,A must for a family...,5.0,,"My family & I had a great time because it was a long ride from sentosa to faber then back to sentosa and not to mention the views, too."
,,Definitely a must do while in Singapore,4.0,,Both the internal Sentosa cable car & the one from Singapore to Sentosa are great. The only improvement would be air conditioning or better placed windows to catch the breeze but most cable cars are the same.
,,Chill & Thrill,5.0,,"Enjoyable , Safe, Attractive and Visitor Friendly Activity in Singapore. While Air Borne, the Panoramic View of City's Horizon, Flora and Fauna add up to a Remarkable View. Peak season sees a greater influx of Tourists. It's a Great Connection from City to Sentosa Island. A Thrilling JoyRide Fun for Everyone !"
,,Amazing views of Singapore,4.0,,"We opted for the scenic route into Sentosa via the cable car, and it was so worth it. The views over the city and the bay are breathtaking. An amazing experience to try at least once...but definitely not for those with a fear of heights."
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,"This is one of the things you must do when in Singapore. While the Mount Faber Road starting point is not so convenient, its easy to jump in a taxi and get there.

Buy a one way ticket not a return. Once there try grab a cable car for yourself and partner or friends. They are small so really you dont want to be crammed in with some strangers. The trip is really great and about 10 to 15 minutes. Nice views over the harbour.

When you arrive sentosa I suggest head to the beach and have a drink in one of the beach Bars. Life does not get much better than this.

Take the monorail back to Vivo City shopping center. There is an amazing food court on the top floor so you could finish off this trip with a nice lunch."
,,Spectacular views.,4.0,,"We started at the Mt Faber end & did the 2 trips. 1st to Sentosa Island then the Sentosa Island Cable Car then back. Pretty reasonably priced at $28 SGD for the 2 & well worth it! The views, particularly heading down to Sentosa are spectacular. When we got off at Sentosa we meandered around the attractions before catching the cable car for the island itself, again the views were amazing. If you've got the time do yourself a favour."
,,Challenging My Acrophobia - I Envy Tom Cruise,5.0,,"although i have acrophobia, it’s a worth of trying to complete the journey in Singapore with different types of transportation. it was my first time “flying high” with cable car, i really enjoyed it; and from now on, with this wonderful experience, i think i will give another try with other cable cars on my next journey in other places. i envy"
,,pretty good view,3.0,,nothing special but worth it..it takes you from the mountains to the universal studios park where you can spend the day. nice sights.
,,View from a whole different level,5.0,,"Spectacular views. A nice relaxing ride from Sentosa Island up to the mainland. Seeing the island and area from this location cannot be beat. Be sure to enjoy the views from the top, tie your bell to the gate and ring the giant bell for good luck."
,,Sunset Ride,5.0,,It's highly recommended! Try sunset experience! We did two ways one to Faber Park which basically enjoy the sunset above the city line. Add up another way to Sentosa Island means sunset over the island harbour. It's too short nor very long.
,,The best views.,5.0,,Probably the best views of Singapore from the cable car. The cars are very comfortable with panoramic views over the whole of Singapore. The journey takes about 15 minutes and is a bit scary if you don't like heights but it is well worth it and an ideal way of travelling to Sentosa Island and the Universal Studios Amusement Park. This is one way of getting lots of aerial view photos of Singapore.
,,Never in my wildest dreams,5.0,,"I have a fear for heights and anything that hangs in the air! I was amazed at how comfortable I felt I. The cable car despite the fact that it was pouring with rain and lightening and thundering! I love the view from above, spectacular! Worth every cent!"
,,Cable car,5.0,,"Had a amazing time taking pictures, kids were trilled with the ride. We were to Universal studios via cable car. What an amazing experience. Totally loved it!"
,,Magnificient view!,3.0,,"Interesting view and experience. The feeling u get when the cable car leave the building and fly through the sky in a glass cabin accompanied by the wind. However, night ride is more recommended and avoid afternoon rides."
,,great view,4.0,,"After a nice walk and great lunch at Mt. Faber , the trip with Cable Car is just what you need to complete the day. Great view over the city and nice experience."
,,Cable car to Sentosa,5.0,,"Brilliant views over the port, sea and Sentosa. Great way to get into Sentosa and an exciting experience for those unused to cable cars."
,,THe Thrill begins,5.0,,"Amazing views ! The wow factor begins in the loo in the cable car station which has has quirky achitecture which is a lovely surprise and a fitting way to begin the cable car trip. You can see the bay ,the city and Sentosa all at once. We saw a cruise line parked below us while the car was moving and it was great fun !"
,,Mt. Faber to Sentosa island - worth the experience!,5.0,,We went up to Mt. Faber and took the cable car to Sentosa island! We came via their Sentosa train back into Vivo City Mall. They have a restaurant up at Mt Faber and lots of lush greenery where one can take long walks or jog up to the top or back down. It is quite refreshing and the view is awesome overlooking the city. The cost for the Cable car one way was about SGD $26 for each person. Not cheap but worth the experience.
,,Enjoyable Ride,4.0,,This cable car ride is really enjoyable. One can see spectacular view of Singapore city from top. You can reach SENTOSA Island from Mount Faber safely & gently. You can take beautiful snaps of Singapore city. Ride can be particularly fun for kids of all ages.
,,Worth a Ride,4.0,,"This is a very good ride to experience. This can get you directly to SENTOSA Island from Mount Faber, within no time. Ride is smooth. You can see amazing top view of Singapore City & that of SENTOSA Island."
,,Spectacular !,4.0,,"As the title suggests, a trip across the water on the Singapore Cable Car, is indeed, Spectacular.
We did it at night , which was great , but I'm sure it would be equally as good , during the daytime.
I wouldn't recommend it for the faint hearted though.
As with most things in Singapore, it's relatively expensive , but a ticket can be purchased as a package deal , combining several other worthwhile attractions, which makes it more affordable..recommend !!"
,,Nice way to get to universal studios,4.0,,A little pricey for a 10 minute trip but it was nice anyway. Would be good if we used the cable car in sentosa aswell but we were just heading to the attractions and didn't have time to explore sentosa.
,,Skyhigh,4.0,,"This cable car is amazing and another way to get you to Sentosa Island, besides the road/causeway. Fantasic view looking back to the Island as well, There are now two cable car skyways in this area."
,,A ride Above,5.0,,"This is a fun way to get to Universal Studio's..you get a bird's eye view of the resort and surrounding areas,,the view out to the sea,,you can also visit the Butterfly Gardens at the top of the Gondola Ride before you go on to the ride down,,"
,,nice views,4.0,,it is a half hour ride by undergroumd to get there. But even the trip to get there is worth the experience of the singapore underground. The cable car goes to Sentosa Island with its fun park which we did not visit. But go up to Faber Mountain for a relaxing walk around and maybe a drink at the restaurant with nice views on parts of Singapore you otherwise would miss.
,,santosa island cable car,5.0,,"Great view in these cable cars, we went from santosa island in the cable car and it went through a building at was fantastic, highly recommended."
,,Wonderful Experience,5.0,,Awesome car experience. Really quick and gives you view of whole city. It takes you from City to island. Must do thing on Singapore. Please check timings at counter.
,,Good views but look out for offers,4.0,,Check out of there are any credit card promotions for this attraction...we managed to half price which makes the ride a reasonable price. I guess if you are visiting its an attraction that is on the list...Good views travelling and from the Jewell at the other end...dont bother to stop half way..
,,Very good,4.0,,"We bought cable car passes and universal studios pass. We took the car to the ""bell of happiness"" this was a lovely place to stand and reflect on things looking over the city. Then we took the cable over to the island it's a good way to get a view of the city and work out where things are. I was surprised that the cable cars weren't air conditioned only down side. Good was to get about and we didn't experience and long queues."
,,cable car ride,3.0,,This is a ok way to get one place to another If you have not done it do it. There is nothing wrong will this ride but it is only average way of spending a couple hour of your day.
,,Awesome View of Singapore!,5.0,,"A must ride! Take a cable car from mount Faber until Sentosa Island. There is a lot of option like cable car dining option, fly with superhereos apps. Recommended!"
,,Arrogant people and Bad Service,1.0,,"Very bad service! Arrogant people working there! Purchase a ticket , it says ""Package is available from 7pm daily"" ! No mention closing time! At 21.40, Was surprised they were about to close and did only one way from Habour tower to sentosa!!"
,,It was okay but expected more,3.0,,"My wife and I went to Sentosa and enjoyed our time there and we wanted to return on the Cable Car and were surprised that price was for two way only. We think people should be able to pay a cheaper price for a one way trip.
The view was okay but we got a better view of Singapore from the Observation Deck on top of Marina Bay Sands."
,,Good views and good way to get to Sentose and Mount Faber,4.0,,"Good service, good views and the entertainment options are interesting. It is expensive but where else can you get this experience with these views?"
,,Breathtaking views,4.0,,it was a wonderful experience. Breathtaking view from Sentosa to Mount Faber. I would definitely recommend this ride especially if you're first timer in Singapore it's a must try attraction.
,,"One word ""wow""",5.0,,"We went on a organised tour which was in my opinion value for money ,included visiting some attractions and a meal? Going on the cable car gave you great views but if you don't like heights this may not be for you. The laser light show was fantastic this was at the beach another great show was the pink dolphins.
,"
,,Fantastic veiws,4.0,,"If you like heights then this is the place to see far & wide...
Excellent ride
Make sure you have heaps of time
To enjoy the area . So much to do... So little time!!
We had special tickets & to get these redeemed was a nightmare...
No one knew who would or if could redeem them, we found the service of ticket issue to be confusing & frustrating."
,,Once is enough,3.0,,"The cable car in Singapore runs from Sentosa to Mount Faber. It provides nice views of Sentosa and HarbourFront and the wider port area. It could not be described as exciting though. I thought it was expensive for such a short trip but worth doing once, but not something which I would pay to do again. Best time to go would be around sunset for the views."
,,Simply wow...,4.0,,"If you are in Singapore, do try this. The cable car not just takes you to the sentods island in a unique way but also gives you the spectacular view of the city. Do try this, you will really enjoy..."
,,Okay for the fainthearted,5.0,,Not a fan of heights but this was manageable as it seems to be much solid than the one in Hong Kong. Will definitely ride again as gives a nice view of Singapore and suitable for the fainthearted like myself.
,,Another view of Singapore,4.0,,An interesting and different way to view an area of Singapore. The ability to get off and on at different places is also a plus. One of those 'must do' things in Singapore.
,,Simply amazing,5.0,,The experience is simple amazing. This is a must visit ride for anyone visiting Singapore. The view from the cable cars is simply breath-taking.
,,Travel to the sky,5.0,,"We travelled from mt faber to sentosa in the cable car. The cable car has 3 stops overall. The cable car starts from mount faber and ends in sentosa island. It is one of the means to travel to sentosa.
The station at mt. faber the highest point of singapore has lifts and escalators to take us up to the cable car boarding point. Toilets are available in the station. The cable car doesnt stops for us to get in but we can board easily as it travels very slow in motion. Take a note of which stop you have to get down as if u get down in the wrong one u cant get back again. The first stop is harbour front near the vivo mall.
You can enjoy a great view when u cross over the singapore bay and just dont forget to look down on the ships below and the high rise buildings farther back. Once you cross harbour front station just look below to see the adventure cove park rides and sentosa island. We just loved the cable car and even those its a bit expensive do give it a try."
,,New Experience,4.0,,It was really fun and new experience. It is the most enjoyable way to go to the Sentosa island. Very much recommended for the first time visitors. The view is really amazing and you can take beautiful photographs of this amazing view.
,,Loved the cable car.,5.0,,Really enjoyed the cable car experience. Loved looking at the museum of the cable car. Mount Faber great place for a drink. Don't forget to check out the toilets unbelievable view from the toilets. Well done Singapore
,,Sky Journey,5.0,,"Boarding at Harbour Front, we took the journey to the Sentosa. The views are terrific and the kids enjoy it a lot. Moves at a slow pace, there are wonderful oppurtunities to click photos. The cruises below and the panaromic view across is breathtaking. The journey ticket is inclusive of return and you need to follow the directions to approach the cable station which are quite simple.
The staff is co.operative and its a great way to approach Sentosa Island. Just skip the taxi/bus and have a memorable time."
,,Just a means to travel..just ok,3.0,,This is taken to reach Santsoa Island and it is a good experience and not an asewome one. But you will have a good view of the whole Santosa island before landing there and that's the best part.
,,Awesome Ride,4.0,,"It takes you over the river , to Mount faber. Really romatic ride.The next destination being the amazing Sentosa Island"
,,Great fun,4.0,,"We got a taxi to the cable car, what great fun. Amazing views our daughter really enjoyed her first experience in a cable car. Wouldn't recommend if scared of heights!"
,,not that great,3.0,,"The motivation behind the link auto ride is with the goal that you can see the perspectives of Singapore and Sentosa Island. Be that as it may, its really pricey about $25 for a grown-up ticket. It goes really speedy and actually, I didn't think it was justified regardless of the cost however, by and by. Verify you go on a sunny morning too, shady day and you essentially squandered your cash."
,,Worth the trip,3.0,,"The actual chair lift is quite fun but it is the short walk up to the look-out that make the trip worth while.
I do think this is over-priced however.
Avoid the tourist trap as you get off the cable car - the food is also no good and over-priced."
,,"Special if you are a first timer on cable car, otherwise just an verage experience",3.0,,"First things first:
There are two stations in Singapore from where you can get onto this cable car, one at Faber Peak and another at Harbor Front station (Vivo city mall). I took it from Harbor Front station.
I took it on a weekday and there was no queue for tickets. You can checkout combo tickets if you are visiting other attractions at Sentosa. Ticket is expensive IMHO. You will get a return ticket only. I am not sure if they have one side ride tickets.
Now, if this is a your first cable car ride, you sure gonna enjoy this. Though the ride is quite short, but the view of the ocean below will surely lure you into photography. You also see an overview of whole Sentosa island, and its various attractions.
If you have been to cable cars before, then there is nothing special for you here. In my opinion, you can very well skip it.
What is the fuss about superheroes, I did not understand. They provided few masks and badges with tickets, you need to download some app on your mobile, I did not know what that is all about and it did not attract me do go into all that downloading etc."
,,Not that great,3.0,,I haven't found that great...u can just find a view of harbour...for the people who are not having any experience of cable car before may find this exciting..
,,phantastic view,4.0,,"from the cable car you have a phantastic view...dont forget your camera...and it is a interesting alternative way to go to Sentosa...i like ti see the harbour and a part of the city from this perspective..well, nice...but its not cheap...."
,,"Short trip, save your money",2.0,,We went over on our way to universal studios and paid $29 each. I had been looking forward to this but after five minutes it was over and on the way back I got just as good a view from the train. Which doesn't cost anything. Give it a miss
,,Nothing new about it,3.0,,"Singapore cable car is just another cable car, nothing new about it. Only difference I found is it passes over a busy city. So if you have been to some good cable car ride in Swtzerland or some other place around, it's not worth spending money."
,,"Sentosa island is not very interesting, but its cable car enables having a nice view",3.0,,"Sentosa is not worth a visit. The view of the harbour and of part of the city from the cable is very good, but the ticket price too expensive."
,,Short ride make you avoid roads,4.0,,"We had an excellent trip into the Sentosa with Cable car, the boring journey via road changed to an excellent scenic view.The ride was quick and fun but was really worth it.We boarded from mount faber and from the moment we sat in our cable car we knew we were going to have a fun day.The ride is safe and does not stop even while getting in so if you have more guys like us get in fast and begin your happy journey.If you were travelling with kids like us its one ride to Sentosa you don't want to miss.We also saw the decks and pools of the cruises waiting below and almost the whole island could be seen including some of the dolphins playing with people below in dolphin lagoon."
,,Great for a full panorama of Singapore,5.0,,"Despite the hefty price, this is really great to have a full panorama of Singapore, including the harbour, between Sentosa island, huge tourists trap without any interest, and Mount Faber. Highly recommended indeed. A very good surprise to us."
,,Great fun and great views,5.0,,"We joined at the Sentosa end and went across to Harbourfront Mall that links to Vivo City. We didn't bother to go all the way to Mount Faber as time was short and there didn't seem to be a lot there apart from the view (could be wrong on that though). The cost was a flat SGD29 for the round trip (even to Mt Faber) but there were concessions and family tickets. What a great view! Very high and goes over Resorts World.

I would definitely recommend doing this."
,,Okay,3.0,,"Great aerial view of the river - very slow and bumpy ride - having experienced the cable car in Cape Town, South Africa, this one is unfortunately a bit average."
,,Worth a visit but nothing special,3.0,,Enjoyed the cable car ride and views from Mount Faber of Singapore. The ride took us to Sentosa. We had to use the free bus service to get around Sentosa Island. Cable car ride was nothing special - not very high or long but worth a ride. My only comment would be that the price was high for a relatively short ride.
,,Nice!,4.0,,"The Singapore Cable Car takes you to Sentosa Island. It is a nice ride with spectacular views and great chances of taking stunning photos. Do not buy packages such as Cable Car + 2/3/5 attractions as the attractions in them do not worth a visit, maybe only the tiger tower does."
,,Its a nice way to get from point a to point b,3.0,,"Faber Cable cars take you from Faber Park to the sentosa waterfront mall (aka VivoCity) and ends at Sentosa Island. Its a great way to see the waterfront and the attractions at Sentosa (Universal, Waterparks etc.) .

The developer however tries too hard to make the ride the attraction offering vip cars, dining cars, and fly like superhero cars for this 15 minute ride from point a to point b. Its an enjoyable activity and a good price for the trip. Be aware that returning from Mt. Faber is at the end of a road. You will need to use your phone to secure a taxi, and there is no real convenient MRT (subway) stop."
,,Panorama of Singapore,4.0,,"Don't miss this place on your itinerary for Singapore! Where you can see how nice panorama of Singapore through Singapore Cable Car. Take a look for Santosa Island, Harbour Front Terminal, etc. Beside singapore it self, you can see a bit view of Indonesia, specially Batam island from here."
,,Average experience,3.0,,I had an average experience because the cable car goes too slow that you might spend half of your day in a cable car rather than going to your preferred destination and enjoying like: Universal Studios Singapore Adventure Cove Waterpark
,,Fun!,5.0,,"Bit tense for someone who is afraid of height. Loose yourself in the beauty of the view surround,then you're going to love every bit of its journey.
Worth every penny, and comfortable too.
Staffs are also nice and helpful.
You can either go to sentosa or mount faber with this cable car. Or even both!"
,,Great entry to Sentosa Park,4.0,,Really fun way to get to Sentosa Island. Purchased Universal tickets at same time which was very convenient. Great views and photo opportunities.
,,Bird's Eye view!,4.0,,We have travelled with family fr Mt Faber to Sentosa. very amazing view of Harbour and Sentosa resorts.The hill view is lush green and contrasting the harbour view with Modern Jungle of roads building and bridges. Must on itinary
,,Great views,4.0,,"We purchased tickets for the cable car and two attractions at Sentosa, the tickets gave us unlimited rides on the cable car until 9.30 pm , and we utilised this to come back in the evening at go to the restaurant at the top.
The cable car offers great views of the city and is a pleasant quiet way of spending time in Singapore."
,,"Fantastic views great experience, well worth doing",4.0,,"We really enjoyed this experience however the attractions at the end of the ride to the bay area are much more for the younger element or young families. We opted to go back up the cable car ride and stopped half way by the Cruise ships and walked around to the bar front area which was very pleasant to sit, have a drink and watch the world go by... and the tourist boats etc. Not bad value for money and the views are amazing, well worth a visit"
,,A view to summarize Singapore as an efficient country with effective plan to use a small land.,4.0,,"The title was a quote from my foreign visitor on the cable car. He just saw the southern view on the Singapore Flyer and a few days later, seeing the busy harbour, the highest hill and sentosa (the man made island for leisure) from the cable car. I drove them to Mount Faber and parked. Walked them to the viewing points to see Hdb flats in Henderson area before we bought return tickets for the cable car to sentosa. Car parking was free so I need not worry when I should return.

The cable cars are new and very comfortable. Don't compare the view with Hong Kong, Europe or usa mountainous views. This is simply for viewing what Singapore is. If you are an international seasoned traveller, you might find it boring n short, but if you want to see what Singapore is and how this small country can prosper, this view very much summerise it - efficient, neat n orderly and with the knowledge and technology to build it. First time cable car experience would be great.

We passed between two office buildings at harbour front and soon headed towards sentosa. The seasoned traveller was unfazed while the regular traveller was full of praises. As for me, I last rode on it decades ago and was amazed by the great improvement and comfort. It would not be fun skipping mount Faber, I recommend full journey. ($29 per pax). I took the cable car at about 9.30am when the weather was cooling. But was surprised that the return trip at 1pm remained comfortable and cooling.

As we had limited time to move around in sentosa, the nearby Merlion was a good stop over.
Highly recommend visit on weekdays at early hours to avoid the crowd and noise.
The cable car does not come to a halt but simply slow down for alighting n boarding. Ask for assistance if quick movement is not possible before you buy the tickets. I did not see any handicapped sign so please call to ask if there is special arrangement required.
If not driving, take a train to harbour front (cable car at tower 2). Or take the cable Car from Sentosa."
,,Loved it!!,4.0,,"Had a blast on this. The view was amazing and its spacious. We picked the wrong day to go on it though as it was raining and winding, but it didn't ruin the experience."
,,Birds Eye view of Bay Area and Singapore...........,4.0,,We took the to and fro journey from Sentosa Island to Mt. Faber and back. You can also do it as a one way journey. You can take the ride from / to Mt. Faber or the vivocity mall. I would recommend taking it from Mt. Faber as this is a great peak with superb views of Singapore. Helps you to spend some time at Mt. Faber. The cable cars gives excellent views of Singapore.
,,Pumps up your adrenalin,5.0,,"Used the cable car to reach Sentsa island. The cars are well maintained and the staff efficient and friendly. As advised by my guide, first used the car to reach Mount Faber and I had all the car to myself in this leg. Utilized the opportunity to take photographs and video as I liked. At the turn around at Mount Faber, the car got filled to its maximum allowed capacity with a group of Indian tourists and I being a Sri Lankan lost no time in befriending them. We had a great time enjoying the scenary down below. The roads, the high-rise buildings, and the bay area in a miniature scale was fantastic. Halfway through, the car rises up to its highest holding tower which gives you an adrenalin rush. Thereafter on its descent to Santhosa, you could see many attractions in the island, and I especially remeber the Dolphin Lagoon with the Dolphins swimming in it. The ride is a bit expensive, but if use the round trip like me, you could make
the maximum out of it."
,,Good if using to visit to Sentosa,3.0,,"After doing a couple of really good cable car rides in Vietnam we expected a lot from this cabe car ride in Singapore. Whilst we enjoyed ourselves for the short rides to Sentosa and Mount Faber it really isn't worth a trip just on itself.
It would be good to combine with a visit to Sentosa.
Also at Mount Faber they are missing a trick, they should have a viewing platform of the city with picture opportunities for tourists who visit. All they need to do is allow a viewing platform on the roof and it would be amazing."
,,Don't look down,4.0,,"A great way to get to Sentosa but it is so so so so so high up

We did the entire trip over and it was fast and the cable cars clean and well looked after. The trip provided an amazing view of both Singapore and Sentosa Island"
,,flight over the bay,5.0,,the singapore sentosa cable car is always a pleasure to ride and is an exciting experiance everytime
,,Great view of the local area,4.0,,had a return trip on the cable car after spending a day a Sentosa.. Nice and smooth ride with great views of the local area. A must do when in singapore...
,,Wonderful,4.0,,"Wonderful. The Cable Car is spacious and stable. A great way to see Singapore from above, the busy city, the wonderful buildings and beautiful waterfront area..... We usualy ride the Cable Car To/From Sentosa. The Kids love it.....!!!! A bit expensive but......worth the experience."
,,Good,5.0,,A bit pricey but its good to go in it especially at night so that you can see the view of the beautiful city beneath
,,Not as good as we felt it could be,3.0,,You climb a building up a lift and pay for the ride . Yes it's d c app ready but not as it looks on the advert . Kids would be disappointed . We got the cable back to the hill top and it's not well served by taxis and we were told by a taxi driver this is common .
,,Overpriced very short cable car - you can easily walk,3.0,,"We were surprised by the price of the cable car, and were disappointed that it was so short. You can easily walk up to the mount Faber, likewise you can walk to Sentosa or take the little tram connection. So if you are on a budget: skip the cable car.
Spectacular though when you go over the cruise ships when coming from harbourfront, going to Sentosa"
,,a nice way to enter and leave Sentosa Island,5.0,,"A fun way to enter and exit Sentosa Island for our family. Great views, and we used the super hero photo app, was a bit tricky but made a fun photo when we figured it out"
,,"Love, LOVE This!!!",5.0,,"This was my first cable car ride and I absolutely loved it. It was surprised trip to Sentosa Island. It was terrific to ride between 2 office buildings, the ocean, the city, the freeway and a mountain. The entire ride was with breathtaking views and a great experience. This is a great thing to do in Singapore and I will definitely do this again!"
,,Great view and terrific way to go over to Sentosa,5.0,,We went by cable car from Mt Faber to Sentosa. It was a great way to travel and gave us a terrific view of the side of Singapore that you don't see from the Singapore Flyer. The ticketing and boarding process was quick and efficient and the ride was smooth with spectacular views
,,Breathtaking Views of Singapore!!,4.0,,Worth all the excitement we had since the first time we had seen it from the Singapore Cruse Center!! Really Breathtaking views right from the word go.. we stayed at Sentosa and on our 2nd day took a bus to Imbiah and from there the cable car to Mount Faber and Back.. The Beautiful views of Singapore from the top at Mount Faber and the butterflies in the stomach on our way back were a never forgettable experience!!
,,Great way to travel,4.0,,"We went over to Santosa Island and decided to use the cable car. What a fun way to travel. Not the cheapest or quickest way to travel, but the views are great."
,,Awesome,4.0,,We took the cable car at dusk which was really fantastic as the lights came on and the sun set . Really gorgeous views. A must do if you're in Singapore.
,,Best way to get to Sentosa,4.0,,"After considering all options to get to Sentosa, we decided that this was the best way.

We chose a time of the day (11am) where it wasn't too sunny and hot to get on board from Harbour Front Tower 2. The ride was scenic and the light breeze and smooth ride made this a really comfortable experience. We were also one family per car and it was a very intimate trip.

Despite the amazing experience, we however would like to suggest a little guide or map on board that points out the landmarks or a little introduction of the scenery. Such as the stunning architecture of Keppel Marina, short history of Mt Faber, different attraction of Sentosa from up top etc. (we had to google them all after).

Packaging the cable car ticket with some Sentosa attractions would have also been ideal."
,,Enjoyable ride.,5.0,,"A slow ride to Sentosa Island, this is the best option to see the attractions there including the Marine Park, Universal Studios, Resorts World and the Butterfly and Insect Park. It affords sweeping views of the city in the absence of mountains."
,,Scary but great views,3.0,,We were alone in the car which was good and the trip over was great with splendid views over Sentosa Island.We were able to see that the island would be great for families as the main attractions are water slide themed.We did not get off as we were caught in a sudden squall and the car was swinging badly.We were happy to sit still and get back as soon as possible.It was an expensive scare at £15 each!
,,Great Views,4.0,,"A brilliant way to travel to Semtosa Island. On the day we visited only round trips at $23 per person were available. As there were few people around, it was one couple or family per car. Brilliant views and a great experience."
,,CABLE CAR,5.0,,It is a great experience. Excellent cable car ride from world trade center to Sentosa Island. It is very well designed for a distance mainly for all ages of enjoyment. Kids will definitely enjoy in the cable car.
,,Scary but worth doing!,4.0,,"These singapore cable cars are safe, but it's scary. But if you can get over your fear, there are awesome photo opportunities on a clear day, as you go over to Sentosa Island. Do try and get a whole cable car to yourself because you'll get more out of the experience. A great thing to do in Singapore."
,,Pensioners fly with superheros too,5.0,,Visited for the day and rode up and down with all the superheros ( for the grandchildren of course)......staff very understanding of the old lady who wanted to wait for wonder woman's carriage. ...beautiful place and beautiful people .
,,Up and away i fly ?,5.0,,Brilliant way to get to Sentosa Island. Leaving from Mount Faber or MFLG Harbour Front Tower 1. Good Value and great deals and great views.
,,Come fly with the Super Heroes,4.0,,A relaxing journey over to Sentosa island with a super hero theme that our little boy really enjoyed. It is also a chance to take in some lovely views of the Harbour & island.
,,Amazing experience!!!,5.0,,The greatest experience i ever had!!!! Taking a ride with these cable car while you are having a dinner is the best choice!!! The view of the island is fantastic!!!! Don't lose it!!
,,great way onto Santosa Island,4.0,,If you are thinking of going to Santosa Island I defiantly recommend taking the cable car from the mainland down across the water to Santosa Island. great birds eye view and very effiecent.
,,A fantastic way to get to Sentosa,5.0,,"3 stations: up in the hills, inside a CBD building and on Sentosa island. You get to see the city, the water park on the island, the greenery,"
,,Great if you like heights,4.0,,Good to go all the way across. No good if you have vertigo. You can see plenty from up here. A good day out.
,,Incredible view in both directions!!,4.0,,"This is a must for any traveller to Singapore. Sentosa Island is a place where you could spend days and days and, once there, the cable car provides a great end to the day.

While not cheap, the view is spectacular. You can hop and off and spend time or simply take the trip from start to end and back again.

Warning, there is another type of open cable car. Make sure you choose the ""Singapore Cable Car"" for the full experience"
,,Good way of seeing the views,4.0,,nice way to see the view and get some good pictures but quite expensive. We did the flight until the end of the line in Singapore and the night skyline was beautiful.
,,Very short distance,2.0,,"The view was OK, but very short distance. I think it doesn't worth the money. Better choose Sentosa Express to go to Sentosa Island and you can also use it on the island too."
,,excellent value,5.0,,"Smooth fun ride with the superheros,well worth the money,we went to mount faber then over to sentosa,really good day"
,,Sentosa Access,4.0,,"A great way to get to Sentosa. Take a taxi to the Mt Faber station and head over. A return ticket costs about the same as one way, but on friends advise we did not return by cable car as there is no taxi rank at Mt Faber and did not want to get stuck. From the station on Sentosa there is ready access to the monorail and bus services. Or just walk, nothing is far."
,,Nice trip,4.0,,Took the cable car to Sentosa Island and it was a really nice way to see great views of Singapore. What made it fun was the interaction with various superheroes associated with each cable car. You need to download the app before boarding. The queue was quick and the trip very pleasant and relaxing. Certainly a fun way to get to Sentosa.
,,Great view,4.0,,Nice view in going to and from Sentosa area. Great experience to be with the group to enjoy more of the cable car ride since it can accommodate maximum of 8 persons.
,,Views awesome,4.0,,"Our daughter love this ride and getting a character car was her highlight, she got green lantern, and superman. We had no line ups was quick and easy to get on, although every one wanted to check our ticket. We didn't get off at the park stop we keep going. We got this as part of ticket combo, double check your combo pass as we realised you get a free scoop of ice at the mount Fabre station, don't forget to do this. We thought it was a little bit $$ but then we got to Sentosa and that is even more $$$. We enjoyed the ride if we come back to Singapore we wouldn't do it again. It's someone we can say we have done. Oh cable car museum was pretty cool."
,,Not to be missed!,5.0,,"This is an exciting way to obtain a brilliant Birds Eye View of Singapore and, in particular, Sentosa Island"
,,superb+++,5.0,,The best way to explore the picturesque of Singapore is through these cable cars. Its affordable especially if you are going to purchase combo tickets.
,,expensive and very short ride,1.0,,"so so so so not worth it. the title says it all.

free pins and masks wont even cover for the price.

should have ust taken the bus or mrt or cab going to sentosa which would have saved me money and time. there's even no view to see.

totally not worth it."
,,Queued for well over an Hour and a Half,3.0,,"The queue to buy tickets is a nightmare the cable car is very good, the cars are spotless and the views are great. However the system for purchasing tickets is very un Singaporean, people pushing in, the system is not policed and only two people selling tickets.
What a Shame."
,,overpriced,3.0,,"Singapore Cable Car offers a stunning 180-degree view of the Southern part of Singapore west coast precinct with its apparent enclosure. Provides an aerial link from Mount Faber (Faber Peak Singapore) on the main island of Singapore to the resort island of Sentosa across the Harbour. Selected as a premium gateway, Singapore Cable Car offers a premium and differentiated experience for visitors to Sentosa island’s attractions. The cable car system is another world's first with its glass-bottomed cabins If you're heading to Sentosa or Mt Faber you may wish to travel by the cable car, and enjoy the views...one set back is the ride is overpriced."
,,Cable Car ride,4.0,,Trip was great with the kids. Two found out they didn't like heights. View is brilliant and then there are all the attractions on Santosa Island
,,Nice view and smooth ride but rather costly.,4.0,,"As many reviewers have noted, the ride is somewhat expensive. However, it does give you a very nice view of the Southern part of Singapore stretching into Sentosa. If you are taking this midpoint from the World Trade Center area, the signs can be rather poor if you are approaching from the road side. In fact, if you walk into the office building from the road side, you will certainly miss the ticket office and have to come down again. The lines at the ticket office can be rather slow moving as ticket buyers are frequently trying to puzzle through the kind of packages for the rides they plan to take. I felt that it could move a bit more efficiently. It is relatively easy to get on and off the cable cars..so don't worry about it."
,,Good view but short trip,3.0,,A bit over priced and short as quick as 3-4 minutes. The view is nice but in short it's not worth the money.
,,Good Panoramic View,4.0,,"You can take the Singapore Cable car from Mt Faber to go to Sentosa or by bus, sky train or taxi.

Once in the cable car the view is panoramic and serene. You can also see the surrounding islands.

For special occasion you can reserve a carriage at a certain price."
,,Reach Sentosa Island in style...,5.0,,"The Cable car is WOW. We were a family of 6 adults and 1 kid in one box and it was absolutely fantastic. The ride is comfy and long and you can stretch your hands out as well. The views are really awesome from up there. Make sure you get into the cable car fast as it is continuously moving. Rest the staff will take care.

If you can get a monopod as I did, you can take some amazing photos and videos.

Tip - Just when you are about to enter the boarding area, there are 2 huge life size statues of Batman and Superman. Keep your cameras handy...."
,,Highly recommended,5.0,,"My and my partner had a great time in singapore. We enjoyed several thing in modern singapore. we loved sentosa and its atmosphere. we didi few things in singapore . we took the Singapore cable car to reach the top of the hill. the view from our cable car was so beautiful,we can see beaautiful singapore, marina bay,harbour,and huge whole singapore city and lastly a good dinner at the top.
we love it.

,,A nice way to get to Mt Faber & Sentosa,4.0,,If you're heading to Sentosa or Mt Faber you may as well travel by the cable car & get nice views. It's reasonably priced & comfortable.
,,Worth the trip for view,4.0,,The round trip .. or part .. is good viewing experience but was surprised at how expensive it is now ... and no senior discount May explain why rather quiet
,,Awesome,5.0,,"you can see so much from this high up, we caught the free monorail from our Hotel, to The Imbiah stop, had a look around there too...always something to see no matter where you are on the Island, got back just intime before a thunderstorm..a must do when in Singapore"
,,Amazing view of Sentosa,5.0,,We took two ways cable car to enter and leave Sentosa. It was an awesome experience.Here we can seethe man made island with the height of technology.4-D adventures -Log ride and Journey to Adventurous island is a must visiting Sentosa. These rides are unlimited if purchased subject you have to keep the wrist band untagged till you are in sentosa.
,,Great views of Singapore and Sentosa,5.0,,"We took the boardwalk onto Sentosa and then cable car up to Mount Faber, and back to the Waterfront. 8 seater cars, we had one to ourselves, very stable even traversing the pylons. Great views down the Straits, Sentosa Island and Downtown Singapore. Get to the top and there is good food and drink at the Spud and Apron, operated by the same company where you can sit and enjoy those views. Weird that the tickets are Sing$29 whether you take a single, return, get off half way, whatever......but we made best use of it!"
,,"Views, views and more views",4.0,,"The cable car ride takes about 16 minutes and is a self enclosed cable car with a small open window type space which enables you to have great photo opportunities. We started at Mt Faber and went across to Sentosa, had a coffee, went through the Butterfly park, then returned to the halfway point and took a taxi to Clarke quay. The views enable you to have a good overview and the views are panoramic- the ride was worth it for the views. The lady at the Mt Faber ticket office was very friendly and helpful ."
,,Scenic ride,4.0,,"We took the Singapore Cable Car to experience the ride and to enjoy the panoramic views of Singapore. Not as a means to get to Sentosa Island, which is really a place we didn't want to go. We hopped onto the cable car at Harbourfront Center and opted to head first for Mt. Faber which offered us more wonderful views of Singapore. It was very quiet up on Mt. Faber. We walked to Mt. Faber Point where we saw our second Merlion (the first being the real one at Singapore River). We got back on the cable car and rode down to Sentosa Island just to see what's there. If you're with children and you like theme parks and rides, then you probably will like Sentosa. We just looked around and caught a glimpse of the Sentosa Merlion. The Cable Car ride was a fun experience, especially if you haven't been on a cable car ride anywhere. It's something any first time visitor to Singapore should do. Anytime in the morning and afternoon would be a good time to do the Cable Car ride. We'd say there's more to see in the daytime."
,,Great views,5.0,,Worth doing the cable car. Ride from top of the mountain to Sentosa was about 10-15mins. Staff was helpful & friendly.
,,Panaromic View,4.0,,Singapore Cable Car offers an amazing view of Sentosa Island and bay area. One can see huge part of Singapore from quite a height. It is really beautiful.
,,Nice views,4.0,,"Going to Sentosa on the cable car is always fun. One thing to be aware of, is that they are trying to sell you a lot of attractions for a ""special price"". Make sure what you want to do and see, and then work out if it is worth buying the special or not. For us it worked out cheaper to buy at the different attractions. Overall a good experience."
,,A Bit Disappointed,3.0,,This was my 1st time trying/riding a cable car and it was just an alright experience for me. I thought the ride would have been a little slower to give you time to take in all the scenic views but I guess I was wrong since this went very quickly. I was a bit disappointed because of that but staff here are really helpful so service is good.
,,Best way to get to and from Sentosa Island,5.0,,Catch a taxi or bus to Mt Faber and then enjoy the ride across to Sentosa Island. Views are breathtaking and if your lucky you will get a cable car to yourselves.
,,Bird's eye view,4.0,,"An interesting way to go to Sentosa Island from MFLG Harbour Front 1. A very nice panoramic view on the harbour, Sentosa and the town. A round trip to Santosa for an adult costs 29.00 S$. They suggest several packages but it's not worth it."
,,Cable car,5.0,,Going by cable car to sentosa gives the best view of the island. Sometimes one can view the cruise liners docked there It also provides the best place to take pictures from above of the island.
,,Good way to get to Sentosa Island!,4.0,,"I took the cable car from Mount Faber to Sentosa Island and it was an excellent way to start the fun of Sentosa - highly recommend it, just try not to get caught in the long queues! :)"
,,Up in the sky,5.0,,Another amazing ride. though i had a ride earlier in the cable car but this was or a longer duration and was much height. It took us to santosa Island where we had a very good day.
,,Wonderful way to travel to Sentosa,4.0,,"A great way to go to Sentosa Island. It's a scenic joyride and you'll enjoy a bird's eye view of Singpore and Sentosa Island. We started on the HarbourFront tower going to Mt. Faber then travelled to Sentosa Island. Best if you take the first trip in the morning and then return from Sentosa to HarbourFront tower in the evening / sunset. The price is a bit steep (S$29) which is it's only downside. Admission to Sentosa Island, Mt. Faber, Cable Car Museum is included in the ticket. Thanks to Cebu Pacific we got 10% discount just by showing our boarding pass."
,,Don't Rock The Car,3.0,,"We used the cable car as access to Sentosa Island, and for that it is a good option, but as a stand alone attraction, I am not too sure. At S$29.00 per adult, it's not exactly cheap for what amounts to about a 15 minute ride. We did get a 10% discount for mentioning that we flew with Jetstar though. Just show your boarding pass. Boarding as we did at Harbour Front, we first travelled up to Mount Faber, where we had only enough time to take in the views from the lookout (go through the gift shop), before re-embarking on our trip across to Sentosa Island. At the Sentosa Island juncture, you can opt to look through the cable car museum which is included in your ticket price. We didn't this time, but did several years ago. It was a worthy attraction, but not a must see. The round trip later saw us delivered safely but otherwise unenthused back at Harbour Front. Take note that the car are not air conditioned, with only a small fan trying mostly unsuccessfully to circulate a little bit of air within the cabin."
,,Great views,4.0,,"The Cable Car ride is worth the price, giving the opportunity to travel across to Sentosa in the most scenic of ways. Also worth completing the round trip and grabbing a drink at the summit on the mainland."
,,exciting,5.0,,We used the cable car in singapore to travel over to Sentosa island. This was wonderful seeing the sites over the river. On our return journey it was dark and even better. Everyone should try it.
,,Disappointed that we could not pay for a one way trip,3.0,,"We travelled on the cable car in the evening to see a show. On buying a ticket we asked to pay for a one way ticket as the show didnt finished until after the cable car closed for the evening so how on earth are we supposed to complete our rerurn travel on there. Come on Guys surely there should be one way price if you are not open after a show being held (wings of time show 8.40 - 9.40) last cable car 9.30.

Other than that the ride was really nice and would have loved to use the other half of our ticket to visit Sentosa on another day (That would have meant travelling there twice maybe buying lunch and drinks and putting more money into their economy, shortsighted on their behalf ! )"
,,A truly thrilling ride,4.0,,"Ride: make sure you go all the way to Faber mountain and then all the way to sentosa. The ride is longer and nicer.

My kids loved the ride. They could not get over the vast stretch of water, the harbour front and the approaching merl ion.

Service: the person on the ticketing counter was very courteous. He asked us about the airline we flew to singapore on. Then he gave us 10% off, loved the surprised discount. The superheroes masks were quite a hit."
,,What a way to see it,5.0,,"The Singapore Cable car is a great way to go to Santosa Island, it only costs $29 Singapore Dollars, for a single or return(same price 1 way or return."
,,Magnificent View,5.0,,Fantastic way to travel to and from Sentosa Island. Gives you another look at Singapore from a different angle.
,,Wow - amazing views,4.0,,"Incredible views over Singapore harbour. This was a cool thing to do. Pros: we didn't have to line up for long, stunning views and a relaxing ride in a car to ourselves. Cons: quite pricey for what it is, the cars are not air conditioned (but that was OK). And the crazy comic decor slightly ruined some of my photos but again, what you gonna do?"
,,Thrilling,5.0,,Highly recommended. Thrilling experience. When we visited climate was favouring us. Diversified singapore. U can see all the way up to penisula of Singapore. Silently moves n amazed to be there. Worth the experience.
,,Nice...but..,3.0,,"Nice with the view and everything, but way too pricey. And no one-way option; so the ticket include roundtrip."
,,Awesome view from Cable car,4.0,,Cable car ride is very smooth. You can put your wheelchair (if you have old or handicap person with you) inside the cable car. We enjoyed the ride.
,,awesome view but expensive,5.0,,"The cable car is nice, wonderful view of harbor, santosa island, building, park, forest etc but a bit expensive."
,,nice.. have been to better car cables,3.0,,nice way to go from A to B.. the view is not something that is a ''must''.. use this to look at sentosa from above . i would skip it and try for something else to spend my money
,,Great way to get to Sentosa,5.0,,We took the cable car from Mt Faber to Sentosa after seeing some reviews on here. Great way to see Sentosa and surrounds and gave our young kids (1 & 3) a break from being confined to a taxi. Staff were helpful and we had no issues taking our stroller on board. All up it took around 15mins to get to Sentosa. We only travelled one way as hubby isn't great with heights so can't comment on the return trip but the kids and I enjoyed it.
,,Beautiful views,4.0,,"Lovely views of Sentosa Island and the lush greenery of Mount Faber.

It's a must do at least once but the price (S$29 for an adult for a 15 minute journey) puts me off doing it again. I used it as transport from the Island back to the mainland as opposed to just doing it for the sake of it."
,,good view of harbour,4.0,,"The cable car provided good view of harbour while travelling from Mt Faber to Sentosa island. We could see dolphins, accelelator from universal studioes and hotels during ride."
,,Great view,4.0,,"A good 15 minute ride from one end to the other. There are stops along the way. The ride may not be for those afraid of heights. The view is very nice, riding across the island, across some jungles, a highway, office buildings, etc."
,,Singapore,4.0,,Magnificent aerial view of sea and santosa island as you fly over from jungle to sea and then over buildings. One must enjoy the ride at least once.
,,Cable car ++,4.0,,"Its some 20 years since my wife and I last rode the Singapore cable car between Mt Faber and Sentosa. It was time to do it again and see if anything had changed - what could change on a cable car ride??

Price and fee structure was the first change we noticed. No longer could you by a one way ticket. It had to be a return ticket. The old fun of going one way and returning another way had gone. The price had also shot up as well, but I guess that's the way of the world now. Another option was 'to fly with the super heroes'. Yep, not only had the got a whole new generation of cars decorated with super hero themes but you could pay more (of course) and have images of super heroes flying by appear on the windows. of the cars as you traveled. You can even ride in VIP cars or dining cars.

Being old codgers (folk) we decided to be satisfied with just the views. They were great as was expected and boy has the island it self changed. You realise just how much when you see it from the air. Next surprise was a series of cable car and chair lift routes criss cross the island.

All in all, it's a great way to travel and you see so much"
,,Great views,5.0,,A great day at Sentosa & one of the top attractions is the cable car. Hint if you buy a day ticket $75 catch a taxi to Sentosa and then go on cable car return trip or you will have to pay $40 to catch cable car to island.
,,Awesome views.,5.0,,Cable car ride is very smooth.you can see the whole harbour.resorts world.Singapore skyline etc.we got great pics from the ride.
,,A must ride in Singapore,5.0,,An awesome way to see Singapore either in the night or in the day. The ride duration is perfect and you can see other attractions nearby once you are done with the ride. The staffs were efficient and professionals. the ride felt very safe and night view felt like a sci-fi movie.
,,"Oh, so this is how acrophobia feels, great view though",4.0,,"On our first day at Resorts World Sentosa, my wife and I decided to take our 2 boys (age 6 and 10) on the cable car ride to give them a good view of Singapore. We took a round trip ticket which was part of one of those ticket bundles they had ( they had a choose 5 of the 18 attractions with free Merlion access promotion). The cable car ride is located at the Imbia station, just one 1-2 minute train ride from waterfront station in Sentosa. Once you get down at Imbia, you need to take 4 escalator rides up to Imbia looke out (where the Madame Tussaud's attraction is also located). You will find the cable car station near the Starbucks there. You have to go through the cable car souvenir shop in able to get to the cable car ride. The cable cars came with different designs of DC super heroes which made my boys to even more excited to ride. Too bad we wound up on one of the VIP ones (they really wanted the Superman car). The cable car ride in itself was smooth and gave a great view of Sentosa and the surrounding area. We were also able to get a sneak peak of Adventure Cove Water park (which were going to in a couple of days), the harbor, and Vivo mall. What surprised me was that the ride was a bit long. You actually passed through two buildings before turning around. The attendant at the first building we passed through opened the windows of the cable car for us, which was good as ventilation was a bit of an issue. Most of all, I didn't expect the ride to be so high, in my opinion, higher than those in HK and Japan. With the windows open, and a soft breeze coming through the cabin, you really felt high up. My boys loved it. My inner ear, not so much. =D"
,,Great Views,4.0,,"You need a head for heights to fully enjoy great views of the city skyline, the harbour and Sentosa. We had the option (but did not opt for) to pay extra for a VIP cabin, which is encrusted with Swarovski crystals and has a crystal paneled glass floor!!! For S$29, in addition to the cable car ride, you get admission into Sentosa, the Museum, Mount Faber Park and Faber Peak (where you can stop for lunch). Am not keen on heights but glad I did it for the fabulous views."
,,Splendid aerial view,4.0,,"Amazing view of the harbor. Splendid aerial view of adventure cove park.
This is the only cable car which travels over mountains, roads, Sea and through the building.
We took a round trip. We boarded at harbor front then went to mount Faber. Spent some time there. Then went to Sentosa and in the evening returned from Sentosa to harbor front. It is not necessary to complete your round trip in one go. Alighting at harbour front makes it convenient to reach main Land from MRT. Not much waiting at mount Faber but from Sentosa to back you have to wait for 10-15 min
Fly with your super hero was something exciting for kids. You scan the code and get the chance to take photos with super heroes.
Only thing is poor ventilation in cable car. It was very hot. Good photo opportunity from the cable car."
,,Beautiful view from here !,4.0,,"Clean cable car but it's hot here. No air condition , only small window on it. I think max only for 3 person in one cable car. The view is very nice from here. You can see the sea with many cruise and other activity on the sea. You also can see the island from top."
,,Nice Scenery,4.0,,"We were riding our Superheroes cable car starting at Harbour Two tower, located at level 15.

Niew view and scenery from cabke car. We can see mother nature scenery and modern concreate building.

After we spent almost 3 hours inside Sentosa Island, we went back to the mainland and saw beautiful sunset.

Straight to Faber mountain, we love the view and scenery. Totally different from other places."
,,Air Today! The 7 Sees!,5.0,,"Wonderful arial way to see the city. Nice long tour between 3 tours, with get on, get off opportunity. See the Island with its amusements, visit the park, and fly inside a skyscraper. EZ to make this a full day experience"
,,Fun with super heroes!,5.0,,"We had the unlimited cable car ride so we get to snap photos with all the superheroes by scanning the code. It's really cool! The view is amazing! Since we visite on a Monday, we have the luxury of having the car by ourselves! :)"
,,Good view !,4.0,,Its fun for the kids. Elders would love the top view from the cars. A bit steeply priced by itself but a combo ticket works great because they let you take unlimited rides on the cable cars. Check out faber combo at the ticketing counters . Whats more enjoy the complimentary icecream that comes with the combo tickets while taking in the great view and enjoying the top of the world feeling!!
,,Good experience,4.0,,"Near to Harbour front MRT station. Breathtaking views from cable car. This is the only cable car which passes through a building, over sea & over the highways.
You can download software to have all wizards (batman, superman..) seating in you lap in the cable car."
,,Unexpected fun,4.0,,Glad we had time to jump on the cable cars! I didn't expect to have as much fun as we did! Great views of Sentosa and Singapore some great photo opportunities. No air con but plenty of ventilation. All the cars were DC themed and there was some great merchandise at either end!
,,Cable car,4.0,,It was a lovely experience to move in the air above the entire city and get the panoramic view. Clicked lot of pics on board and saw wonderful places from the top
,,Thrilling and smooth ride,5.0,,We boarded the cable car from my Faber.the ride is extremely smooth and picteresque.you can see vivocity mall.the port.in short the entire harbor and the whole of sentosa is visible.a not to be missed ride.
,,Very nice indeed,4.0,,"Thoroughly enjoyed the views and the trip on the cable car, although I thought it was a bit costly for what you got and a bit commercialised at each end. Good day out though."
,,Scenic views,5.0,,What a scenic way to get into sentosa a fantastic way to see how big and where everything is positioned great photos from the cable car cafe and gift shop available at mount Faber at the drop of point from our tour guide.
,,Mt Faber - rip-off,3.0,,"We were staying on Sentosa & took the cable car to Mt Faber & back. It was a clear day & the views were lovely.
I was expecting more at Mt Faber. When you arrive you can either go to the gift shop. or visit the cafe.
I had not checked, but thought there would at least be a park or gardens. So we had a coffee & headed back to Sentosa somewhat disappointed."
,,Very scary!,4.0,,"It is sure a nice and great experience, but I am very afraid of hights, so for me it was very scary! Jeez, I prayed to God the whole way to Sentosa! :)"
,,awesome view,4.0,,Great way to get to Sentosa. The view is fantastic and you get to see a bit of what's in store when you get there.
,,Nice ride to Sentosa Island,4.0,,My family and I loved going to Sentosa Island on the cable ride. The views along the way were enjoyable and breathtaking.
,,A must for everyone visiting singapore,4.0,,"In the Sentosa Island and a must for all people visiting singapore.
Go from Sentosa Island to Mt. Faber via Harbour Front Tower.
See around Mt. Faber and return back to Sentosa Island.
Views are breath taking and a visit to cherish
we enjoyed the ride"
,,Singapore cable car,5.0,,Brilliant views in comfortable and spacious cars. Thought more could be done at the Mt Faber end point - no dining options on the deck to soak up the surrounding scenery whilst chomping into an icecream.
,,Nice ride,4.0,,It's nice chilling enjoyable.the other perspective of Santosa. U can also make it romantic too.just imagine we two in air all alone for 15 min
,,Pleasant enough experience with good views of Sentosa Island :) Read my views for some useful tips.,4.0,,"This is a pretty pleasant experience to have, and although I wouldn't recommend it as a MUST DO, if you can squeeze it into you itinerary, its still worth it :)

Important Tips:
1. Start from the top! Get a taxi to drive you to the top and start from there. Buttttt don't go all the way to the top again, get off on the SECOND LAST stop before the top, because it connects to a mall and its FAR easier to get a taxi from there. Apparently its super hard to get a taxi if you return all the way to the top where you started.

2. Make sure everybody visits the toilet before you go into the cable car, ESPECIALLY if you have kids.

3. If you have a large travelling party like we did (3 adults, 3 children) its IMPERATIVE that everybody is standing close together and standing in a group BEFORE you jump in. The cable cars DONT stop. You basically just jump in, but if it moves to fast other members of your party can miss out on getting in. This is what happened the first time we tried to board. My husband ended up in another car because he was still busy trying to fold up the pram. Get all that stuff ready so u can just jump in together. Lucky at the next stop, we got out, and joined our hubby in the cable car he was in.

4. You can bring snacks and drinks on the cable car, and there's a little shop at the top where u can buy potato chips and water bottles if you want.

5. It's ideal to have an idea of what the weather forecast is that day BEFORE you get there. The day was cloudy but not rainy. Ideally don't go if its expected showers coz you wont get a good view of the scenery.

6. I wont kid you - the views are highhhhhh! But its worth the view :)"
,,Cable Car hover,5.0,,We had an excellent time on the Cable Car and could have 360 degree views of Singapore which was brilliant. We got off at the top of Faber Peak and took some wonderful panoramic photos and read some of the bells that were tied to the railings. We went when the sun was setting and the view was spectacular.
,,Cable car ride,5.0,,"From main land to Sentosa with panoramic view of whole of singapore and beyond even upto the small islands of Indonesia, the trip is a photographer's delight. Change the camera lens to the long zoom one for more exciting pics."
,,not for anyone anxious about heights,5.0,,Make sure you get a taxi to the top of Mt. Faber to catch the cable car. There is a halfway station before you fly over the water to Sentosa Island but it costs the same. Plenty to see and do on the island. Use the free busses to get around and definately plan your day before you go!
,,Good views,5.0,,"Good views, the kids enjoyed the masks given free with the tickets, I will recommended for the views and as transport to Sentosa island"
,,Best way to get to Sentosa,4.0,,Catch the MRT to Harbourfront station then get on the cable car up to the top at Mt Faber. You can get off and from there you get a fantastic view back to the city and over the harbour. Then get back on the cable car over to Sentosa. The round trip price will get you back to Harbourfront station.
,,Great Attraction,5.0,,We boarded the cable car from Faber Mountain and got off at Sentosa Island. An absolute must see!! Totally enjoyed the ride and Sentosa Island was a beautiful attraction place to visit.
,,Great way to see Singapore and get to Sentosa!,5.0,,"Very scenic and worthwhile ride. You can get off at Vivo City Mall for great dining and shopping as well. Don't get off at Faber mountain late as it's hard to get taxis from there. Dining is also available on the cable cars. Take the night ride as it's spectacular, as you see plenty of the Singapore from other view points during the day!"
,,Avoid it,2.0,,It was a short and overpriced ride to go to Sentosa. One gets a much better view of Singapore from the Singapore Flyer and it costs the same. Save your money for the flyer and take the monorail express to go to Sentosa
,,Highly Recommended to get to Sentosa,5.0,,"There is no better way to get to Sentosa than Cable Car! It is around 10 min. maybe less ride with amazing view of Singapore, Sentosa Island and Port. well worth trying it. You will get there easy by taxi and will arrive in Sentosa in best place to go around."
,,Scary but awesome,4.0,,Ok so when I say scary I'm pretty sure it us only for me and not the general population! When I wasn't scared (scared of heights) I was truly in awe
,,Amazing ride,5.0,,Staff very friendly who help you on and off the cable cars. The view that you experience as you glide across the sky is breath taking and the ride is so smooth
,,"Good ride, great views",4.0,,"I went on this with our 3 year old, who loved it as much as I did. Great views over the island, and thankfully we were able to get off at one of the buildings for a quick toilet visit -- but 12 floors down! Still, better than the alternative... :-)"
,,Different way to get into Sentosa,4.0,,"You will usually ride the Sentosa express going into Sentosa but if you want a different feel , you can take this cable car ride instead. From Vivocity you'll see signs to lead you there so it's pretty easy. They have this cable car theme too that you can enjoy."
,,A must do,4.0,,After a long day strolling around Sentosa this was a great way to finish the day. Air conditioned comfort looking out over the island of Sentosa and the port area of Singapore. Very picturesque and lots of photos. Worth the extra dollars to do.
,,Great way to get to Sentosa,4.0,,"We really enjoyed the scenery as we took the cable car into Sentosa. During our visit, there were DC themed cars which provided an interactive experience via an app on your smartphone. Although we didn't use this feature, we did have a photo with Batman and Superman on arrival!"
,,joyride thru cablecars,5.0,,Theres nothing to compare as you ride in . See the nice places in Singapore via cable car.Places where you dont want to ever wink cauae you might miss a thing to see.
,,One time visit,5.0,,"It is a great way to reach Sentosa - but it is strictly a one-time visit. It takes a long time to get to Harbourfront by MRT and then take the cable car And while at it, make the most and make sure you visit Faber Peak as well."
,,Great views,4.0,,Wonderful views a definite place to visit. Good fun take the family. Friendly staff it's a good way to enter Sentosa!
,,Not worth it,3.0,,Overpriced and doesn't add to the Sentosa experience. Try coming in via MRT/Sentosa Express or the Boardwalk. Save your money for attractions on Sentosa
,,Great Museum homage to the Cable Cars,5.0,,"Firstly experience the cable car from Vivo city or Mount Faber.

Then visit the Cable car Museum on Sentosa. It has all replica's of every edition of the cable cars used 70's, 80's, 90's and current plus control boards, pictures etc.

Third purchase the hoistory of the cable cars (book from $10) in the gift shop or at the museum."
,,You must try it once for the views and experience,5.0,,"Love the Cable Car and you have to experience it at least once. Note it is not cheap at $29 SGD and about $18 for children. Catch in the building next to Vivo city, follow the signs. If you take the trip there you get the return trip as well so more economical than 1 way. Safe, great views over the harbour, straight over adventure cove theme water park.

Currently have a superhero theme in some cabins and they give you a mask to of one of the heros like batman

If you have a pram or stroller will need to fold up to fit it in. Cable cars seat about 6 people and usually not that busy so you have it to yourself. Also smile for the standard professional picture on getting in and optional purchase at the station on Sentosa.

Gets off near Imbiah station. Trip takes about 10 mins

Great gift shop (possibly the best on Sentosa) and also the cable car museum is well worth a look and often missed by people. You can purchase replica cable cars plus a history book on the story of the cable cars $10-15) depending on soft or hard cover."
,,Excellent views in comfort,5.0,,It was a little on the expensive side but you get really fantastic views and it is nice quiet relaxing trip.
,,Nice View!,5.0,,Night view is amazing and perhaps for 1 time it is must do.. Good experience and wonderful scenes to capture!
,,Take the cable car,5.0,,"After our day at Universal we took the cable car back to the mainland before going on to our hotel. It,s really high so not for the faint hearted."
,,Cable car,4.0,,As afraid of heights as I am this trip is so worth it .it goes just long enough to take in all the sights and get photos
,,cable car ride benalmedena,4.0,,Take a ride on this for the most stunning views ever not dear good value and fun try it ! Very easy going a bird sanctuary and free show at the top of the mounting give it a go
,,cable car,4.0,,this was good harbour front station well signposted found it $29 and three stops. nice view over the harbour. and of the surounding harbour complex.
,,Must experience once in a lifetime,4.0,,"During my 9 years stay in Singapore, I have visited this place less than 5 times.
Short trip from end to end with decent view if not considered as so-so.
But I think it is worth to do it at least once when you are in Singapore.
There's a nice restaurant at the Mount Faber end that has pricey food but not disappointing taste.
Or you can take private cable car and dine in inside.
Best visited during the night."
,,Good View,4.0,,"Buy a sentosa packet to take the ride on Cable car, it is more worth it, save the money.

Plan the journey from Mount Faber to sentosa island during day time, and return from sentosa to main station at nigh time, to enjoy both day & night view.

Need not to worry about waiting too long, as it got many space and less waiting time.
The view is great, the kids will enjoy too. Suggest one camera take photo, one camera take the video record, as seldom we will use cable car as transport mode."
,,Nice and easy,4.0,,"If you are going to visit Sentosa Island, then do the cable ride to or from it.
The view is incredible and the cost is not that bad.
It is nice to see Singapore from that high.
And the people really helpful and with a smile!
Don't miss it.
P.S if you go with kids, they give some nice masks of batman and other superheroes before the ride for free. They will like it!"
,,Must do.,5.0,,"The Singapore cable car is a great way to see views of Singapore, which has an amazing skyline.
There are three stops, Sentosa, Vivo City and Mount Faber.
Try taking a walk around Sentosa and take in the attractions there (of which there are many).
Then take it all the way to Mount Faber, where you can enjoy stunning views over a cup of tea or something stronger, then take the cable car back to the half way point that is Vivo City and Harbourfront.
It's a fun way to see Singapore at height whilst being transported to other very attractive places."
,,Cable car best experience @ sentosa,5.0,,"do not miss the experience of travelling in the cable car, one can see the whole sea view while travelling cable car. Thanks to Singapore government for making such a fantastic, safe ride options hats-off to the staff and Sentosa team"
,,Great view,4.0,,Fun and a great view of Sentosa and the city. Worth the money and a great way to get to Sentosa island.
,,Birds Eye View,5.0,,"What an amazing view - cable cars run all day into the night. Efficient, wonderful way to get around, and would highly recommend that this is done on day 1 of your trip to help you get orientated."
,,Expensive but worth it,4.0,,Nice view of Resort World from the cable car. It allows hop off at the other end of the station. Can get pretty stuffy inside the cable car especially during noon when the weather is super hot. Obviously not for people who has fear of heights.
,,Wonderful,5.0,,I love this cable car tour as it was amazing. Mount Faber is amazing with panoramic view . You can also hop in and out to harbourcourts and Vivo city shopping mall and also Santosa island. The view of the city from cable car is amazing .
,,Great photos,5.0,,"Scary, fun and lots of laughs with other travellers. I also took some wonderful photographs. One of my hobbies is photography and I have some fantastic views of the island which I will enlarge to hang in my home. I can highly recommend this experience for all."
,,Why on earth would you want to miss the cable car trip ?,5.0,,"The tour to Santosa Island..by cable car..is a must. not a maybe..a definitive must. The view of Singapore quite grand. It etches in your memory..like the Hong Kong 360. You have not seen Singapore, if you have not taken the Cable car..at sunset.. wow."
,,Amazing views,5.0,,"I took the cable car to Sentosa world resort, I had the chance to enjoy beautiful views of the resort, cruise ships, and the harbour, it has easy access directly from the MTR subway system, and lands in front of the free buses stop for trips inside Sentosa island, I went to universal studios.."
,,Vantage point for sunset,4.0,,"Enjoyed our Valentine's day dinner this cable car (3 rounds) - 3 course meal with choice of coffee or tea, good food with vegetarian selection available.. do take the evening tram & ending with a nice glass of wine at jewel box....sunset was amazing.... Awfully romatic!"
,,"Great views, relaxing!",4.0,,"Cable cars were great. We did this as part of the two day play pass we bought. Not for the faint hearted, you're very high up. Takes you over the river and towards the centre and back again to Sentosa. Relaxing and a 15 minutes to chill. Maybe even grab a takeaway lunch and eat it whilst taking in the views."
,,Sentosa,2.0,,We took the cable cars with a return ticket but got told when we arrived it was only one way ...overall Sentosa I think is overrated .. kids would probably like it but you would need very deep pockets. map was useless & the signs were worse .. Need to do your research before you go ... Where the cable cars arrive is in the middle of nowhere .. & it's no fun if you are lost & no one who works there has any idea where anything is ....not a fan !
,,Stunning views,4.0,,"We caught the cable car from Faber Peak to avoid the queues. I don't know if its just me but the Superman theme stuff doesn't do it - maybe I am too old. The views over the bay and city are fabulous, you also get a great aerial aspect of the theme park as you arrive in Sentosa."
,,Great views,4.0,,"We took a ride at dusk, views were great and the changing skyline was beautiful. We could get off at 3 locations for a look around. The staff were helpful and getting on and off was easy,"
,,A pleasent way to get to Sentosa,2.0,,"Expensive, but pleasant enough. We used it to get across to Sentosa in style. Was not very busy at all.

Staff could have been friendlier and more helpful though - they sent us down to the ground floor, to come back up again to go to the top of the mountain - a total waste of 15 minutes."
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,"We went over to Sentosa during the daytime and went back to Singapore at night, so we had the best of views at both times. Stunning and relaxing way to get to Sentosa."
,,We had the best dinner,5.0,,"We had the best dinner on the cable car, was beautiful. Made better when my partner proposed. Perfect spot"
,,See it all from the air.,5.0,,"Ok, if I'm candid, I must admit I'm afraid of heights. That said, there is a thrill in overcoming that fear and enjoying the exhilaration of seeing the beauty of the North side of Singapore and Sentosa island from the air. The cars are comfortable and afford a 360 degree view of the north harbor, the gigantic freight terminals and ports and a good birds-eye view of Sentosa Island. I highly recommend this ride from the peak to the island during the day and during the week. It's likely you'll have a car to yourself and can enjoy the views and snap some pics along the way. Purchase a round trip ticket and have a blast.

And remember...keep on pedaling!"
,,Ripoff,2.0,,"Be very careful if you intend using the cable car and then visit Universal Sudios.
The ticket seller tried to sell us a combined cable car with admission to universal studios included for $101dollar. The cable car is $28 and day pass to Universal is $38.
I tried to report this to their management but no one seemed interested or surprised."
,,Best memory to buy in singapore,5.0,,"If there is one thing you should not miss this is it. The thrill is worth every penny. Please do get out at the mount Faber stop because you could not do so on your way back. We mounted at harbor tower and only found out we could not see mount faber when the car was already moving and I asked the assistant. For Filipino travelers, it is not true they give a10% discount if you present your cebu pacific boarding pass as claimed in the cebu pac website. The ticket lady in harbor was not privy to this."
,,best to do it at night :),4.0,,"If you visit Singapore,dont forget to try the cable car.from sentosa to mt.Faber. Either way is a goodway :) one of my fave things to do when I was living in Singapore. Especially during the night when all the lights in the area are turned on ,ooo it so magical..
One of the places to take your date for a romantic and fantastic night out.
.. I always found my rides her enjoyable and worth every penny of it."
,,experience is a good teacher,2.0,,"Our family has decided not to go back there again. We had different expectation about it. It was so boring. Far from excitement. We couldnt wait to get of from the see through tube.
May be it would be good for a romantic dinner or a forced business deal, that make you couldnt escape from the thing before you sign the contract."
,,iconic's ride of singapore skyride,5.0,,"many ways to go sentosa, but one way if you have to feel with sky ride, this is cable car.
the ticket can used to go singapore cable car museum, for first time why not to try "" world's 1st 7-star VIP Jewelled Cabin"" you get a glass of champaign, chekout the beauty of singapore cityline, and the evening i get the ""Sky dinning OnBoard"" on the cable car, you must buy back ticket for enjoy sky of mount faber park.

,,Sentossa,4.0,,Great view of Sentosa Remising the great day spent on the Water slide and lazing back on the tube as I floated down the river Watching the berthing of a Cruise Liner great general view on the island
,,Great views,5.0,,The journey from Sentosa to the mainland mountain was great and felt safe. The costs was $29 Singapore which included the return. There is a couple of great restaurants/café to eat and admire the views. Don't forget to ring the happiness bell.
,,This was one of the tours we booked,5.0,,"After booking a holiday of a life time to Singapore, had a look around the internet for help with local tours and came across a company called Isango. They had a lot of very nice tours that I was interested in, so I booked eight tours and paid for them before I went on holiday this allowed me to spread the cost before my holiday. All the trips where first class and the couriers did a very good job"
,,Cable car ride,4.0,,A short ride to Sentosa island. Comprehensive views entering Sentosa. The cable car museum at Sentosa was very informative and the historical friezes of Singapore were worth a look.
,,Cable car,5.0,,We did the superhero cable car ride across to Sentosa island.. Some really great views from here as you go over the top of huge cruise liners that are in the bay.. Good overview of some of the island. Fairly quick so those who don't like heights can still do it (like me) enjoyed it.
,,Worth the fee,4.0,,"This was a good way to get to Sentosa, beautiful views of Singapore and Sentosa. I think the fee was S$29 for a round-trip ticket"
,,Great views!,5.0,,We took the cable car across to Sentosa Island. It is not the cheapest way to travel but well worth it to take in the view that can't be accessed any other way.
,,Fantastic Views!!,5.0,,"We decided to book a return visit to Sentosa on the cable car! Best decision we made! Fighting a fear of heights myself, I got taken away by the views! The people were friendly, with no big queue to wait in to get on to a cable car! Highly recommended!!"
,,Conquered!!!,5.0,,An amazing experience!!! Am extremely scared of heights but nevertheless decided to attempt this. Glad that i did!!!!
,,Unique way of transport,4.0,,"You can travel to Sentosa Island via MRT but why do that when you can pay to take the cable car. There are two pick up locations, first Mt. Faber and second VivoCity Mall. The ride is about 15 minutes or so taking you across the Strait of Singapore. Really good views of Sentosa, the shipping harbor and Mt. Faber. Very cool experience."
,,Best views in Singapore,4.0,,"The view of the harbour is fantastic. I am terrified of heights but was so busy looking at the views, I forgot about the height. best to go early in the day before the crowds (families) start queuing up. Weird riding a cable car into a skyscraper. This is free if you are on a Singapore Airlines Stopover Holiday."
,,"Novel, yes; worth it, no",3.0,,"A cable car ride is a cable car ride. We went at dusk and a nice view, but it wasn’t worth the price. On the return, it was quite dark, and the other cable cars looked like flashing lightning bugs. The Super Hero theme wasn't of interest to the teenagers."
,,Enjoyable cable car ride,5.0,,"Thrilled. Deep green valley below and then ocean, boats, Sentosa Waterworld attractions ....
Our Grandchildren from NY always want to take a ride when visiting Singapore.
And, what? this time they distribute Masks - Wonder woman, Superman ....
Staff very helpful, smiling.
Car cabins are clean, airy and can view outside from all four sides."
,,Lovely day,4.0,,"It was not planned, but kids saw it and really wanted to ride. So We went to imbiah lookout and got 4 attractions package for very nice priced and u saved alot.
So from the 4 attractions we chose the cable car nice scenery went up the mountain and enjoyed lunch there they had nice gift shop with lovely helpful old lady at the cashier

Imbiah lookout is a great place to spend a day"
,,"sentosa cable car ride, singapore",4.0,,I took my nephew to the sentosa cable car ride. It was very nice view from the top even though it was scarry. Enjoyable and memorable
,,Sky seeing,4.0,,"It was a bit pricey but worth to ride it. We can see Singapore Botanical Garden from above, see Sentosa Island and the sea."
,,Great views and good fun,4.0,,"We really enjoyed our cable car ride. The views were fantastic and it was lots of fun for two adult women who screamed like children whilst inside the car, just because we could and no-one else was there to hear us. Sentosa was OK, but the restaurant at Mt Faber was a pleasant place to sit for the afternoon and check out the view whilst having a non-alcohol or alcohol beverage and something to eat. The views over Sentosa were good, so many pools."
,,spectacular ride,5.0,,"Offers great view from the top. Can be chossen for entry to sentosa. Starts from faber peak, halts at harbour station and then finally to sentosa."
,,Superb experience,5.0,,A Superb experience from Vivocity if you need to do it once and are visiting KL and Langkawi.. do it at Langkawi... its the best or at Genting... its most economical.
,,Super views - stunning,5.0,,"Lovely service, super views, a great way to see Singapore and reach the attractions on Sentosa. Really high and an extended ride well above the city- stunning. Would highly recommend."
,,Birds Eye View,4.0,,"Took the Cable Car from Mt Faber to Sentosa.
Was a clear day so fantastic views....a bit vertigo inducing if you don't like heights!!!
Great views of the Sentosa attractions as you come in over the island.
Great historical walk at top of Mt Faber...
Don't forget to ring the 'Happiness Bell' too...."
,,Worth the visit,4.0,,"If you visit Singapore, you should go to the Sentosa Island - and going there requires this teleferic. There are tour packages which combine unlimited teleferic rides and sightseeing in Sentosa."
,,Flying high,4.0,,An awesome way to see Singapore from about. Great over looking the harbor. Well worth doing if you visit Singapore.
,,Superhero Cable Cars,5.0,,We travel led with Superman and Batman. Novel idea and the kids absolutely loved it. Would definitely recommend for some fun.
,,"Excellent view,",5.0,,"Discounted tickets for Singapore residents, gentle and not frightening at all, you can snap great shots especially on a sunny day at sunset!"
,,Great Views,4.0,,"We made a point of taking the cable car to Sentosa Island because we had been told the views were amazing and they were. The ride is not long, 12-15 minutes but you have such a good view of the city and harbour and Sentosa island as you approach it. From a distance it doesn't look that high but when your car gets to the top of one of the towers you wouldn't want to suffder from vertigo.

A great way to get to Sentosa."
,,Has to be done,4.0,,"Must do if you are a visitor to Singapore, well worth it to see the views amazing.......maybe not do if you are scared of heights though, oh and before you go on at Faber then take a wee wonder up the hill to see the views of Singapore and Sentosa lovely"
,,SINGAPORE CABLE CAR,5.0,,Wow the trip to Sentosa island was thrilling in the cable car. Excellent recommend to everyone. Visit the museum and see how the prisoners survived in the prison camp
,,Birds eye view,5.0,,"A great way to see more of Singapore and Sentosa from above. The kids loved the DC comic theme. It's a hop in hop off cable car with 2 stops, for those who want to take some scenic photos at Mt Faber Park or do some shopping at Vivo shopping centre."
,,"Must do, spectacular views!",5.0,,"Reasonably priced. Smooth ride, great staff, spectacular views. Highly recommend doing the entire loop from Sentosa to Mt. Faber and back."
,,Nice view from the top!,4.0,,Went there a few years ago. The cable car ride was very expensive but the view from the top was spectacular. I could see Singapore and Sentosa Island so welfrom above. Price warning: 5 star. Enjoyable.
,,Fun with Superheroes,5.0,,"We had a blast on the cable car. The view was amazing, there was little to no line up to get on. The iphone app that you can download provided a lot of fun for us - trying to photograph superman and batman sitting next to us! Tip - make sure you get in a car that is marked with Superheroes as we didn't realise this the first time and got in a unmarked one which does nothing. We also didn't realise that you can get a ""licence"" for the cable car for nearly the same price as one return trip fee and this licence allows access for a whole year (much better value)."
,,I enjoyed this!,5.0,,So glad we caught the cable car to Sentosa Island! It was really beautiful and something different. It is worth the view :)
,,A Great Cable Car Experience,5.0,,This Cable went over to Sentosa Island (Universal Studios) with views showing the cruise ships in the harbour and up to the mountain which was amazing views back down to the city. Its a must
,,Short but worth the view,4.0,,"A few years back the original cable car ride from the mainland to Sentosa island was quite a long ride but with the reclaiming of land between the two shores, the ride seems to have become a lot shorter and the view not quite as spectacular as previously. Nevertheless it's still worth doing it just once"
,,great way to get to Sentosa Island,5.0,,"The cable car goes right over the cruise ships while in Port. I had just been on a cruise on the Superstar Virgo and the cable car went right over the top of the ship so I got some great photo's.
The naration on board was in both Asian and English so you can know what you are looking at . quick, comfortable and easy ride over to Sentosa to spend many hours of quality time. Don't forget to stay for the light show,amazing"
,,It was ok,3.0,,For me evrey one told us to ride it at the night ... i think in the morning will be better because the only thing u will see is the light of the buldings ..which is far away frome the cable car
,,Best way to reach sentosa Island,5.0,,"Singapore cable car is the best way to reach sentosa Island.
# Well maintained & clean
# Efficient service
# Affordable (U may combine the cable ride with other sentosa attraction _ Pls check at the ticket counter for ongoing offers)

Experience
It is a short ~10 mins ride with breathtaking views of singapore.You can enjoy the harbourfront area view.
Atop you can have a very good view of resort world.
Every time ,I visit sentosa - I always prefer to take cable car.

I will recommend this to anyone 100%,It is one of the best ride with memories to cherish"
,,Not overly excited,3.0,,I was a bit disappointed at the distance the cable car traveled. Once we reached one of the Stations we had no idea where to go or what to look at. I was looking forward to this experience but it has nothing on Skyrail in Cairns Australia
,,What a view,5.0,,"This was a great experience and the view at night was fantastic. You were givena beverage and chips with the ride and it was worth every dollar. It cost us around $28 each though the third person was $18 I think, night time is cheaper."
,,Choose the packages,5.0,,"The packages are really worth the money and much cheaper than standalone tickets.
I took the SEA Aquarium + Merlion + Cable car package for $75 which is cheap. Without the package it would have had costed around $100 ($34 sea aquarium + $12 Merlion + 2* $22 cable car one way + $4 beverage + $2 entry ticket). Went to faber mountain on returning. It was too late in the night so could just make out trees. There were people jogging in the night there. I could see the lit up city ."
,,Short but nice,4.0,,Short trip especially compared to Genting highland which we covered during the same vacation. More urban view and sea compared to greenery at Genting. Recommend. When you come back get done at the middle tower. You can do bit of a shopping and catch a taxi to your hotel
,,An artificial paradise!,4.0,,The Island is really an artificial paradise: Build up on a raised island with a beautiful tropical flora and located not far from the City Centre it is a great opportunity to relax an afternoon away from the hectical city life. Go there with the gondola to enjoy a beautiful view over the city. Tipp: Try to avoid the weekend as it will get very crowded then also with the Singapore inhabitants!
,,Another different perspective to singapore,3.0,,"While in Singapore for our mothers 70th birthday we went over to Sentosa and on the way back caught the cable car. The cable car gives a different view of Singapore but we were lucky to have a clear day. Its the sort of thing that there is no point doing if its pouring down or smoggy. Chairs are comfy and each car held up to 12 people. There was no que which was a added bonus.

It was another different perspective to Singapore. This attraction isn't very friendly if you are in a wheelchair or if you have mobility issues."
,,Good view,4.0,,"My family spent few minutes at Imbia lookout before we took the cable. The view from this point is beautiful. Green lushes up the hill and and the ocean on the other side. While on the cable car you can see the view of Sentosa and main Singapore island. My favorite part is when the head of the Merlion is appearing from the distance sorrounded by the green trees. I think it is worth paying the round trip ticket although we only used one way. I will definitely recommend using cable car if you go to Sentosa. I love it, my family love it and it's cheap."
,,Very nice cable car,5.0,,The first time you take the cable car the experience is very good. Good service and the views are just amazing. You can have a souvenir bought too.
,,best way to take picture great view,5.0,,"A ride for the whole family, although with pay, its relaxing and fun for sightseeing. Just hop in the cable car and bring out your camera, take picture everywhere"
,,Too pricey,3.0,,"Me and my husband rode the cable car from harbour front to sentosa, and back from sentosa to harbour front. It cost us 29 SGD per person just to ride the cable car for 10 minutes. The price is too expensive, but it's worth for once in a lifetime experience."
,,birds eye view,5.0,,"For a non fan of heights, im so glad I went on this ride, the views were absolutely out of this world, a must do"
,,Mind blowing views and experience.,5.0,,"A fantastic way to and from Sentosa. Views are breath taking being so high above the ground. This is Singapore so of course you can expect to pay for the experience......of course, not many of us have access to such an experience so it really is worth the cost so you can tick a box."
,,Day & Night views,5.0,,"Did the cable cars years ago, and wanted to do it again with the girls. Got a taxi to Imbiah Lookout and the cable cars to the island in the morning, spent the day at Universal Studios and took the cable car back that night. It was great to get both perspectives . Totally different skyline by night. Highly recommended for anyone going to Singapore...."
,,Great way to view singapore,5.0,,Loved it start at Mt Faber go down to sentosa then off at harbour city for dinner in harbour city or vivo next door then back on after dinner across to sentosa at night. It is same price one way as it is return but if u are taxi ing don't go back to mt Faber as hard to catch a cab up there
,,Through a building,3.0,,We took a taxi to the Jewel Box on Mt Faber Road. Mt Faber is 106m the highest hill on Singapore. We took a one way cable car ride to Sentosa from the mainland as an alternative to the train. I was amazed that the cablecar went right though a building. This attraction was free for us as we booked a Sinagpore Stopover Transfer package. We had a great view of half of Sentosa Island as well as a view across to the city. We went back to the mainland by the boardwalk to the mall.
,,Expensive trip just for a view,3.0,,"We enjoyed the views, but thought a round trip ticket for 30 SD was way too expensive. We didn't realize we could take the monorail but wish we would have after the experience. My advice, skip this expensive attraction, take the monorail to the island, and instead go to the top of a hotel to get the Singapore view (think Marina Bay Sands)."
,,Short but glad I done it...,3.0,,"We done the return cable car ride to Sentosa from the mainland as an alternative to the train, and was glad we done this. A bit expensive for such a short ride, but it did give a great view of half of Sentosa as well as a view across to the city- although most of the city was blocked by hills. Enjoyed it as a first time visitor to Singapore, but would not do it a 2nd time....."
,,DC heroes and cable cars,4.0,,"Interesting idea to pair the cable cars with DC comic heros like Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. We bought a package deal that allowed us to ride the cable cars all day while seeing multiple attractions on sentosa. The deal is good because you can save quite a bit of money."
,,Awesome view and a great to and fro ride,5.0,,"We took the Cable car from Sentosa till Jewel Box and back from there.

The view will be very good and the cable car is spacious and clean.

While on our way back it started raining and going in the cable car at that time was an amazing experience.

We took lots of photos and made a few videos as well.

Worth a ride once."
,,Nice view.,5.0,,"A bit expensive to opt for this mode of travel to get into Sentosa island of Fun.
Nice view from the top. Slow ride from Mount Faber to Sentosa.
Go in the day, when the weather is good. You can see a lot of happenings going on.
Go at night for a cool breeze (sometimes). It is not air-conditioned.
Better still, have a meal while you ride in the cable car. But you need to be rich or have a beautiful date so pretty, you will spend top dollar to be enclosed high up in the sky with her."
,,Another interesting mode of transport,4.0,,"Another great way to transport on or off Sentosa Island. It gave great views of Universal Studios, the Waterpark amongst others. It was a fun experience for the whole family."
,,great childish time!,5.0,,"I got on the cable car at Harbour front..& had forgotten about Mount Faber..the main station above..with the purpose of going to Sentosa Island....bought ticket for both...(Sea life centre & cable car)...anyway i was told that you could take as many rides you wanted so, i went round 4 times...over to the island & back...up to Mount Faber & just enjoyed the views...great fun!!!..the staff thought it quite funny & were very friendly! I'd certainly recommend! ."
,,Incredible views,5.0,,We took the cable car back from Sentosa after taking the train and monorail to get there. We only found out there are no one way tickets when we went to buy them so it was an expensive ride. The views were excellent over Sentosa and the bay. We took the ride all the way to the top of the hill and there were some great views to be had from there as well..
,,Great view,5.0,,We got to Sentosa with the cable car and come back to Singapore by train. Great view. Big line to buy tickets but a nice to do experience.
,,Nice view but nothing amazing,3.0,,Catching the cable car to Sentosa island was a fun way of getting to the island as you got a nice view of the island and all the attractions. We bought return tickets but in the end caught a cab from Sentosa back to the main land because it was just as fast if not quicker. I would recommend buying a one way ticket and then catching a cab back at the end of the day.
,,Overpriced and underwhelming,2.0,,"Don't bother with this attraction. Yes, the views of Sentosa are OK. But we just wanted to do a quick loop and not stop anywhere. 10 minutes and $150SGD (family of 5) later and it just left a disappointing taste in our mouths. Fellow travellers were also complaining about the exorbitant prices at the cafe at the top of the mountain. They also had this stupid & cheesy Superhero theme to the ride where they wanted to charge you more to participate! There are so many other wonderful things to see and do in Singapore. This is not one of them."
,,It's a cable car.,2.0,,"For some reason I took the cable car over to Sentosa. It is pricey and not interesting at all. If you have ever riden a cable car, there is absolutely no need to go on this one. The sights aren't great. They pack the cars full, so you get to ride with others.

On the positive side, the lines weren't as long as I feared. Not bad at all. But if you just want to se Sentosa, take the small train instead. This was not 29 well spent S$."
,,panoramic views of singapore harbor and sentosa,4.0,,the mount faber cable car ride of about 10mins is the best birds-eye view of sentosa island. we had good weather going both ways and got great views and photo ops. we passed directly over a large cruise ship as well. the container cranes (looking like giant prehistoric giraffes) were a nice backdrop. it's a bit steep in price (about Sing$100 for a family of 4) but the kids had a great time. from harborfront on the metro. entry price includes free buses on sentosa island and the Sing$3 admission price to sentosa.
,,Excellent,5.0,,This has got to be the best way to get over to Santosa Island. The view is amazing as you come down the hill and pass through the middle of a building. I was looking forward to doing this and wasn't disappointed.
,,Great experience and worth the price,4.0,,"My family and I enjoyed a trip on the jewel cable car in Singapore during our recent stay in Santosa. The views are great and really give you a perspective of Singapore. The views from the I bush lookout are also good. We ate at the resturant up on the mountain which wasn't much to write home about, still satisfactory."
,,Great views,5.0,,"This was so enjoyable. Unfortunately the weather was very wet on our trip to Sentosa, but the return was lovely and clean. On arrival at Sentosa, there is a choice of 3 free shuttle buses which take you to various parts of the island. The return trip for the cable car is $29 Singapore. Worth it for the views over the harbour and city."
,,"Great view, great way to arrive",5.0,,"We took the cable car across to Sentosa Island and back again (the return trip was included in our day pass). It is an easy process with limited queues and provides fantastic views of the island and city in all directions.

The Sentosa Express (monorail) is the most cost effective way to go to Sentosa, but this is the most stylish!"
,,Sentosa connection,4.0,,"This was a good day we travelled to Sentosa on the cable car which was enjoyable, shame its not air conditioned as it got a bit warm up there with no breeze getting in."
,,Great view and a fun experience,5.0,,"We really enjoyed the experience it was great to get a different perspective of Singapore, but it was very expensive."
,,Average,3.0,,"We felt that this was over priced for what it was. The views of Singapore were not great. Cars NOT air-conditioned, the fans weren't great."
,,Good fun and great view,5.0,,We loved this experience and got to see a lot of Singapore and especially Sentosa Island by doing this.
,,Don't expect to do a one way trip!,2.0,,"This cable car is clean, smooth and fast with beautiful views. However it is very expensive and you cannot buy a one way ticket. We went over by bus to Sentosa and thought we would take the cable car back. They wouldn't let us get a one way ticket so we paid $58SD for a 10 minute trip."
,,Just for fun,4.0,,"we took 1 way ride to sentosa thro' cable car. It is good enough for 6 people . You can just take it for an experience and easy access to the imbiah lookout. enroute we get to see the sentosa merlion, harbour front, the bird's eye view of resort world in the island. Apart from that,i would say it is pretty much like any other cable car except with a Great height :)"
,,High on the sky,4.0,,"If ever you visit Singapore,then this cable car ride is a must as the experience is superb as you are sitting high and having a spectacular view of Singapore bay.Take a cable car with a glass bottom as it will be more fun to have a view all around you.I would recommend this ride as who knows when you will again be going to Singapore,so jump in and enjoy!"
,,Cable car,5.0,,Fab experience going over to the city and back. Lovely way to see the island from the sky. Would live to do it again.
,,Be aware if you expect the super hero experience,2.0,,Great views but be careful if you expect the super hero experience where you can take pictures with Batman etc flying behind you. Not all the cars have the technology fitted and no-one tells you that when you get on. Our children were very disappointed when we realised that ours did not and we were refused a refund despite a lengthy discussion. For $94 SGD it was pretty poor customer service.
,,scary and expensive,3.0,,we did it as why not but its $30 to ride both ways on the one day and we didnt realise so we paid $30 each for a 10 minute ride
,,Bird's eye view of Singapore,5.0,,Great way to see Singapore. Clean cables and orderly queues. Able to meet people who visited the beautiful Singapore as well.
,,Frighttastic!,5.0,,Took the cable car ride from Sentosa island to jewel box station at the top of the town. The cars are small holding maybe 6 people. There were 4 of us and we had one to ourselves. The views were spectacular but if like me you are not too happy with heights be advised that the cars do sway a bit which scared me. Still a fantastic sight.
,,Fast and smooth ride,5.0,,Fast and smooth ride to and from Sentosa Island. No queues for the cable car ride itself. Enjoyed Singapore Sunset with my friends.
,,Great views of the ships,5.0,,We caught the cable car over to Sentosa and that is a treat in itself as you get some great views. Would reccomend although Sentosa island itself is like one big theme park and unless you have kids not that exciting although the Sea Aquarium is fantastic and I have reviewed seperately
,,Fantastic helicopter views of the Singapore waterfront,4.0,,"The Singapore cable car gives you great views of the Sentosa island, Harbourfront area, the surrounding water and a bit of the town too. You do not get views of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel - so do not go with that expectation.
The view of the Sentosa island is good - you get to see quite a bit of the resort world with few swimming pools, greenery and Sentosa attractions.
You can get off at the Mt. Faber and stroll a bit, or continue to return to your starting point.

You may also get a top view of the Star Virgo cruise if your timing is right - late afternoon on Wed and Sunday."
,,A bird's eye view of Singapore.,5.0,,"If you've never been on the Singapore Cable car, then take it. The trip offers you a stunning view of Singapore City. If you want to get fancy, for a lot more Singapore dollar, you could even dine on the cable car. I enjoyed my ride on the Singapore cable car, but I don't think I'd be willing to spend so much to do it again."
,,Enjoying Singapore from Another POV,5.0,,"We took the ride from Harbourfront station which took a while to find from the mall. There were helpful directional signs but with a 3-year old kid in tow even with all the adults with me, we missed some of it. I was with my parents, younger sister, younger brother, sister-in-law and nephew for this trip. We were able to enjoy really good discounts (around 15% or more i think) for the tickets thanks to the tourist card from the mall. We fit one car and it was mayhem as soon as it took off as all of us wanted to have photos. The view is amazing specially over Sentosa as we try to identify which is where. Food and drinks were offered but we did not avail these as we were busy enjoying the view and it was a bit pricey. We got off Sentosa to enjoy the attractions and got on the cable car again after to get to Mt. Faber. After more photos, we got on back again and got off at the Harbourfront Station. We got on at around mid afternoon and finished the ride towards sunset. This is the best time to go because we had an amazing view before, during and after sunset which made for more great photos. I've been to Singapore several times and this is the highlight of last year's trip there with my family."
,,Fantastic views,4.0,,We went from Sentosa to the mainland and back. The views across the harbour were breathtaking. The ride was very smooth although I wouldn't want to be on it if it was windy. The ride seemed to last a long time and it was good value for money. You could disembark and have something to eat and drink if you wished.
,,Excellent experience - breathtaking,5.0,,"It was great, we took the ride all the way from Santosa to the mountian, had dinner and returned with the last cable"
,,A head for heights,3.0,,All very efficient and quite reasonably priced but even though Inusually have no issues with heights it was rainy and windy and most definitely I was pleased to get off!!!
,,Very Enjoyable Ride,4.0,,"This is the second time I enjoyed this cable car. Last time being in 1990, when I was kid myself and rode this with my Dad. This time I was the Dad and my daughty was riding with me. Was kind a melancholy. Say the older cars that I rode last time at the mainland station.

Got the whole view of the island plus the mainland vicinity. Tickets are priced a bit steep but it will be worth it and the ques move on fast.

Try it, I bet u'll enjoy it..."
,,"Can't buy one way ticket, have to buy return ticket.",4.0,,"We spent the day on Sentosa doing the usual things and decided we would take the cable car back to Singapore. However, you can't only get a one way ticket, you have to pay for a return trip even if you only go one way. $29 for a 10 min ride. Lovely views and very smooth ride, but too expensive."
,,Cable cars,5.0,,Ride the enclosed cable cars to Sentosa Island! you must be at least 500 ft above the harbor!! fantastic view and worth the fee.
,,Beautiful - but brief and expensive,3.0,,"I guess if you're in Singapore and oblivious to all the money you're spending on vacation, add this one to the list. it's not that this cable car ride is bad - it's not, it's very good, as is everything somehow connected to Sentosa. The problem is that it's very expensive - about US$25 a head, and it only lasts about ten to 15 minutes. If you've been on cable car rides in other Asia locations, like Hong Kong, you'll get a better bang for buck, and see much, more more. I would not say this is a must see; that said, I imagine kids will find it fascinating, and if you've got money to burn, burn it on this, too."
,,A highlight of the trip,5.0,,"This is a great segue into or out (or both) of Sentosa. There is an amazing view, and great attractions (the Luge in Sentosa, the banquet hall and it's amazing bathroom in Mt Faber) on both sides."
,,Amazing views of Singapore,4.0,,We have boarded from Imbiah station back to Harbour front. It was a very good experience and definitely worth to try. My 12 years old son loved it because the cabins had Super hero themes.
,,Enjoyable,5.0,,Excellent views of the bay and the city. It takes roughly 20-30mins. If your lucky you can get your own cable car too. Nice and relaxing and great for photos. Would go it again. The pictures really do speak for themselves.
,,Nice view of the city,4.0,,"Although overpriced(for that matter nothing is cheap in Singapore, however, you get a discount if show your Singapore airlines boarding pass), it is a good ride and provides nice views of the Sentosa island. Just the right speed, very stable and not scary at all. My 4 year old daughter particularly enjoyed the ride."
,,Great for young kids,4.0,,Fantastic views from the cable car as you cross from Mt Faber via Harbourfront to Sentosa. Popular with young children and an interesting way to get to Sentosa.
,,Exhilirating experience with breathtaking view!,5.0,,"Not a scary ride at all! Each cable car is clean, comfortable and speed is just enough. Crosses over water, buildings, then up to a beautiful and classy restaurant at Mt. Faber. less than S$60 roundtrip fee. (visited March 2011)"
,,Fantastic views over Sentosa and Singapore,5.0,,"If you dont go on this iconic landmark ride then its a shame. It is (in my opinion) well over priced however the views are amazing, it gets you places and its very relaxing. Stranded hundreds of feet in the air it is a little exhilarating too. I can not remember if there is aircon installed but i don't think so. So not a place for rest-bite from the heat."
,,Just okay,3.0,,There is nothing special in this ride though they are claiming that they are the first cable car provider with Justice League design in their cable cars. From Harbor we went to Sentosa and the cable car that brought us to Sentosa has no any mark of Justice League. Quite funny.
,,Singapore scenery from the Cable Car,5.0,,It was worth every effort to experience the cable car journey and the scenery from the cable car which connects the sentosa islands.
,,very good experince,4.0,,"one of the must do activity and best for visiting sentosa island in singapore, and its worth when passing above the star cruise"
,,a stop over worth to try,3.0,,i'm afraid of heights but took the courage to try this... before finally going home..we decided to stay atleast 2 nights in singapore and this was the best advice everyone is telling me to try and make my trip memorable one hahahaha...i dont want to post pics since my nervousness is surely clear in all the shots...
,,Sky Dining at The Cable Car,4.0,,"We arrived at the Mount Faber cable car station at around 635pm. We were told be there between 6-7pm... 3 days ago when we made the booking. Minutes upon arrival at the boarding area, the staff asked if we wanted a sparkling wine or a mocktail, this is the 1st welcome drink and if we wanted coffee or tea with our dessert. then we were ushered to the cable car with our appetizer and welcome drink.

First rotation is 30minutes, starts from Mount Faber then to Harbour Front Station and then Sentosa and back to Harbour Front and Mount Faber, all these while we saw the sunset and a stunning view from the cable car. It's just the two of us, but let me tell you, it can be quite warm inside the cable car although there is a mini fan.

Total rotation is 3, which comes out to 90mins. 1st round, appetizer, 2nd round is main course, 3rd round is dessert. Please book at least 3days in advance on their website for the sky dining. There you'll be able to choose your main course or any other optional you might want to add at an extra cost.

Overall it was an enjoyable experience, food is great, staff was prompt in their service. There's a photographer who takes your picture and if you like it, they can print it out for you at $20, no obligation."
,,Another way of getting to Sentosa Island,4.0,,"Just another way of getting to Sentosa Island. Nice views, but you will spend some time walking/queueing/transferring to monorail."
,,An old attraction of Singapore!,3.0,,"Nothing really special about the cable car ride to and fro Sentosa island, It is just another option to reach Sentosa Island. You can enjoy the view and get to ride as much as you like if you buy travel package at Sentosa Island, which in my case brought me to Faber Mountain Cable car station which I found to be a small hilly nature wonder worth to explore if you love to be surround by trees and bushes.It's an old attraction that did not give me a thrills as other cable car in this part of the world."
,,Nice ride at night,4.0,,We took the cable car during late evening and had a lovely view over Singapore. You can choose the see through bottom car but we opted for the usual one. I was glad as wasn't keen on dangling in the air over the bay LOL.
,,Overrated,2.0,,Pretty boring. Doesn't get very high. Not much on either side of the cable car. If you are going to Sentosa might be the way to go. But Sentosa is not really worthwhile either.
,,Scenic way to get to Sentosa,5.0,,"Efficiently run service to get you over to Sentosa Island with the added benefit of good views over the harbour and sometimes cruise ships. Restaurants, gift shop and toilet facilities at the top of Mount Faber. In fact the door to the toilets says Peak a Loo, a hint to the views from inside."
,,Great views!,4.0,,"This ride offers great views over Singapore but sadly there's not a lot to see once you get to the top of Mount Faber. You can also get off at Harbourfront for Vivocity. You can break up a return journey, so we did one way in the daylight and another at night, which I'd strongly recommend as they're both great in different ways. No queues and we got a carriage to ourselves :)"
,,A Cable Car Experience..,4.0,,Its a nice experience.. Saves on your time & efforts. Its an easy ride & scenic too.. You might need to wait for approx 20-30 minutes as many of the groups also go from here..
,,Fantastic views,5.0,,We did the cable car right on dusk with some rain and lightning. Fantastic to see the night set in and the lights of Singapore start coming on. The cars are pretty comfortable and steady and the rain only added to the experience. Well worth it!
,,Worth doing,4.0,,"If you are travelling to Sentosa it is worth taking the cable car over there. Although it is a little expensive, it's a great way to see the island and view the harbour. I think it is worth paying the bit extra to travel over to the island by cable car - you get to leave from Mt Faber which gives you another view of singapore as well"
,,Like clockwork,4.0,,"As one has come to expect of Singapore, this facility works like clockwork. The feel is that of dependability, so it helps for those who, like me, are afraid of heights: there is no evidence of shortcuts in safety and engineering here. Go on a clear day, if you can, for the views are spectacular."
,,Best Cable Car (Bird View),5.0,,"It feels awesome when you go to sentosa island via cable car. as it so much located over the height & you get a stunning view of singapores harbor front with Sentosa island & the famous universal studio. Truly saying I enjoyed to the fullest over this cable car.
Best part even wheel chair access is given for old age peoples."
,,Great view!!!,4.0,,"A trip to Sentosa Island will not be complete without trying Singapore Cable Car. It is reasonably priced- $26 at that time back and forth . We enter through the Mt. Faber park to Harbourfront and back. Inside the cable car, we held our breath as we get to see the whole Sentosa Island, the bay and the harbor and the nearby buildings in it 360-degree clear glass-covered windows. I had superb shots. Highly recommended specially for first time visitors."
,,Do Not Miss It,5.0,,"Located on Mount Faber, this cable car takes you directly to Sentosa Island where Universal Studios and The SEA Aquarium is. Its an amazing was to see Sentosa Island from above, and its quiet fast. Beware it is very high, and is not for the feint hearted. Loved it !"
,,Worth the ride and the view,4.0,,"We chose Mount Faber as the starting point of a trip to the attractions of Sentosa. As with much else in Singapore, the cable car is administered like clockwork. The views are beautiful, both from the gondola and from the terminal and its surrounds. Restaurants here and a little walk away are accessible and adequate. Well worth the trip!"
,,Great Bird's Eye View,5.0,,"Cable car provides a great view of the city especially Sentosa island and the harbor front. Must see for all visitors to Singapore. From a tourist perspective, there are options to purchase tickets in combinations with attractions in Sentosa island which definitely saves some money and is a good option."
,,Newer car lacks bottom glass,3.0,,"I took this ride first in 2003. The cars at that time were small (could sit 4 persons) but they had a glass bottom. I think that was their USP. This time in May-2014 when I took the ride again, the car was specious (6-8 persons can sit) BUT the bottom glass was missing! It takes the fun out of the ride, to be frank! Anyways, the view below is very good.
My suggestion is that while going to Sentosa from main land, get-in at Tower 2 on HarbourFront. Then while returning from Sentosa go all the way till Faber Peak. Enjoy the walk there and then again get-in and finally alight at Tower 2.
Also, if you are planning two trips to Sentosa - one for Universal Studios and other for the other attractions on Sentosa like the Luge, Dolphin Lagoon etc. then have the Cable Car ride once and have the Sentosa Express on second day. Now, the EZLink card is accepted for Sentosa Express as well."
,,Great views of many Singapore attractions,5.0,,"Lovely way to travel high over Singapore from Sentosa to Mount Faber. We had just left our cruise ship, which we passed over the top of and got great photographs. We went to the bistro at the terminal and sat for a couple of hours with a bottle of wine and sadly watched our ship leave the harbour."
,,Breathtaking views over Singapore,5.0,,"The best way to get to Sentosa Island.
You will sit in one of the cars and simply enjoy the views over Singapore and harbor. Magnificent! Weather has to be fine of course, but it very often is in Singapore. So buy your ticket, step in, sit down, relax and enjoy..."
,,Nice,4.0,,This is a nice ride to and from sentosa to the city and to mount faber. Yes your ticket entitles you to a to and fro ride from mount faber to sentosa. The station next to vivo mall is in between the two. So if you wanna spend more time looking at the awesome landscape if singapore you can go to mount faber and then to sentosa. It's really nice and gives birds eye view if singapore and far beyond.
,,Great View,5.0,,"Great view of Sentosa and HabourFront. We have tried day and night trip, during night you can see beautiful city lights. One of the must try activities when it is your first time to Sentosa."
,,Buy a Package Deal and enjoy Sentosa,5.0,,This is a great ride that provides excellent views of the city as you ride over to Sentosa Island. We loved that you could hop on and off. The cars are pretty stable and don't swing around which is nice. It doesn't travel super quickly either. My kids LOVED it.
,,Great cable car ride from sentosa to mount faber,5.0,,we took the cable car from sentosa island to mount faber...we got off there..enjoyed the views and had a bite/drink in the restaurant up on the top...it was a great stop to relax and enjoy the views
,,Great experience,4.0,,"Awesome views. Take a round trip while visiting Sentosa. From Sentosa, if you wish to go to Universal, take the monorail which is a complimentary service. And dont forget your camera :)"
,,Beautiful sky view,4.0,,"Its one of the must try experience in singapore, its actually very convenient as well to go to sentosa by jewel car, you can get to get there without fuss plus you get this awesome experience. To be honest im afraid of heights but I thought its really high compare to the one in langkawi this one is still tolerable. Must try specially if your travelling with family or kids theyll surely love this. They even offer dining experience here with a personal butler."
,,Sentosa island,3.0,,Its a rather short trip if u only want to go to sentosa from harbourfront. But its has beautiful view n they over different kind of package trip by ticket booth.
,,Loved the ride,4.0,,"A round trip in the cable car provides terrific views of the island’s facilities, as well as Keppel Harbour on its way to Mt Faber. Well worth the ride, which gives a great bird’s eye view of the area and breaking the return journey at Mt Faber to enjoy some light refreshment is just as enjoyable.
A visit to the Cable Car Museum at the conclusion of the ride is well worth the effort - the museum contains a full record of the history of the cable car, with many photographs and newspaper articles illustrating its early years."
,,Enjoyable Mid Air Oddessy,5.0,,"Easy to get to, breath taking view of Sentosa and the harbour area. Quite a ride... not too short nor too long... The soveniur store has an awesome collection of preserved Singapore Orchids... worth a look and a good buy..."
,,Stunning view of Sentosa and Singapore Harbor from hundred meters above,4.0,,"Singapore Cable Car gives you a stunning view, you can see Sentosa Resort, Harbor, Indonesian islands from hundreds meters above, the sight is great for photography also and even you can see cable car museum. From Mount Faber to Sentosa, this cable car gives unforgettable memories."
,,Wow what a ride,5.0,,"The cable ride to Sentosa was amazing. The view from the cable ride is amazing, You get to view the harbor, the most expensive neighborhood and sentosa island."
,,view of city from sky,4.0,,"travel by cable car once in day and once in night time,excellent view of city,should try and take a sentosa day pass which includes a cable ride cos ride is expensive"
,,Ok but not spectacular,3.0,,After experiencing the cable car ride in Lantau Hong Kong this came off second best. We took the whole round trip getting off for a short time to check out Sentosa Island. Apart from some harbour views in the Sentosa section we mostly passed over construction sites so was not inspiring.
,,jewel of a ride,5.0,,"An airborne view of all the attractions of Sentosa Island and the port is definitely worth the price. If rain clouds swirl in, the fine mist makes the ride over the thick vegetation all the more magical. A must visit attraction on your Singapore trip, especially when you visit Sentosa island."
,,Great view,5.0,,Best way to get to santosa. We purchased the deal that also had access to the aquarium and unlimited rides as well as the merlion. This is a must do if you are going over to a Santosa. A short walk from the MRT.
,,A ride you enjoy,5.0,,Its mostly used to visit the sentosa Island. And its a better and beautiful way to visit the island. The scenic view is beyond words.
,,Romantic Sky Dinning in the Cable Car.,5.0,,"Having a relaxing fine dining 3 course meal is worth an once in a life time experience. You may view the busy expressway, RWS, sea animals like dolphins and the beautiful sunset while your dinner. For the price of $258+++ per couple on Saturday as it is booked by my husband to celebrate my birthday, is not only reasonable as the food is delicious.

There are welcome drink and serve with the choice of food you want from their online menu. As it is my birthday. They had also placed their efforts to get me additional birthday ice cream cake. A total 3 rounds - 1 round 1 course. Finale will be sitting on their VIP Cable Car that is a Sofa.

The staff are professional and handle things in a bliss. Highly recommend everyone to give it a try."
,,Great Aerial Views,3.0,,"It cost $26 Singapore Dollars to ride the Cable Car from the nearby Cruise Terminal to an island (Santosa) with hotels and attractions for children and adults at an added cost. I did not find anything on the island that was free. So if the attractions for an added cost or the view do not have value, skip this ride."
,,fun way to get to the island,5.0,,"if you're going to Sentosa often (more than once), there is a cheapest way to do so - by Sentosa express which is only 4 SG$ per person.
but i recommend to take the cable car, at least once. it's more expensive- yes, but you get a great view of the port, the island, the hotels & the ride itself is fun! we went to Sentosa during the day & went back to SG in the eve., when it was already dark & it looked like 2 diff. places.
recommended!"
,,Fun attraction,5.0,,"Lovely end to our day! The cable cars are really fun and relatively cheap. There are special deals for couples, so if you are in a group of 5, try and find another person for when you buy the ticket as it will be cheaper! We accessed the cars from Sentosa Island, the views across singapore were beautiful. A must do!"
,,I expected more,4.0,,"We took the cable car because we wanted to see the view. It is nice to see the view of Santosa island, you get to see the port too but not much of the Singapore river or buildings. Even though I expected a little more I think it is a very good way to get to and from the Island, the ticket buys you a round trip. A little expensive I would say"
,,Beautiful view and Great combo package....,5.0,,"Cable car ticket costs 26 SGD for a round trip and its worth every penny coz in one ticket you njoy alot of flavors... fantastic vies of harbour and city... ideal entry into Sentosa island, you see the resort world sentosa from above and its beautiful.... and you get to see the iconic Jewel box aswell which is a splendid place with awesome dining.... So surely recommended....
If you are in Singapore for vacation then you must have 2 days complete for sentosa island, go with sentosa express on one day and use the this marvel cable car the 2nd day... You will love it for sure...."
,,Nice aerial view of Sentoso - can get very stuffy in the cabin,4.0,,"The first segment out from Jewel Box wasn't too great as it is overlooking the office buildings and roads. When approaching Sentosa island, that's when you get an aerial view of the Beach villa and Marine Life Park, which differentiates the experience of entering Sentosa by car.

Starcruise happens to be preparing to leave that day hence managed to catch a glimpse of the activities happening at the open top floor of the cruise.

As the sun is setting when we are in the cabin, the air gets very stuffy in warm humid Singapore and we are all perspiring while inside the cabin."
,,Lovely trip to Sentosa Island,5.0,,"Me and my friend Claudia in a raining and windy day in Singapore, we didn't know what to do, as Im affraid of hights my friend convinced me to make this trip on the cable car lol. I wasn't very sure about it but I agreed, and we had an excelent day Sentosa Island it is the place to be! It was a sunday and the Island was lively and the sun came out and made it such a special day! Seriously amazing, and if you have time to go to the Universal Studios please do it for me and also please give spider men a big hug for me lol :-)"
,,It itself is charismatic at night...,5.0,,"To the cable car ride you may travel by MRT to Harbour front station and take exit B and follow sign and directions towards the cable car. It’s a long walk and up on level 5 of Vivo city Mall across to another building for cable car tickets and cable Car station.

Per adult the ticket price is SGD26 however if you purchase combos or attractions along with Cable Car it works out to be cheaper. You get great deals on combos.

It’s the best way to get to Sentosa and enjoy the aerial view of the harbour and cruises berth and passing by.
The last ride from island back to the city is at 2130hrs. These small Gondolas looks actually like a Jewel. The blinking lights at the edges of Gondolas gives an impressive effect. Looks like a trinket moving in the air."
,,great way to sentosa,5.0,,a nice lea surly ride over the harbor front and on to sentosa island where you can visit universal studios and a great aquarium all in the same day
,,Excellent views,5.0,,"Definetelly the best way to get over to the Sentosa island. The views are amazing. I was lucky to have a cruise ship approaching as well, beautiful picture opportunities all around."
,,its nice,5.0,,"you watch sentosa island frome there its nice and safe ,i am littele afraid from hights but i was injoing this"
,,Doors,4.0,,"Please make sure the doors of your cable car are closed before you leave the station, the doors on the one we were in didn't close automatically and I had to manually close them, it could be a problem if small children are in the car otherwise a pleasant experience"
,,Great way to get to Sentosa island!,5.0,,"We decided to go up to Mount Faber Park to get the cable car across to Sentosa island and although it was a little bit scary initially it was definitely an amazing view!

The journey took us over land and over the water high above the docked cruise ship. It was a nicer way than taking a cab or train so would definitely recommend it.

Sentosa island is also worth a visit so why not take a ride on the cable car to get there."
,,very nice,5.0,,cable car ride enjoy with family.and i like side seen suntosa beachand ilike very much.i wish go again cable car.
,,Far above Cruise ships,4.0,,The view from the Cable Car across to Sentosa Island is fantastic. It costs $26 return and runs until 9.45pm. You board the cars just a short walk down from MRT HarbourFront. The ride only lasts 5 minutes but is worth it for the view. A commentary points out things to look for. Soon after taking off you pass over Cruise Ships docked below in Keppel Harbour. At the maximum height of 60 meters you can see far beyond Sentosa to ships in the Singapore Straits. City views are spectacular also.
,,Great way to fly over land and water!,5.0,,"The cable car is short but great way to fly over water and land and see fantastic Singapore sky lines. If you plan to travel atleast twice and you are atleast 4 and you know any singapore resident, then you DO NOT have to pay the expensive 26 SGD. A family of four just need to pay SGD 99 For a year...yes for a year unlimited rides. I do not see a reason why people pay SGD 26 per person for a single ride."
,,A must do !,5.0,,"Although a little daunting, this candle car ride is absolutely awesome.... Arguably the best ride in Singapore.... I'd recommend you how one way from Mount Faber and the catch the MRT from Sentosa back to your location..... Because it will save you $28 pp and you won't be stuck up on Mt Faber waiting for an expensive cab ride....
As I have said this is a must do"
,,Great View,4.0,,"My husband wanted to do this because he had read there was an amazing view of the port and cargo ships. He was a little disappointed by the view, but part of the port could be seen. It does offer a great view of the overall harbor and part of the shipping port. It offers views of the city. It is worth the price and time. It was a little warm inside the car. There are two small fans that were not moving fast enough. The car is vented and has windows that were open. However, it was still stuffy and no drinks allowed. It's a unique experience that is worth the trip."
,,Allow enough time to enjoy this great ride,4.0,,"We had one day in Singapore and a midnight flight out - what to do? Not being fans of guided tours, we decided to try the cable car - what a great choice! We started at Harbourfront which was an easy trip from the centre of town on the MTR (clean and orderly train system - nice!) We headed to Sentosa first - had no idea it was so big. We enjoyed a cheap and tasty meal at Ruyi (Hot & Sour soup with wantons and steamed pork buns - yum!), wandered around and enjoyed a punt at the casino. Late in the day we headed up the hill for sunset drinks at Mt Faber. Enjoyed happy hour (NZ Sav Blanc at a reasonable price) at the outside cafe outside of the cable car station - amazing views and lovely service. So it was getting dark as we headed back to Harbourfront. This was a great way to see Singapore in one day."
,,"""What an Enchanted Moment""",5.0,,"Wow...the first words we both uttered when we first step in inside the cable car...Amazingly beautiful!!! When it started to pull over we're all speechless.. what an ENCHANTED PLACE like no other...the sun settings and the moon rising were spectacular moments for us during our rides..city lights, roads and buildings lights were amazingly beautiful...my family enjoy the cable car rides and we feel safe knowing that our tour guide as well told us that SAFETY is one of SINGAPORE Government Priority and cable car operations will not be possible should this has been unsafe to all riders....I am recommending to SGP Visitors and Travelers to try this one of a lifetime experience...really wow!!!"
,,Quite enjoyable,4.0,,"We arrived fairly early, around 10 am, there was a bit of a crowd an line up but not too much. The ride itself was nice, you get nice views of Sentosa and Singapore. The ride over was fairly short, it took merely around 10 minutes.

We bought a package and had to wait when we arrived for the local guide. In the mean time we had to kill 30 minutes in the ""Cable car museum"" which is so boring its hard to comprehend. Items are dusty and the place feels like its more of a space to gather tourists when they arrive and have to wait, rather than a museum.

It's a bit pricey but at the same time a really lovely way of getting to Sentosa while you relax and enjoy a local attraction.

On our way back around 4 pm the queues going to Sentosa were quite long so if you don't like waiting around, come early."
,,Enjoyable view,4.0,,"Nice view heading over and back to Sentosa Island/Mt Faber. The cable cars are modern and clean. Having done the Kuranda (Queensland, Australia) cable car several times, I was prepared for the height. This doesn't take very long and is S$26 return so not the cheapest way to get to Sentosa and back but good for a different perspective."
,,It ain't as cheap as chips,5.0,,"Now information seems to vary, but it's my understanding this is either the longest or highest cable car in South East Asia (some anorak will surely correct whichever is wrong).

It isn't cheap so go with friends, not all your children if Singapore is already hurting your budget. But you do get a great view of Sentosa Island, of Singapore itself and the massive dock area as well as views over to the city centre. It really is a wonderful view that extends out to the lines of ships waiting to dock.

The whole trip itself is a little over five minutes. And the 'mainland' terminal is not in a particularly salubrious setting or surrounds but it is a short walk to a rather fancy looking hotel whose taxi rank you can use...

Anyway, it is a great experience though expensive and only for special occasions, you'd never choose to do this as your mode of getting to Sentosa for multiple days of sightseeing especially as it lobs you pretty much on the opposite end of the island to the S.E.A Aquarium and Movieworld which are the two man attractions of Sentosa for most people.

But go on ya big kid, do it at least once!"
,,Is Singapore for real?,5.0,,Cable car lets you see Singapore from the heavens and in solitude. You still find peace in the concrete jungle. Select a good season but not the peak season to enjoy yourselves
,,A good view,4.0,,We went to Mount Faber by coach to take the Cable Car to Sentosa. It is a nice hill and the roads were nicely maintained. Very quite place and the views are great. I would like to visit this place again.
,,Rip Off,2.0,,Family of 5 Was ridiculously expensive Cost over $100 for us to travel by cable cars There was no air conditioning in the cars and only tiny windows Found out the next day we could walk to island for $1 each View was nice but ride was short and deinately not worth it
,,Very good experience,4.0,,"This is my first cable car ride, and it was awesome experience, the beautiful greenish view from the top, skyline, express highways.... I believe this is one of the must item whoever visiting Singapore...."
,,Amazing View,4.0,,Try the cable Car to reach Sentosa. Its Exhilarating...gives a good view of the Bay..as well as the Cruise ships docked there. You can opt for a day pass offering unlimited rides in the cable car.
,,Nice views,4.0,,We went to Mt Faber to get the cable car to Sentosa - it offered some great views of the city & the harbour and we're really glad we made the trip.
,,good way to visit Sentosa,4.0,,Took the cable car from Mount Faber to Sentosa and back. No queues on a busy Saturday afternoon but a wait for the taxi at the end back at Mt Faber. Views were great and the boys loved it. Quite expensive for the time the trip took. Better reductions for children would be good.
,,Ask yourself if it is really necessary,3.0,,"The Singapore Cable Car first opened in 1974 and acts as a form of aerial transportation between Sentosa and Mount Faber across the Keppel Harbour. It is one of the main tourist attractions on Sentosa, with over 80 pods carrying up to 8 passengers each.

I usually get a taxi or the cheap and efficient MRT when I want to go to Sentosa (there are fantastic dining outlets at Sentosa) although for a change I thought why don’t I make the journey on the famous cable car. I do have a fear of heights, but I was prepared to risk my life on this occasion! It is not as steep as the epic Langkawi Cable Car in Malaysia, nor the ropeway at Table Mountain in Cape Town, but it is still very high above the harbour giving amazing panoramic views of the area. From the Jewel Box at Mount Faber (which has a great café, by the way), I headed down to Sentosa: Singapore’s playground!

I can remember paying S$29 for my adult one way ticket. I cannot remember how much the return fare was, but I only wanted to do one journey anyway (I don’t think my vertigo could have taken much more!). The queue for the cable car once you have purchased your ticket is always very busy, and I stood there for a long time waiting for a pod to become available. It must have taken a good half hour from when I bought my ticket to when I entered the actual pod and got moving. Anyhow, there were amazing views as we immediately pulled out of the station. The Singapore Cable Car is not really a long ride – it only lasts around 10 minutes in the air – but as with all things in Singapore there was a great ambience to the whole thing and you could see that families and young children were enjoying the spectacular setting. I had an Indian family in my pod with me, which made taking videos quite difficult but I made sure I had a lot of photos of my experience!

At the beginning and end of your journey there are opportunities to buy various merchandise and souvenirs, but to be honest it all looked a bit tacky to me (stuff like ‘I Love SG’ T-shirts), so I just walked through the gift shops and out into what was Imbiah Lookout on Sentosa, quite near the Tiger Sky Tower. It would be interesting to compare the views from the Cable Car and the Sky Tower, and maybe I will get a chance to do so soon!

But if you are heading for the Singapore Cable Car, bear in mind the hefty price, and ask yourself if it would be more economical to take a taxi to Sentosa instead (or even cheaper, the MRT). The views are amazing from the Cable Car ride, but you can get aerial views of Singapore for less $$$ elsewhere."
,,Great day out on Sentosa via Cablecar,4.0,,"It was easy to find on Harbourfront on MTR the staff in the booking office were really helpful and polite, our trip include a trip to the aquarium on Sentosa which was amazing"
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"Ride through cable car from Singapore city to Sentosa Island was really a fine experience. Like Singapore flyer, I did enjoy the panoramic view of the surrounding areas. Though about a 15 minutes ride, yet one feels rightly enchanted. It became an added attraction to have captured the view by taking snapshots or using the movie camera. The night time ride offers a more charming scenario.
Right from the start of the journey I had few options to purchase tickets as per my liking. Though a bit expensive, nevertheless it’s all worth the attractions. The official lady guide briefed the visitors about the upcoming attractions and frankly it was all wonderful."
,,Good for a short ride,3.0,,Nothing much to do in the cable car. Goes up-to the hill and back. The views are excellent in the evening when you can see the sunset from the car. Good views of Singapore from the car.
,,Head for heights,5.0,,The only way to see the sights of Singapore is from the cable car. The trip from Mount Faber to Sentosa Island never fails to amaze me. We were unfortunate in that it rained on our way out but hardly got our shorts wet before the sun had dried everything up. Sentosa is now heavily commercialised and apart from being the end of the cable car is best avoided.
,,Amazing views,5.0,,"We did the full round trip on the cable car. The wheelchair access was really easy and the staff were very helpful. The cafe at the top of the cable car had good coffee, very reasonable prices and fabulous views."
,,Fantastic if a little scary,5.0,,Travelled up the mountain from universal studios and the views are amazing we had a pod to our selfs no waiting very slick operation No commentary in pod or it was not working which was a shame a must do xx
,,A bird's eye view of the city,4.0,,"I had a few hours to spare & decided the cable car was a good way to spend them.
It was 26SGD for the cable car which is quite a lot for what you get - just the cable car ride however it was still a nice way to see Singapore. The price of the ticket gives you a round trip to Sentosa. I didn't find it particularly well signed but I still managed to find my way around. The cable car, to begin with, takes you away from Sentosa which was slightly worrying however when I reached the first stop (even though it was terribly signed) it became obvious to me that this was part of the round trip tour.
Sentosa itself is nice however the cable car ticket only gives you the cable car, if you want to see any other attractions at Sentosa you need to pay extra; which explains why there are lots of signs at the ticket office trying to sell you packages giving you entrance to a few attractions.
I think doing it once is enough, I'm not sure if I was back in Singapore again if I would do another trip on the cable car. It was a nice way to fill in a few hours even though the day I did it, it was about 1000 degrees & walking around in the sun wasn't high on the 'to-do' list.
I'm not sure if you were a family of four if this attraction would tick all the right boxes especially considering everything cost something...maybe you would be better off looking at getting a joint pass to see a few of the attractions to keep the kids entertained."
,,Worth every dime..,5.0,,for 26 dallars ( the way singaporeans say it) we could spend nearly 4 hrs. It was amazing and the facilities are impecable. Food at sentosa can be had at MALAYSIAN street food which is the only aaffordable and quality place in the region.. Be prepared to walk a lot. Not for the elderly and parents with young kids. enjoy.
,,Enjoyed the view but too pricey,3.0,,"Once in the cable cable, take a quick look around you to enjoy the view of singapore city, sentosa island, the port, ships, sea. (What else?)
Felt like it took less than 10 minutes. Nice to try it once, but probably will use the train or bus the next time (to sentosa island)."
,,Do if for the views,4.0,,"At the end of our first day, we ran in to this and although we really didn't need to be going someplace in particular, we rode this just for the aerial views. It was very nice. We found quite a few others that were doing it for the same purpose of just being there for the views although I know that most will be using it as transportation from point A to point B."
,,great way to get to sentosa,5.0,,"Great views, kids loved it, staff helpful and friendly. We went midweek, no queues as all. Quite short ride but fun. Mount Faber disappointing, probably better to go at sunset and see city lights."
,,view of Sentosa Island,4.0,,"In going to Sentosa i recommend via cable car. While on top you can see the beautiful view of the
city and Sentosa Island in particular. Aerial view of a place is more attactive than from the ground.
Inside tha island you can go around to many beautiful attractions. There are various delicious
food establishments and shops where one can buy some souvenirs. The whole place is very
clean. The fees are minimal and affordable."
,,Good views,4.0,,"It seems nothing is more than 15-20 mins from anywhere else (except the airport) in Singapore. It only takes 10-15 mins for the cable car to Sentosa to reach the island from its starting point in Mount Faber Park. its a great view as you sail over the tree tops to Sentosa. Once on the island there are a selection of things to do. You can go back in time and do the Butterfly Farm, 4D rides and the old aquarium, all of which were fun or try some of the later addition rides like Universal Studios, the new aquarium or water park."
,,"Try it Once, That'll be Enough.",3.0,,"The Singapore Cable Car offers a nice view of the city and the Sentosa area, but it's a quick ride, and your ticket is only good for one round-trip transfer. I was able to get a discounted ticket with a bank card promo, which made me feel better. But I would've been more disappointment had I paid full price for the ticket.

If you're visiting Singapore for holiday and are looking to visiting Mount Faber Park and Sentosa, then I'd say it's a nice way to connect to those places. If you're traveling with children, then I think they'll enjoy the bird's eye view of Sentosa.

The cable car is one of those things you do just to say you did it - not something that you would do more than once."
,,Flying over the sea,5.0,,Nice view from the new decoration / version of Singapore Cable Car. Start from Mount Faber / Harbourfront to Sentosa. Don't forget to visit Cable Car Museum & Cable Car Shop to get some souvenirs.
,,Jewel Card - ridiculous customer service,5.0,,"The extended family and I have been on a number of cable cars in various places around the world. This experience is worthy, fun and has wonderful views. The cable cars are well maintained and cleaned every trip.

Entry from Harbour Front Station towards Sentosa is via a lift with windows on three sides giving a thrilling preview of the ride. It's a pity that the lift that is used for rides towards the Jewel Box is windowless. Whilst we were there, the cable car passed over several cruise liners allowing us a dramatic view of the decks of the boats. The cable car is also higher than the lame Tiger Sky Tower. The Jewel Box Station is a worthwhile visit except nothing is open in the morning except for the gift shop.

Each family group purchased the 'Family' Jewel Card as we were in Singapore for the week and were going to Sentosa most days. The card is good value with limitless rides for a year and payed for itself after a single return trip. The cable car is the least economical way of visiting Sentosa but certainly the best fun.

BE WARNED -------- BE WARNED -------- BE WARNED

Purchasing the Jewel Card is probably more laborious and frustrating than trying to get permission to visit secret nuclear weapon bases in North Korea or Iran.

Seriously it was a real pain. We had to fill in a form with our full names, passport numbers, address, date of birth. Then each of us had to have a photograph and be issued an individual card. It took over an excruciating hour to have 11 cards issued to each family member.

Here is a suggestion. Issue one family card per family, one photograph only (if it's really necessary to have a photo) of the main card holder and just the name of each family member (if it's really necessary to have each name). This would save a huge amount of time and improve customer service. It's really unlikely that travel on the cable car by Jewel Card holders is even faintly likely to be abused."
,,Astonishing views,5.0,,We did return trip to Sentosa with 2 young children and they loved it. We bought a day pass from Vivo city station and chose the cable car as it was suitable for our 1 year old and 3 year old. It is a short trip but definitely worth doing it. lots of great pictures of the harbour and Sentosa island!!!
,,Enjoyble but not great value for money...,4.0,,"At S$29 for a round-trip journey it’s the costliest mode of transport to reach Resorts World Sentosa… Is it the most enjoyable mode? Yes, it is. But, is it the best value for money? Probably not.

It’s not a very long ride but it does offer excellent aerial view of the harbour and Sentosa Island… lots of photo-ops on the way. But, there are much more scenic and thrilling cable car rides in Asia like in Hong Kong and Taiwan etc and if you have been to one of them you may not quite find this one very exciting. So, in my opinion if this is your first cable car ride then certainly take it. But, don’t use it if your only intension is to use it as a mode of transport. Because you can reach Sentosa for just S$1 by Boardwalk or for S$4 by Sentosa Express.

If you are using cable car don’t forget to go to Jewel Box Station which is the last station on your return from Sentosa. Jewel Box is a lovely hilltop destination located on top of Mount Faber hill. The calm and sedate ambience and rain forest surroundings makes it an excellent place for a leisurely meal or a drink while enjoying the scenic view from the top."
,,Really special evening,5.0,,This was a return trip to Sentosa and the on the previous visit we promised ourselves that we would have dinner next time and so to celebrate my son's birthday I made a reservation just before we left the UK. It was very straightforward to make the reservation. So pleased that we did this - it felt really special floating around the circuit as the sun went down over the beautiful views. Each time around a new course is put in and the old plates cleared away. The food was beautifully presented and tasty although there was not much choice on the menu. We wondered why they did not have more local dishes but that said what was served was delicious. The staff were all very friendly and efficient. I would definitely recommend this as a lovely evening out.
,,Gallery for Rich,3.0,,"Singapore is really a glamorous city, highly expensive and excellently planned. it was a business tour for 4 days. I had to be on wheels but tried best to gallop as much as I could with eyes. every place of attraction was expensive. I tried the cable car for the first time in my life and I believe it was never a wastage. Marina bay, Sentosa Island are best for kids or fun lovers as there are so many amusements. I loved to visit the Sentosa fort where the memories from WWII was treasured so nicely. I hate to go to Mustafa it is nothing but a crowd but may the people who must buy something for family on return may visit and it is the only shopping place open 24hours. most of the Bangladeshis were around it, like Little Bangla."
,,MUST VISIT,5.0,,"One of the best cable car I've been to :) Located in Sentosa Island and the fee is not very expensive (Only sgd $26). I will visit here again. Oh yes, No food allowed in the cable car.."
,,Fun experience,4.0,,"Its not exactly cheap but its certainly fun, i did one in hong kong and i think both are a must as u can see a whole view of the city. I didn't try the night ride with dinner though, which i think could be another exciting experience."
,,MUST Visit,5.0,,"Cable car to Sentosa is a wonderful experience with the ride going on top of the sea and then to the resort. Also it is more convenient way to reach to this place as it is near to MRT (Harbour Front).

Little costlier compared to MRT, but recommended atleast 1 way."
,,Cable Car Ride,5.0,,thoroughly enjoyed the cable car...well worth the sgd$26 as you can stay on the whole ride or jump on & off at 2 points to see the tourist sites around the cable car....lovely views of Singapore & a hood overview of everything....I believe they are going to extend it further which will be great also. Very worthwhile attraction to see.
,,not bad at all,4.0,,"recommend the full round trip, not exactly cheap but enjoyable - great way to enjoy the sunset which is what we did on our way back up to mount faber where you will find one or two nice restos and a washroom with a nice harbour view!

they also have this dinner special for 2 which looks pretty romantic (yeh from a bloke), could be a good place to propose to your girl!"
,,filled in a bit of time!,3.0,,"Depending of what your expectations are, we were a little disappointed. It was $26 for each person and the experience was not that worth while compared to the Marina Bay sky park. We did not feel the need to get off at any of the stops. Compared to other flyers in the world it was just ok for us!"
,,A fun trip,5.0,,The cable car ride from Harbourfront to Sentosa is a fun trip and a great way to arrive on the island. You can buy a return ticket from Harbourfront to Sentosa and return via Mount Faber so you can enjoy the full round trip. Fantastic views all round - we got some great photos.
,,well worth it,5.0,,"Great view, about 1/2 hour round trip . Best to buy as a package at sentosa island . Also best to go during the week as you have more chance of a carriage to yourself"
,,Fantastic views,5.0,,Had a great trip on the Singapore cable car over the harbour - the views are absolutely stunning - highly recommended if you are ever in Singapore and reasonably inexpensive
,,It was okay,3.0,,"I got lucky as was able to time the ride just perfectly to catch the sunset. The views were spectacular, and the photographs, had I been able to take any, would have been stunning. There in lies my one complaint. I understand that safety is critical, but having even a small opening in the Plexiglas cover that would allow for a clear, non-glass reflective, photo would have been wonderful. As it was, all of the pictures are in my mind. Next time I may investigate the dining option in the car."
,,wonderful views,5.0,,the cable car ride from mount faber to sentosa island and back is fantastic the views are stunning take your camera ipad video so much to see and you get some wonderful pictures I would recommend this trip to everyone
,,Great view of the city,4.0,,"A great way to get a birds eye view of the city, port and Sentosa Island. Very clean and safe, the ride is a good length. The staff were very friendly too."
,,If you have a few hours to spare,3.0,,"I just had the full afternoon in Singapore so we spent time at Sentosa and took the cable car. I skimmed the island a bit overland. But we had to pay SD$26.00 each.

The weather in Singapore, when I visited, by the way was crazy. It was searing hot when I arrived just before lunch time. My friend and I were in Sentosa in the afternoon when it begun to drizzle. By the time were in one of the cable cars, it was raining hard. It was thrilling, to say the least. It was fun, as well. So unfortunate, I had such a short stay."
,,Don't be afraid of heights!!,5.0,,"Well it started off as a hair raising experience, but once my nerves calmed down to was exciting to see the area and have a view of Singapore and Sentosa. Take the whole round trip to be sure to get the whole experience. A nice way to get to and from the island."
,,Bird's Eye View of Sentosa Is,4.0,,"Excellent way to approach Sentosa Island - good view over to the shipping port. No queue and we did not need to share our ""car"". Goes pretty high, so if you don't like heights, the Light Rail might be a better option."
,,Exellent View from Singapore Cable Car,4.0,,"I visited Singapore with my wife and 16 month-old daughter. We were staying nearby Orchard Road and It took around 20 minutes to reach the The Jewel Box Station at Mount Faber by taxi. There are 3 stations. These are Jewel Box, HarbourFront and Imbiah Station Sentosa. I recommend you to get on the cable car from Jewel Box Station otherwise the trip will be too short from HarbourFront to Sentosa Island. This was my third experience on a cable car. The others were Hong Kong and Zell am See whose rides were longer than Singapore cable car trip. Although I was not satisfied for the duration of the trip, I really enjoyed the scenery. This cable car is one of the best place to take photo in Singapore.
We had our meal in a restaurant at Jewel Box Station and the scenery was also great. Kids menu and high chair were available. Boarding was easy and we had no problem while getting on the cable car with a baby. The ride was smooth and relaxing. It is also giving us a good opportunity to observe the facilities at Sentosa Island. For the return trip from Sentosa Island I prefer to get out the cable car at HarbourFront Station because It is not easy to find a taxi at Mount Faber during night. Nearby HarbourFront Station we got on MRT (metro) because the queue at the taxi stand was too long."
,,Bet way to get on and off Sentosa!,5.0,,"No line up! No crowded car! Great, friendly staff! Spectacular views and comfortable seats. Just be careful of trying to get a cab to return to the city centre or hotels!!!"
,,Great views; Fun way to get to Sentosa,4.0,,"The cable cars are a fun way to get over to Sentosa. Not too expensive, but worth the cost. We love the relaxing ride in anticipation of a great day on Singapore's play place. Enjoy."
,,Joyride at SCC,5.0,,We bought the round trip ticket from Mt. Faber to Sentosa and vice versa. The ride is somewhat scary at first since it's my first time to ride a cable car. The cable car can accommodate 6 persons and the ride is smooth and we alighted at Sentosa Station. You can also buy different types souvenirs at the Sentosa Station. We took our trip back to Mt. Farber and the night view is awesome. The only problem we encounter is having a hard time getting a taxi ride at Mt. Farber during night time.
,,Top view,5.0,,Scaring but fantastic to have a ride. Good for photography lovers. Excellent views from top over Sentosa island. Highly recommended.
,,View of harbour,3.0,,The cable car from Harbourbay up to Mount Faber is reletively short (only couple of minutes) and maily shows parts of the harbour. You can't see any of the Singapore skyline from here. The open sea is to far away for a good look. All and all a little dissappointing.
,,Good Experience !,4.0,,"The Singapore Cable Car is a great way to go to Sentosa, or Mount Faber with fabulous views of the Singapore strait and the surrounding islands. It would an approx. 20 mins ride from Mount Faber to Sentosa and back, but it's worth the time, especially if you're on a date ;)"
,,one more experience,5.0,,"I would highly recommend to go first to Singapore Flyer and then to Cable car fror the upper point. U will have different view of Singapore. Flyer is a business center and Sentosa is a leasure part of Singapore. Ucan do round-trip with no stop or u can buy round ticket with staying at Sentosa and visiting its Oceanarium, Aquapark and cafes. The whole trip is safe, u could enjoy great views."
,,Thrilling ride to Sentosa Island..,5.0,,"We rode the Singapore Cable Car on July 2013 to reach Sentosa Island for the first time. You can reach Sentosa in a number of ways: bus, car, monorail, or cable car-- definitely go for the cable car on your first time or at least once (If I remember correctly the basic ticket costs SD38.00)! Check the back of your ticket because some freebies are printed there! We found out that ours had free entrance to the Songs of the Sea show too late (we already bought tickets to the show then)! We went at 8:00 am and there was a slight drizzle during that time.

On our first ride, we all actually became quite nervous seeing the height above the open water which we were all to ride over. When we actually rode we were all quite jittery especially during the first drop. After that, however, it was all smooth sailing. The view was amazing, even though it was not yet sunny. Upon disembarkation, make sure to visit the Cable Car Museum to look in awe at the transformation of the iconic Singaporean attraction over the years."
,,Terrific experience,5.0,,We were able to buy a ticket that allowed unlimited access and additional attractions. Unfortunately we were short of time and could not take advantage but we enjoyed the views and we will definitely go back.
,,Romantic sunset ride,5.0,,"My husband and I took the evening ride from harbour front to mt faber. We were lucky to catch the setting sun. Oh my, it was breathtaking! We couldn't stop clicking our cameras! It's a very romantic way to propose for marriage from your partner. High up in the air, with the setting sun in the background. Get a third person to help you take pictures of course!"
,,"Access from cable car ride,from harbourfront centre",5.0,,"There are 3 cable car stations, namely sentosa, harbourfront centre ( beside harbourfront MRT ) and Mount Faber. Buy the round trip ticket. It allows u to start from harbourfront, travel towards mount faber. Alight to walk around and explore the area. Easy to walk pathways. One of the most beautiful mountain Parks in Singapore.

Take the cable ride again, towards sentosa. After you are done with sentosa. Take the ride back to harbourfront . This is by far the easiest way to access mount faber.

Note that sentosa needs a separate day on its own to visit universal studio, and the various attractions on the island. The itinerary above allows for only a few hours, perhaps half a day to enjoy a few attractions on the island. Arrange for another day trip, for universal studio,water cove adventure park and sea aquarium."
,,lovely views,4.0,,"Expensive, and a long queue to buy the tickets (not sure if you can buy them online but do if you can) but the view is amazing and a one-off trip as you can get off Sentosa by the free Sentosa Express."
,,Superb view,5.0,,An enjoyable experience with marvelous view of Sentosa. Not much people on the queue. Have bought the S$38 package with unlimited cable car ride + songs of the sea + skyline luge. Value for money. Taking cable car at night is romantic. The night view is so nice - you cannot enjoy that if you take Sentosa Express or through Sentosa Boardwalk. Try taking cable car to Mount Faber before the sky is dark. I went there at night and all the shops (except a restaurant and souvenir shop) are closed. Definitely will take cable car again!
,,A viewing experience,4.0,,Went from Sentosa to the mainland. Great views and phot opportunities. Interesting that it passes through a building on its route. There was not a lot at the other end so had a drink a quick look round and then back again. It was worth it for the views and the weather was good apart from a little rain on the way back.
,,Excellent views and great service,5.0,,We had a great time going from mount Faber to sentosa on the cable car. We had one to ourselves as a family and the kids had a great thrill from the short ride across to sentosa. The views were just stunning and we took great shots of sentosa from above as well as the cruise ships at dock.
,,Great Views!,4.0,,"The cable car provides great views of the Sentosa island and mainland Singapore. If there is a cruise ship standing on the day, you'd get a great of that as well. The cars themselves are not well ventilated though and the fans inside don't help much. Luckily we did not find any queues so it was quite smooth that way."
,,Great Views even during the storm,4.0,,"We took the cable car from Sentosa to Singapore and the views were amazing we could even see the dolphins in the pools below.
We bought a ticket package which included the cable car! It was a really good trip. I would recommend this to anyone visiting the area!"
,,expensive,3.0,,Was a good view but sgd222 for a one way trip for 10 minutes was way over the top. would not recommend. better to do the singapore flyer
,,A fantastic view... Very expensive one way,4.0,,"Our family had a tour to Universal Studios that included transfers to Sentosa. We decided to catch the Cable Car back to the main island. Hardly any change from S$100 it was an expensive 10 minute trip back. On a positive note, the view was awesome. Although the carriages are not air conditioned they offer the maximum view.

In hindsight, it would have been better value to use it as a return trip. We know better for next time!"
,,great experience with cable car,4.0,,"That was a very great experience to be up the cable car. this ride plus the freebies make u have funny. Don't forget to get your freebies (coffee and cake) at one of the stops. If you wanna to get this ride,should take tour package from trust agent. It would save you a lot, and they will help you all"
,,Santosa island,5.0,,Took the cable car to Santosa island... Great views and lovely place...went to sea world aquarium ..wow this place huge and one of the best aquariums I have ever visited ...really interesting ANC definitely worth a visit..even through you must queue up to get a ticket ...it worth it.
,,CRUISE IN YOUR CABLE CAR !!,5.0,,"THE cable car provides an aerial link from Mt. Faber to the popular island resort of Sentosa . Each cabin is suspended approx. sixty meters above the sea ; the entire ride takes only twelve minutes . This view needs to be seen to be believed, on a clear day you CAN see forever, passing over part of the port area before heading towards Sentosa and its attractions .. keep that camera handy !!!!"
,,Getting really overcharged,1.0,,Went to Clarke quay singapore Monday night had to pay 85singapore dollars for 3 glasses of wine and they charged 28 dollars for a glass of champagne what a rip off people beware the bars at Clarke quay They send youngsters to serve you so you cannot check up be aware send these rip off people broke
,,Great ride!!! Excellent view!!!,4.0,,"It was a great experience up the cable car.

I enjoy this ride plus the freebies. Don't forget to get your freebies (coffee and cake) at one of the stops.

If you wish to try this ride, I would suggest you try the duck tour package. It would save you a lot. For less than a hundred Singapore dollar, you could enjoy a package of 3-day tour plus bus transfer from one attraction to all the others like the museums, the flyer, Singapore botanical gardens, and a lot more."
,,Excellent view of Singapore on a clear day,4.0,,"Great ride, very efficient. I would have preferred clear glass windows instead of tinted so I could get good photos. It didn't help that it was a smoggy day either but the ride and chance to get a big picture view was worthwhile"
,,Cable Car,4.0,,We arrived there at 1830 and at 1900 there was a discount for couple including a soft drink and pop corn :). Access is easy from imbiah station then through up to escalators and you can get a round trip. yes it is expensive way to reach main land from sentosa but a short peirod of fun you can have. the view is nice and it is a must in singapore. however for a better view you can use tiger sky tower. but cable cars always is a part of a trip :)
,,Tourists Beware,3.0,,"Nice view of the harbour and Sentosa Island but expensive - as many things are in Singapore anyway - compared to the monorail option. Pretty short ride too. Forget the ""Adventure"" package. Its a lot more expensive but combines the cable car ride with several attractions on Sentosa. The Sea aquarium is a must see but others (Merlion) not so much. While the Segway and Luge rides are also good, the line ups are long and your high-end-can't-live-with- out ""Adventure"" ticket only provides one round for each while most other riders opt for a ticket to go three times. The Chill Out drink at the end is nothing exotic like depicted - just bottled water or a pop. Ripoff."
,,Must do while in Singapore,4.0,,"If you visit Singapore, the cable car is a must. The views are spectacular. I joined the cable car at Waterfront, went up to Mount Faber, then across to Sentosa Island. Fantastic, ensure you have your camera!"
,,Not for those who don't like heights!,5.0,,"The MOST amazing cable car ride! You can get off at several stops to appreciate the views of Singapore and enjoy a good day out.There were attractions, restaurants, gift shops etc. We were short of time so stayed on. Luckily we had the car to ourselves throughout and so could take wonderful photos. The views from Sentosa were the best. The car goes quite high but is very smooth."
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,It is a wonderful experience and a must go while going to Sentosa.The Angry Birds in and on the cable car add more fun element for kids.
,,Sail over Singapore,5.0,,Great value for the cost. Make sure you leave from the Mt Faber and sit back and enjoy the ride and views. Then stroll around Sentosa Island for a full day of sights and fun.
,,A Must Do !!! Fantastic,5.0,,"I would thoroughly recommend this ride as it is just so magnificent the view of Singapore, you can see Sentosa Island, Universal studios. Great for all ages. AMAZING!!"
,,A Must go if you are going to Singapore,4.0,,"Paradise in the sky , a very quiet and exotic ride. We had the chance of going back in the night after finishing universal studios and since it was the last ride we even got free drinks and some pop corn.. also the ticket prices were at half price , don't know whether this is the norm once you are heading out of sentosa island however it was simply breathtaking ."
,,cable all the way :),5.0,,"1. you need to pay s$d 26 to have a round trip ride from jewel box to sentosa island. it will take you 20 mins for a one way ride .

2. it has a stunning view of resorts world and sentosa island and singapore from the cable car. you can also eat inside the cable car.

3. when reaching sentosa you can explore the island first or there are so many things that you can do like ride the tiger sky , ride the luge, zipline, see the images of singapore, have a picture with snake and parrot, lion view deck, starbucks is available eat icecream at stick house (for for a fee)"
,,"What a Magnificent Ride,",5.0,,"Not a great fan of cable cars(height wise), but my daughter wanted to go to Sentosa Island via Cable Car. Excellent, thoroughly enjoyed it what a magnificent view. Could see Singapore, all of Sentosa . Universal Studios, really enjoyed the ride over and back."
,,The Views Are Amazing,4.0,,"We travelled from Mt Faber to Sentosa Island in the morning. We looked around Sentosa and returned back to Habour Front in the afternoon. Cost S$52 per couple.

The views were awesome and we were lucky that it was a fairly nice day. We had the added fortune of having a cruise ship docked on our return trip. We travelled over the top of the cruise ship and got a birds eye view of it.

Things to be aware of:
1. Tickets states that the company has the right to suspend (or cancel) travel on the cable car in the event of bad weather (which is fair enough). However, there will be no refund or compensation if they do so. Which in my mind is unfair - they should honour the ticket (one journey at least) on another occassion.

2. Taxi ride to Mt Faber is approximatley S$10-12. The ride costs the same if from Mt Faber or from Harbour Front. The return back to Mt Faber is great if you have your own transportation. Getting a taxi is dfficult from what we were told at Mt Faber."
,,Good views of Sentosa and the Singapore Straits,4.0,,"The top cable car station is at Mt Faber, a $10 taxi ride from the City. This is a great way to get to Sentosa Island. If you have never been on a cable car before it may not suit you but the experience is great and the views across to Sentosa Island and the busy shipping lanes of the Singapore Straits is well worth the trip. It is a little on the expensive side at $26 person one way but you can return to the city by monorail at a much cheaper price or alternatively by taxi which is inexpensive. At the Sentosa cable car terminal there are free buses to take you to the wide range of water attractions, beaches and the casino. There is plenty of WW2 history to take in and good walking."
,,Great views.,5.0,,"Our first trip on the cable cars since living in Singapore. We went on it with my father visiting from Australia. Fantastic views, no queues and good service."
,,Wow!,5.0,,"Took the one with the ""glass"" bottom, WOW! Certainly not for the faint-hearted, but a wonderful view, and a wonderful ride!"
,,A 'look out' and viewing 'must' during your unforgettable visit to beautiful Singapore...,4.0,,"A 'flying' taxi ride (that is another story) whizzed us down to the harbour right to the door where ticket purchasing was for our round-trip tickets - no walking or wondering where to go... Round-trip ticket ($26/per person) takes you HIGH up to Mt. Faber and the Jewel Box - highlight for me of the beautiful night views was seeing colourful Sentosa straight across the way and the next stop by cable car. Well-known restaurants and gift shop atop Mt. Faber - we enjoyed a cocktail & the views. Not many people/no crowds at 8:30pm... Back into a cable car - no waiting - down to the main car 'station' - no need to get off to go up the other way to Sentosa (make sure you do have ticket at hand for verification)... Sentosa Island was eerily quiet when we
arrived just before 9pm - greeted by another gift shop immediately out of the car and not much inviting within a reasonable distance to enjoy our surroundings with limited time (last car down is at 9:30pm)... There is so much to this island - clubs, casino, beach, Universal Studios, etc, etc, ETC - I believe it is a playground to tour for a full day if not a guest at the resort. Note: Cable cars are roomy, 'modern', clean and you can barely hear a sound as you 'cable' high above part of Singapore..."
,,Singapore Cable Car - MUST Do,5.0,,"Quality of cable car, time required to take a ride and actual ride time, views from top and at Mount Faber of Singapore are amazing.

Best is to take a ride from Sentosa to Mount Faber during evening time so that you can day time view and then on return night view."
,,Must do,4.0,,"After a stroll around Sentosa and a ""ride"" on the Tiger Sky Tower, we hopped onto the Singapore Cable Car more to find a cooler place as the temperature was hot and humidity high. Although not air conditioned the breeze through the cable car was welcomed along with stunning views of Sentosa. My wife who can feel a little uneasy at height was comfortable within the car until I started shifting around for photos which made the car sway a bit causing her some concern. We had the car to ourselves but with a number of people who might be shuffling around the car she would have found it disturbing. If it is not too busy wait the extra few minutes to have a car to yourself. It's a great experience with great views and a must do if you are in Singapore."
,,Good experience,4.0,,It was easy to get to this and good to have experienced it but its main purpose is to get people over to Santosa Island. It does provide a good opportunity to view Sentosa Island from above and it is amazing that the cable car goes through the middle of a building but it was much too hot for us to do much else on the day so basically all it was was a cable car ride there and back.
,,fantastic views,5.0,,Great experience went to Mt Faber had a walk around The Jewel Box Restaurant was closed still looked an amazing place then off to Sentosa Island for the day the Cable car was awesome sat back looked at all to c from high above great views coming into Sentosa didn't take long 5 min maybe a must do in Singapore :)
,,A wonderful view.....,5.0,,If you are planning to visit Sentosa.... take the Singapore Cable Car...... its a really good experience.....You can see almost the whole of Sentosa island and many more parts of Singapore and the water below adds to the thrill............
,,Quite an experience,5.0,,"Although I have been to Singapore four times before this, I had never been on the cable car. It's quite fun and an experience from which you can overlook part of Sentosa Island and many parts of Singapore, including the docks. Not for anybody with vertigo!"
,,WORTH it!,5.0,,Loved this. It was my second time in Singapore and this was very much worth doing again. The best views and the best attraction to take some nice pictures. Take the time to get out at mount faber and take a good stroll. The perfect place to watch the sun go down and see the city lights bright up.
,,Way too expensive,2.0,,"I was going ti sentosa at peak season, in december... Really long queque.. What i like is the beautiful scenery from above. We could see sentosa to vivo city.. What i dislike: it was too expensive for only short round. And what the worse was happening when the staff allowed other persons to sit with us in the same cable car.. I was going with my dad and mom, so total we were three. But, the staff allowed 2 someone else to be with us...

Really not worth every penny..."
,,Bird Eye View Over Sentosa,5.0,,Nice scenery above the sea from Mount Faber to Sentosa. Enjoy the ride unlimited back and forth in one day. Enjoy nice food at Jewel Box (Mount Faber) with nice view above the hill. Don't forget to visit 'Cable Car Museum' to see the development of the cable car since the first generation at the last stop.
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"You can either walk up the hill from Harbour centre, walk along the the Southern Ridges or best of all catch the cable car. The cable car ride is spectacular you can get on either at Harbour centre, Sentosa Island or Mount Faber. I went from Harbour centre to Sentosa then up to Mount Faber and it was fantastic with views everywhere."
,,Great view,5.0,,We visited the cable car ride with family on a sunday after lunch at mount faber. The view from the car is excellent. I just loved it. Infact my 7 year daughter simply freaked out taking pictures of the view. Must visit.
,,Awesome views,4.0,,"We really enjoyed the cable car trip over to Sentosa island the views are great. The staff operating it were friendly and efficient. I do think at S$96 for a one way trip lasting about 10-15minutes its a tad pricey considering a taxi ride costs about s$11, that's why I gave it a very old and not excellent. I thinks it's definitely a must do in Singapore but I wouldn't do it again due to the cost."
,,High in the sky,5.0,,"This was a great way to see Singapore, not for the faint hearted its the highest cable car I have ever been on, goes over the harbour, fantastic views . Was just a wee bit scared....they have special carriages decked out with flowers for dinners or weddings etc. was really good."
,,Spectacular,4.0,,"A cheap taxi drive from the city centre - around $10. We started at the top of the hill. Starting at the second 'get on' point would reduce the impact a lot.
The views are amazing if you are new to Singapore, so take a camera."
,,Great views but disappointing experience,3.0,,"This had been 'bigged-up' to us and in truth the scale and scope of the project is huge and the views undoubtedly great. But, on arrival at Mt Faber from Tower 2, there is the usual tacky gift stuff, a closed restaurant and no little bar to sit and drink in the view. Take the journey on to Senosa and all that is there is a theme park and some tacky exhibitions. This was the most disappointing part of our Singapore experience. Do it for the thrill of a cable car experience, but don't expect more."
,,Fun ride to Sentosa,5.0,,"Take a taxi to the top of Mount Faber and begin your trip here. Try to time your trip as sunset is happening. On your return trip, get off at the halfway mark as there are no taxis at the top. The taxis queue by the shopping mall. The views are spectacular."
,,Great View over the Mountain and Sea,5.0,,The Cable car goes a lot higher and a great sea view and forest view. One way you should take it to sentosa.Its a great way to enter the Island. Its a 15min ride.
,,A must for Singapore trip,5.0,,The cable car goes over the forested area which was extremely nice. Recommended for everyone. A good alternate to driving to Sentosa. You get the entire view of the water park. A very nice experience.
,,Scared of heights?,4.0,,This cable car is certainly worth the ride. Provided you [ and the family] are not afraid of heights then this one is for you. The kids will love it. A great view so take the camera
,,Very Relaxing,5.0,,"We found this attraction to be relaxing and overall worth the value. Great views of the Universal Studios and the Water Park. Also traveled right over the top over the cruise ships anchored at the port. You are able to purchase just one way tickets or round trip. One way was sufficient for us. Watch for the unique architecture of the sky rises. They appear curved. If you get off at the Universal Park side, be sure to check out the Merlion statue. It is huge!"
,,Scenic view of Singapore,4.0,,This was a good way to get an overall feel for the layout of Singapore. It is best to ride it starting at the top of Mt Faber hill. It goes to Sentosa Island and back. Great views in every direction.
,,Great way to get to Sentosa.,4.0,,Well worth it. Great views and you can see many of the attractions before you get there. Return trip is included in the price. It album includes a trip to Mt Faber but I couldn't see anything there but a gift shop?
,,lovely at night,5.0,,"Its near Vivo City, we went and got our tickets and they gave us some popcorn, we got in and it went faster then I expected. The view was lovely, we went over the water and ended up at the gift shop in Sentosa Island, we spent some time there in Sentosa, then we had return ride ticket, I also was happy to see they have handicap and wheelchair access for cable cars. Best way to go from the mall to Sentosa and back."
,,PANORAMIC VIEWS,4.0,,"Cool ride in the air. Love it. The views are just awesome. Photo opportunities for Singapore's city skyline, harbor and Sentosa. The cable car provides a 360 degrees panoramic windows. I could say, the ride is a little bit short with a pricey tag ride. If not for the magnificent views, the ride would not be worth it. A glimpse of a cruise ship ""VIRGO"" added to the attraction. Overall, we had fun!"
,,Great View - Jewel Card a Great Value,5.0,,"I took my family to Singapore for five days to show them the wonders of this fabulous city.

Having been in Singapore many times over the past 23 years I carefully planned our itinerary for efficiency and enjoyment - mainly around my 3 year old grand daughter!

As we were planning on spending 1-2 days at Sentosa I thought one of the best ways to get there is via the Cable Car.

Most Singapore major attractions have online booking options to book and pay at a reduced rate.

The Singapore Cable Car offers the Jewel Card for $S 99 for a family of 4 for a year (S$ 39 for individuals).

When I compared the cost for the four of us to ride the cable car 2-4 times it became obvious that the Jewel Card was a much better option - especially since we plan to visit Singapore again within the next year.

I purchased the card online a week before our departure and since the confirmation indicated 4-6 weeks to process I was a bit concerned so I sent an email to them directly.

They graciously responded that our cards would be ready when we arrived. I truly appreciated they promptness of the reply and the effort to have our cards ready on short notice.

This is the most enjoyable way to travel to Sentosa and enjoy the view along the way!"
,,Cool ride,4.0,,Nice ride to Sentosa Island. Good view of the skyline. If you wait after 7pm to take the cable car there is a discount for the ride for 2 people which also includes 2 free sodas and popcorn.
,,the best way to get to Sentosa,4.0,,"If you don't suffer from fear of heights, try this way of getting to Sentosa Island. We went before noon on Sunday, expecting to queue for ever. But the place was deserted. It's a bit of a walk from the MIT station but there are signs everywhere (well, it's Singapore duh). For a few dollars you get your own little bubble and it takes you up, up, and away, over the cruise ship and ferry terminal and the inner harbour."
,,Nice view,5.0,,"Great view of Sentosa and surrounds, also passed over the Cruise Ship Virgo that was docked at the wharf. Very relaxing return trip from Mount Faber to Sentosa Island. it was a weekday no queues."
,,Nice but no cigar,3.0,,"This cable car ride was...average. It was OK, but basically the same as any other cable car ride. It did give a good view of the skyline but the line to get on was fairly long. Sentosa Island is interesting but nothing out of the ordinary like I expected. Guess I was hoping Singapore's attractions would be more ""Asian"" and not so Americanized or modern."
,,Nice view off the city and Sentosa,5.0,,This is a good way to get the full picture of Singapore and Sentosa. Nice and relaxing and a nice view.
,,One try you should not miss when visited This island,4.0,,"One place you must not miss when visit this island. Full view skyline view, beautiful hotel, sentosa's and many more"
,,Relax and enjoy,5.0,,My husband and I were in Singapore recently to visit our daughter and her husband. We loved the cable car! Leaving from Sentosa and up into the air with panoramic views all around. We got off at the Jewel Box on Mt. Faber and relaxed for almost an hour at the open air cafe with drinks and dessert which were included in the ticket price of SG$26. Took more photos from the observation deck and the gardens.
,,very good,5.0,,"the cable.car was very good I would recommend to everyone it is well worth the price and time to get on the cable car... The wait was not very long when I went on it.. The view was
very beautiful... and I would love to do it again..."
,,Lots of fun!!,5.0,,"Great views, what a fun way to visit Sentosa island in Singapore! Would do it again! A must at least once!"
,,Good way to travel with beautiful seaview scene,3.0,,"Pretty expensive, sgd 26 one way, but once in a while, this cable cable was not fully air cond and a bit warm in the cable car for 4 of us , two adult and two children below 12."
,,Scenic way to travel to Sentosa,4.0,,"Be treated to an awesome aerial view of Mount Faber and Sentosa on the cable car. Start your ride from Mount Faber, and you can also drop by The Jewel Box restaurant which has a balcony with an awesome view. I think it would be quite romantic up there at night! It's really quite fun riding on a cable car and I enjoyed it."
,,Phenomenal views from Mount Faber to Sentosa,5.0,,"Starting at Mount Faber and riding to Sentosa gave excellent views of the city. This was very enjoyable. It was amusing to see some people having dinners in the cable car, not sure how many loops around they give you but it might be worth it. Taking a rest in the restaurant for a drink after walking the southern ridges from Kent Ridge park was nice and the view was good."
,,Great way to get to Sentosa,5.0,,"The cable car ride from Mount Faber to Sentosa is well worth the time, effort and money. Excellent views of Sentosa, Singapore and the harbour area. A great way to get a feel for the geography of the area.
Would I recommend this attraction to family and friends? Most definitely."
,,You got to do it,5.0,,"It's 26 dollars round trip. It's worth the money and time and if you don't want to return with the cable car, take the ride all around anyway, to see Singapore and the passenger ship terminal from above. We had the chance to see a liner berthing, we passed right above her both on the way to Sentosa and back, when we could see the passengers dining.
I did not like the fact that all the exhaust smoke from ship's generators was coming right up to the cable car."
,,good experience,4.0,,i went with my family from sentosa island to the city & back to vivocity...nice scenic views of singapore flora & architecture! recommended even for ppl who are uncomfortable of heights as the capsule gives a really safe feeling...it seems tht dining facility also available ...will try next time!
,,Great start to a trip to Sentosa,4.0,,"We took a taxi from our hotel to the Mount Faber station and then took the cable car to Sentosa. This is a great way to start a day trip to Sentosa and you can purchase tickets for the attractions in Sentosa at the Mount Faber ticket office which can help you beat the queues when you want to visit places like Universal Studios. The cable car ride is smooth and gives fantastic views over Sentosa and the harbour. If you are returning to the city at the end of the day and using the cable car, it is a good idea to get off at the Harbour Front stop as it is easier to get an onward taxi there than at Mount Faber."
,,"Great way to enter Sentosa, fantastic views",4.0,,"Tis is not the cheapest way to go from the city to Sentosa, Burtis adds a lot to the experience of travelling to the island. Not busy, no waiting to get on in either direction when we went. Aquarium, Merlion, Universal are just a short walk from the station which was a quick transfer from the cable car. The cable car gave great view on the whole harbour and showed a lot of the port activity that is not so easily seen from the city. Well worth it for the views. Only issue is that if you need a taxi to return to the city from Mount Faber you may need to call one and wait a while."
,,Heights?....Who's Afraid....,4.0,,"We have been planning and wanting to ride the cable car to Sentosa Island. After a long back and forth subway ride, we finally made it to the mid-point of the cable car to Sentosa Island. I consider myself to be afraid of heights but when riding the cable car, I still felt that shortness of breath and hollow feeling inside but I had the peace of mind that it was safe. Due maybe because I started to trust how the subway and the streets being well maintained so I believe that the cable car has been maintained and checked to the high standard as well. We got off at Sentosa Island, upon leaving, we went all the way to the end and came back up the building at mid-point to catch the subway back to the hotel. We had fun riding the cable car, took lots of pictures and the memories will last for a long time."
,,Nice way to get to Sentosa,4.0,,"we took a taxi to Mount Faber and bought tickets on the Cable Car and since free coffee and cake (for the adults only) was included in the cost, we took up this offer at the Jewel Box restaurant on Mt Faber. The view is lovely and Mt Faber itself is so lush and green and the coffee and cake was very nice - would be nice to have a meal there. The Cable Car ride was not very long and as others have said, there was little air in the car and it was a hot day but it was bearable. My husband doesn't like heights but he was happy in the car and the kids enjoyed looking towards Sentosa Island with all its delights! This is a great way to get to Sentosa to see a different view of Singapore and is worth doing, just once at least. On the way back, we came in the evening to see the lights of Sentosa and Singapore and got off at Harbour Front Tower and caught the MRT back to near our hotel."
,,A very good experience,4.0,,"The views were wonderful as we could see the harbour, cruise ships and more. This ride is an alternative way to go to Sentosa. A must if you are in Singapore."
,,A little out there,4.0,,Only real drawback: no air conditioning. Not even a fan to ciculate the air. So if you don't like heat or heights not for you. It is a short trip. Worth doing once.
,,Fun For Young & Old to Get Bird Eye View Of Singapore & Sentosa,4.0,,It is a fun for every body irrespective of age specially if one is accompanied by kids and children who will make lot of noise in enjoyment during the ride .The journey in a secure cable car gives good view from the top of entire Singapore and Sentosa .I have done much more interesting and tough cable ride at Genting Height but it is also pleasurable . I did both ways as my hotel provided me complimentary ride pass two ways If you are visiting Sentosa from Singapore go by it or return by it .Going to Sentosa from Singapore will be a better idea as after getting down at Sentosa one can walk on road to enjoy beauty of island
,,Stunning views of the city!,4.0,,"We boarded the cable car at Harbourfront and bought a combo ticket for Universal Studios at Sentosa. The views from the cable car are stunning, staff are quick and efficient, but purchasing a ticket is a little slow. I found the tickets are quite expensive, especially for kids."
,,A fun way to get to Sentosa...,4.0,,"Used the cable car with my family to get to Sentosa from Mount Faber. My kids really enjoyed it and loved the unique experience. They thought it was impressive going over the large boats at the dock. It does go quite high so the views of the harbour and Sentosa Island itself are interesting. There was no line at all to get onto the car, the staff were lovely and helpful. We also bought tickets to the aquarium so were greeted at the other end by a tour guide and taken to the aquarium by the staff. Our tickets also included the trip back on the cable car, this time we hopped off at the Vivo city shopping centre and enjoyed a lovely dinner in the food court and a little look around before we returned to our hotel that evening. Thought the cable car was a great way to start and end the day at Sentosa."
,,Wonderful ride with amazing views,5.0,,"We as a family went on a ride on the Singapore Cable car last October. The views you see while on the ride is priceless. Especially the bird's eye view of the harbour front, sentosa island and the surroundings. The kids loved it a lot. For families visiting with kids, this is a fun ride to be in and a must do ride while in Singapore."
,,Great way to visit Sentosa,5.0,,"It is the excellent way to get to Sentosa and to enjoy great views at the same time. No queue. Very supportive personnel. Surely, it is cheaper to go by taxi. But we didn't regret about money)."
,,Great view with litle scary,4.0,,"Take a ride from Mount Faber, going to Sentosa Island, great view, but we take a ride with cloudy weather, great view to sentosa island and singapore, I suggest to take a ride at sunset. the cons, ticket is litle expensive. Overall Is good."
,,singapore cable car,5.0,,"it has newly renoveted in upgardeing and, was not that long of waiting time to get on it,it realy good for for those that do not like big crowded place with lot of nice people ........"
,,A great view!,5.0,,"Left my hotel and started to wander, next thing I knew I was in line to buy a ticket for the cable car and was on one the next moment. The cable car takes you from the harbour front centre, which is also shopping and the cruise ship docking, to the island of Sentosa. The view is amazing, albeit very high up, and the ride was smooth. I will definitely do it again on my next visit and I recommend this to others!"
,,Bird Sight View of Sentosa,5.0,,"If you want to see a bird sight view of Sentosa, Cable car is not to be miss. It's quite interesting and my family and I enjoy the ride. They have the angry bird theme then. Feel free to enjoy the ride. It's worth the money you pay"
,,A curate's egg - good in parts,3.0,,"First the good bits:
This cable car runs from Mount Faber Park via Harbourfront to Sentosa.
At Mount Faber there is a good restaurant (The Jewel Box) with lovely staff, amazing views & a great value cheap lunch offer.
Second the bad bits:
Our Singapore Stopover Package (page 35) stated ""Fly with us to Sentosa, Mount Faber and Harbourfront"" & offered a free 1-way cable car ride & directed us to Harbourfront to access the facility. What was not clear was that since Harbourfront is in the middle of the 2 destinations you can only get to one destination - hence we ended up at Mount Faber with the prospect of paying 40$+ just to get back to Harbourfront on the cable car! Solution - a taxi from just outside the Jewel Box will take you down to the MRT station for less than 7$."
,,Super Thrilling Experience,5.0,,"Hi every one,
Really Fantastic and thrilling experience for me.
The car was really good with black in color provided a screen inside it.
The car was up to sentosa with a total of 4 members.
The photographers near the cable car were taking every one pics when we were entering into cable car. After reaching the destination, we can see our pics. If they were good, we can pay them and we can get our pic.
We had really enjoyed a lot.I felt a bit scared at the very first moment because it was moving over the sea.
The view from cable car was really amazing and awesome.Very good experience for me travelling at greater heights.
We could find the total city view from our car.Really excellent views.I will upload some pics taken by me from our car.
Don't miss the cable car ride when you visit Singapore.
I expressed my feelings.
Its up to you to feel the experience of cable car."
,,Visit Just Before Sunset,4.0,,"Although this cable car is nothing like a cable car ride you will experience in the mountains, but it is unique in its own way. With amazing views of sentosa and the harbour, the best time to visit is just before sunset. They also have dinner plans making it a pretty good dating option!"
,,Got to go to Sentosa,5.0,,"You must not miss going up to the Cable Car and crossing to Sentosa Island. We did not have a day to spend at Sentosa but are so pleased that we made the effort to travel up to the Cable car and across to the island.

this cable car crosses through the middle of a skyscraper en route.

Truly an amazing experience !!! Do not miss this !!!"
,,"Marvelous experience, steep price.",5.0,,"This was the second time that we tried Sky Dining on the Cable Car in Singapore, having done it six years ago.

The experience is one that I would recommend as a 'must-do' for visitors to Singapore. The service is superb. You go three rounds from Mt. Faber to Sentosa Island and back.

The view is marvelous. You ride above one of the greenest areas in Singapore, then cross the waterfront above the quay where the cruise liners are berthed, then go across the water to Sentosa where you get a bird's-eye view of the resorts, casinos, etc. It's best to book a time just before dusk, so you get to see everything in daylight and then see the lights too.

The food quality is also excellent. Each course is served as you enter Mt. Faber on each round, with a steward clearing away the previous dishes. You get wine, welcome drink, soup, sorbet, main course, desert, etc. There are several menus at different prices.

A photographer takes snaps, and you can buy the prints and soft copies at the end of the trip.

There are also cable cars with floral interiors, at a higher price of course.

The price is rather steep though. Prices have certainly skyrocketed in six years!

I'd love to do it again. But I don't know if I will, because the price is very high now."
,,Scary but exciting,5.0,,"Was the teenagers' first time up high in a cable car. Were pretty nervous on the way up to Mt Faber. But once over the ocean, they were fine and relaxed enough the enjoy the scenic view."
,,Great view but can be very hot.,4.0,,"I have been on the cable car a couple of times, it's just a great thing to do with such a good view as you go to Sentosa and Mount Faber. With a lot of activity on the water you can get some good holiday snaps too. This attraction can get busy and it is worth having a think which way round you want to do your trip if you are doing the circle. My guess is that until the early evening, the main influx of passengers is over to Sentosa. Main problem if the cars have air conditioning you wouldn't know. it can be quite uncomfortable sometimes. Still worth a trip at least once."
,,Singapore Must Do!,5.0,,"Short ride but well worth it for the view and a different way to ride to Sentosa from Mount Faber. Nice view of Singapore from the gardens at the top before you set off as well.
One stop on the way at Harbourfront before the last leg over the sea itself....have been on the cable car several times, night time is interesting as well, also caught a storm on one occasion which added to the excitement but not for the faint hearted!"
,,would have scored a 5 but where is the air-con,4.0,,"I loved the views and the service and friendly staff and It is a must visit for any visitor.

Yes the cost is a bit high (especially) using only one way-- Sentosa to Harbourfront.

But we had some rain and the roof vents were closed off.

Gee, I thought i was going to pass out.

It was SO hot, humid and sticky with not a breath of air moving around inside the car.

Come on Guys, we are like """"inches"""" from the Equater air cond should be a must."
,,"Not too long, not too short, great views of city",4.0,,"I have been on the Hong Kong Ngong Ping Cable car ride--a breathtaking experience-- which scared the living daylights out of my senior citizen parents. Also, I have been on the Kuranda Skyrail cable car ride in Cairns, Australia which also frightened my senior citizen parents. But we found this cable car ride just right for them. This ride starts in Mount Faber and lands in Sentosa Island in a friendly angle, going straight through a high rise building in the middle of the journey. So it's not too long and not too short of a trip, rewarding the riders with excellent views of the city. I highly recommend it for all visitors to Singapore. (I went there just last weekend.)"
,,Awesome,5.0,,It is beautiful experience specially in the night when lights are on gives a birds eye view of things around
,,Its a good experience for kids,4.0,,But too steep for the experience. One way trip is about 20odd sing dollars. It takes you into sentosa island. another way to get into Sentosa. thats it.
,,Great way to get to Sentosa,5.0,,"We used the cable car to get to Sentosa and back on a day visit. No line up, straight into a car and across. Fantastic views of Singapore, Sentosa and the bay. There are a few options to get across but this is enjoyable and certainly recommended. The cable car museum on Sentosa is well worth the look too."
,,comfort and nice view,4.0,,"As long as you get on it feel safe, I mean not like the other shake it swing left and right when the wind come.
It quit expensive and it have 2 stop. Most of the people will get off when the first stop cos the staff never tell can continue to the end!!! So if you get off show them the ticket you can get on again. So I will suggest you get on until the end (don't get off the 1st stop stay in) walk around have alook Singapore view then get on again back to the 1st stop, cos the end stop you can't get any transport back to the city(no bus, taxi you will wait for ages ).
Enjoy your cable trip , very nice view anyway. Just the staff not really helpful but forget about them you still enjoy it."
,,Fourty minutes queue for tickets...,1.0,,"Cable car ride awesome, but to let customers wait for a short but very expensive ride for more than half an hour to purchase tickets is very un-Singaporean. Saturday just before noon, only two desks open out of six. Singapore, pull up your socks, it is not only money, try the old service again!"
,,nice ride,4.0,,"its a nice ride up to the mountain and also to sentosa. ok, its a bit pricy (round trip 28 SGD), but u get nice views over singapore. my advice is to go to sentosa first during daytime and then to mount faver for sunset."
,,Great views over to Santosa,5.0,,"This is the only way to get to Santosa, make sure you buy a package and you get priority loading and a tour showing you around when you get over there. Great views of the area and goes straight over cruise ships for a close up view."
,,Bit disappointing - short distance,3.0,,This was the first cable car i had been on in my life around 6 years back so was looking forward to it. Since then had been on quite a few other cable cars too with more unique views hence the slight disappointment. The walk from Harbourfront MRT to the boarding point was quite a bit for old people. We went as a big family group and used the 50% off scheme else cable car seemed bit expensive. The car itself moves really slow so can easily take snaps and enjoy the view of sentosa. Additionally its really steady and doesnt make noises either which was great. Its nice to do once to enjoy the view.
,,The views!,4.0,,It's a little on the high side $$ but the views on the clear day we visited were wonderful - lots of oohs and ahhs from the kids!
,,The one and only cable car ride in Singapore,5.0,,"It used to be an alternative means to visit Sentoas, now the iconic Mt Faber serves fine dining and a great place to chill out and enjoy the scenary of Singapore south. The cable car rides provide a good birds eye view of the harbour front and Sentosa."
,,"Not so good, far from bad.",3.0,,"The ride is a bit fast. But you can see a good aerial view of the Sentosa, the nearby port and some skyline. The regular cabin is not airconditioned so expect a bit humid room especially when riding around 10am till early afternoon."
,,Cable car,5.0,,"This is a must if and when you visit the Island of Singapore .The trip is fantastic and eye watering but if you do not like heights don't indulge' when we went it started to rain heavily and the wind got up and we were swaying a lot but we knew we were safe as houses. When we arrived at the top the view was brilliant this is something you should never miss. You will never forget the trip of a lifetime.

I was born here and re visited all my old haunts and had a wondeful time.Dip your toe in this wonderful Island."
,,Gorgeous Night Views,4.0,,"A friend and I took the Singapore Cable Car from the main terminal to Sentosa Island in the evening (while on an overnight stopover from Australia to Cambodia.) We paid a discounted rate for the evening's travel, leaving the main terminal after 7 or 7:30pm, and were able to stay on the island for about 2 hours exploring before catching the cable car back. The night views were beautiful, and the lines nonexistent, making it a great way to spend and evening in Singapore!"
,,good views,4.0,,go from the top and get the best views of Singapore to Sentosa across the water. Good to do at least once
,,Lunch at the top!,5.0,,"Great food in the restaurant at the top, take as long as you like to absorb the view and then down to the entertainment of Sentosa. An excellent experience for all."
,,A spectacular view,4.0,,"The ride was good especially my kids loved it. The view was spectacular as we could see harbour of Singapore, cruise ships and all. As you near Adventure Cove exit, you can see doplhins swimming and splashing in the water. It is good ride for kids to enjoy!"
,,Great experience with a lovely view but a little pricey,4.0,,"We took the cable car from Mount Faber to Sentosa. We really enjoyed the experience although it only took about 10-15 minutes. We took the cable car about 9.30am and there was no queue at all. The view is stunning even on a cloudy day and it was a novelty to experience a cable car ride for the first time.

If you are afraid of heights this may not be suitable. The only reason i am not giving this 5 out of 5 is because it was very expensive indeed for what it was and we were not given the option of a one way ticket which was disappointing- we took the monorail back as it was a more straight forward way to get back to the harbourfront."
,,"a little bit tacky, but good view over the harbour and attentive staff",4.0,,"The ride from Mount Faber to Sentosa gives you an overview of the huge commercial harbour of Singapore and also shows how ugly and commercial Sentosa has become - a Disneyland of bad taste. This said the gondolas are latest generation (they change them each coupel of years), but the angry birds theme looks a little bit tacky.

There is as small but interesting cable car museum at the Sentoaa terminal included in the ticket price.

Operations are well managed at a point that when a member of my party left his small camera bag behing on the onward ride and asked for it upon his return, the staff had it ready to give it back with a smile. That is attentive service.

The ride itself is expensive like everything in Singaore."
,,A must on your list!,4.0,,"I have done this 3 times in less than 3 months with my various visitors & I am scared of Heights!!
It isn't that expensive, make sure you ask for just a single adult ticket either a round trip or sentosa return. The ticket office does not have a sign up advertising this, but has many confusing package options. The website is more user friendly.
Overall, I really like it, it's a nice way to see a bit of Singapore & Sentosa."
,,Fabulous views,5.0,,"This is an experience in its own right although we were using it to visit Sentosa. There are three stations and it is possible to get off at all three. One, where it is normal to join the flyer is on the 15th floor of an office building near the cruise harbour, the second is on Sentosa Island and the third at the top is a small shop and a Restaurant but worth a visit for the higher views. A simple round trip is possible just for the ride and the views are spectacular. Not cheap at just over 25$singapore but in hindsight worth it."
,,What a rip off!,1.0,,"Looked everywhere on their website to find out how much the short ride from Harbourfront to Mount Faber was and all they had was the entire ride to Sentosa. Got to Harbourfront and was put off by the long queue. So walked up to Mount Faber to have lunch. On the way back, we decided to take the cable car back to Harbourfront. Asked at the ticket booth and was told one way or return same price $26. Get off at Harbourfront or Sentosa also same price $26. Why don't they be more upfront with such information and state this fact on their website? Unfortunately, this is the typical unyielding, inflexible system that is rife in this country. It seems that what the consumers want matters absolute squat to these people. Nice way to run a tourist attraction!"
,,Great Views...,4.0,,The Singapore Cable Car ride is an awesome experience!! Great view of the city all the way to Sentosa...My daughter loved the angry birds cable car...Its cheaper to take return tickets than one way...One can enjoy the views during the day as well as in the night after spending the day at Sentosa...Only suggestion is too make the one way ticket little cheaper!!
,,Awesome views,5.0,,"We had a free ride as part of a stopover package and loved it!
Birds eye view over Singapore and Sentosa make a perfect background for nice photos to show back home :)"
,,Good view however overpriced,3.0,,We did the cable car as my daughter loves them. It is a smooth operation however overpriced. Should provide a 1 way option. Also the electric doors at the ticket office are not good when there is a queue. Would not revisit.
,,Great view from the top,4.0,,"The kids loved the angry birds cable car, awesome view esp the dolpin park! we brought the jewel pass (one year) that gives us unlimited rides and discounts at Sentosa. I would highly recommend it to my overseas friends (though i find it a bit pricey)."
,,to sentosa,5.0,,first try to Sentosa with family it was a nice ride though it was a little frightening due to the elevation it was travelling. Otherwise it is safe to ride them

,,to sentosa,5.0,,first try to Sentosa with family it was a nice ride though it was a little frightening due to the elevation it was travelling. Otherwise it is safe to ride them
,,Awesome!!,5.0,,This has got its own experience. They have facility to wine and dine in the cable car. You shud go in the night to see the colorful view of singapore from Top
,,Superb views!,5.0,,"The views from the cable car were spectacular! During the ride to Sentosa, we soared pass large cruise liners and got a bird's eye view of Universal Studios Singapore, the water themed park, the yet to be opened to public, dolphins and a lovely sunset. It was really a unique and fun way to get to Sentosa. We enjoyed much savings from the ongoing 50% discount too!"
,,It's a good experience,4.0,,"It's a good experience to have a view of the new RWS and Universal Studio and a bird eye view of sentosa island, and a little of the sentosa golf course as well. Quite good if you're not afraid of heights!"
,,Singapore Cable Car,5.0,,Awesome - you could see for miles and as for travelling over the top of two ocean liners- that was a first!
,,Great way to get to Sentosa,5.0,,"We wanted to go to Sentosa for the day and decided to take the Cable Car.
We started at Harbour Point and took the cable car up to Mt Faber...there is a shop and a couple of restaurants. We stopped for a sandwich lunch for $8 SD which is the cheapest we found in Singapore! We were also lucky enough to see the Air Show which was flying over Sentosa.
After dragging ourselves away, we took the cable car to Sentosa. The views were worth it.
A few hours walking round Sentosa, and we took the cable car back to Harbour Point. $29 SD well spent and not an Angry Bird to be heard - luckily!"
,,Best way to Sentosa,4.0,,A much more pleasant way to get to Sentosa island than the train. The views are amazing and the Angry Birds theme is entertaining (although the theme music played on a loop in the cable cars can get a bit old)
,,It's just a cable car,3.0,,"Once is enough.

This ride will give a you good view of Singapore and Sentosa, over Sentosa you'll see the pools of Resorts World then you'll say you wish you there.

I tried the Ngong Ping 360 in Hong Kong, so I guess this cable car is ordinary. The smaller kids would love the Angry Bird cars though. Nice touch."
,,Awesome ride!,5.0,,"What a view from Mount Faber to Sentosa Island! Started from Mount Faber and ended on Sentosa Island in about 20 minutes or so. Lost track of time looking at the Island, the ships in the harbour and the sorounding area. Got the tickets discounted on Groupon SG so keep an eye out! Was great for our little guy! He was so excited to have the Angry Birds in the car with us! Great Marketing tool!"
,,Cable car in Singapore,5.0,,"This was a gorgeous view of Singapore from the air. Once at the top, we were able to look out over the Harbor and the city. The breeze from that high up was such a relief from the heat of Singapore."
,,Great views but expensive,3.0,,"Cable car goes from Sentosa to Harbour front and then on to Mount Faber. A 15 minute journey in total. Cost around 29 SGD per person which is expensive for such a short journey.
Absolutely nothing at Mount Faber except for an expensive an unintesting restaurant.
Try to terminate your ride at Harbour Front, where you will find a shopping mall called Vivo City. They have a great food court where the meals are very good value for money.
This ride is definitely not worth the money."
,,Amazing views,5.0,,Worth trying this not to expensive and you can get off on sentosa explore the island and get back on and carry on right to the top . Views are amazing
,,Singapore cable car to Sentosa Island,5.0,,"Very good- trip over to Sentosa Island. Excellent views over the island. The Island itself has a lot to offer families, could spend a day or have a holiday on the Island."
,,High flying,4.0,,We caught the cable car from Harbourfront to Sentosa then back to Mt Faber. Great views abound and it provided a nice sedate trip across land and water. Worth doing at least once if you're foot weary.
,,Spectacular,4.0,,Nice ride down the faber park to Sentosa island. Good sights especially esrly rvening hours. You have a chance of passing above ocean cruise giant ships that are sometemies docked in the harbour. Worth doing once.
,,Not worth it,2.0,,The price is to high compare the view. The ride is short and what more to write. Compare with the cable car in Taipei this here is nothing so no more visit here.
,,"What's up with Singapore and ""Angry Birds""?",3.0,,"Well, if you are not used to riding cable car, it is a nice ride. But the view is just OK. If you want to see Singapore from above, there are much better options for that. And the angry bird theme? Please...who wants to listen to a theme song for a stupid mobile game while watching wonderful Singapore from above? It looks like angry birds is all over the island, even at terminal 3 at changi:) A little bit expensive ride, but people seems willing to pay that amount for it. So the price stays."
,,Good way to see south of Singapore in aerial view while getting into Sentosa,4.0,,"As in title, just that the ride is rather short.Good way to see south of Singapore in aerial view while getting into Sentosa..."
,,not worth it,2.0,,"I payed 29 SGD for a round trip with cable car to Santosa Island
I belive the trip is not wort it as not much to see on Santosa Island (except if you have kids) . Each ride costs around 20 SGD therfore is quite expensive."
,,Great Views but overpriced,4.0,,"This is a great way to see the City and harbour and it is a good ride. You can board at three points but It’s just too expensive for what you get. At Mount Faber there is nothing much to see or do and the Jewel Box is a bunch of bunch of pricey fancy restaurants and it is beyond me why anyone would come all this way to them when there are better ones in Town. If you are just going to Sentosa Island take the cheaper monorail which is fast and frequent. There are high rides on Santosa where you will see quite a bit of the views you get from the cable car although, I admit, not so good. The TV in the cars is distracting and puerile. It is some kind of angry bird although its relevance is very obscure. Far better would be a commentary of the view."
,,Nothing so special about this...,3.0,,"This is probably one of the average attractions in Singapore, if you never been to a cable car before, you can give it a try otherwise its just a regular cable car journey. If you are a photo enthusiastic then you may get some nice snaps of the marina and also the beach from top."
,,Amazing view,4.0,,"Definitely use the cable car if you are heading to Sentosa Island as the view is amazing. If you can, pre book tickets as there was quite a long view. Taxis dont come very often to the entrance at the Jewel Box to take you back home but there is a SGD$1 bus that will take you to a bus terminal and you can get home from there."
,,Not worth the time and money,2.0,,"Out of all the attractions in Singapore, this shouldn't make the top 50 list. It's expensive, it has almost no views and takes you to Mount Faber which barely has anything to show and is packed with expensive restaurants. Comparing this to other cable cars in the region (like Hong Kong) or the views you get from the Marina Bay Sands Hotel platform, this cable car ride makes no sense.
Unless you or your kids get any kicks from the Angry Birds theme, stay away from this ""attraction""."
,,Nothing special,2.0,,The ride is short. The angry birds theme rather appalling. When you arrive at Mount Faber there is not much to see and do. We wanted to have a drink at the Bistro but the service was terrible and the bottle of beer we got looked like ages old... The only interesting thing was the view of the huge container harbor on the way to Sentosa. If you don't have excessively time don't bother.
,,Take this instead of other high-view attractions at Sentosa,4.0,,"The cable car was stable, great view from above. There are two starting points, I took the second one from Harbour-Vivo City and that was apparently less people than the one in the first starting point. If you dont have much time in Sentosa, I'd suggest take cable car but no need to take other attractions that will take you up high to see the view, because you'll see the same view anyway.

Watch your package vouchers / daily pass that you may have bought days before. It may not include the cable car price for $ 29 (back and forth) per person. I met 2 families that they already went up to 15th floor of Harbour-Vivo City building to start riding the cable car while actually their vouchers do not include the cable car ticket hence they had to go back to the first floor and queue."
,,Nice Views,4.0,,"We took the Cable car to sentosa island and after we were done, we took it back for the full ride. It's really nice."
,,Face your fears,4.0,,"Its great ,you can see evrywhere,its scarey,its so high up ,I went with the angry bird in our cable car ,The ride was smooth and easy the view outstanding, a must do,it goes for about 45 minutes across to Sentosa,I never thought I would do it,i'm glad I did."
,,"nice views of the bay, annoying Angry Birds promo in Dec",4.0,,"My bf was pretty eager to ride the cable car during the day so as to take better photos of the view, but we couldn't fit it into our already packed itinerary, so we ended up taking it back at night. Good thing though, because we got the Adult Promotion Entry Pass, SG Cable Car - Night Rider for only $39 for 2 people! Included an Angry Birds popcorn and a free gift if we went to The Jewel Box.

The view overlooking all the twinkly lights over the bay was quite nice. Unfortunately, our cameras didn't take very good night shots, so we had to try to enjoy the view with our eyes only. The annoying Angry Birds song was playing on a small flat-screen in the cable car.

I wasn't super in awe of the cable car, as I've ridden plenty of them in Switzerland, but what did amaze me was how we got the whole cable car to ourselves instead of having to share with other riders. That was nice. The car could have easily fit 8 peeps.

We got off at HarbourFront and actually exited the building, completely forgetting about our gift, and then I realized and made my tired and hungry bf go back in to get the gift. So we got back in the cable car, went to Mount Faber, and discovered that The Jewel Box was nothing more than a bunch of fancy restaurants that we would not be patronizing. If this was Mount Faber Leisure Group's way of directing traffic there, then it didn't make any sense at all, because sweaty, casually dressed tourists would not be entering a fancy restaurant for dinner. Plus, the ""free gift"" was just some apple juice in a plastic sippy cup. Angry Birds-themed again. So lame.

I wanted to bring the cups back to Switzerland, just because we went through so much trouble to get them, but alas, they did not fit into our small luggage, so we left them at the hotel for hopefully someone else to enjoy.

So all-in-all, we rode the cable car three times and got: one plain one, one decked out with fake flower garlands, and one with Angry Birds design on the bench and also a huge (and somewhat dirty-looking) plush doll on the seat.

I'm not sure if the Angry Birds promotion helped or hindered the whole experience. I thought it was cute, but a bit commercial"
,,Trip with the cablecar,4.0,,"It was a great trip. We had a beautiful sight. We recommend this trip. Last time when we were here we couldn't take the cablecar,because it was broken. Now the experience was great. We enjoy the view."
,,Great view if nothing else.,4.0,,"The whole angry birds thing was a bit OTT for me, but it was great just to do a round trip and see the views. Did it during the day, would go back at night for a different perspective. Spectacular scenery, no need to get off at either end."
,,Great!,4.0,,This is the best way to get in Sentosa! great view at night! highly recommended! The only thing is the music of the angry bird there is too loud which disturb the ambience of the journey.
,,An aerial view of Singapore port!,4.0,,"We had visitors and decided to take them on a cable car ride to sentosa and back. It was worth it. Cost about S$29. We took the cable car from mount faber and then stop in sentosa, went to the marine life park and then took the cable car back to vivio city to do shopping. So it was altogether an excellent plan. The ride was fast but we were able to get good photos on good day.
We saw a crusie ship from the top view so it was great!
We prefer to have a car to ourselves but when you have other people in the same car, you tend not to enjoy as much cos you do not want to offend anyone. So we hope the management can understand this.

Some folks have body odour and can be really miserable if you have them in your car...;( Please help make the cable car a pleasant ride.
Some folks talk very loud and to us, it can be unbearable !

We hope they can respect that tourists may want to have a good memorable trip!"
,,nice view but pricey,3.0,,"before 7pm the ticket priced at 29 dollars a person. offering fantastic view of RWS and also Sentosa. try a ride after 7pm, night breeze is cool. may wanna try the 4 course dinner in the air next time :)"
,,nice view,4.0,,"nice view, nice experience. We really liked that you get your 'own' cabin...so they take care that you can enjoy your ride (we went during the week). It was worth the money, a nice posibility to have a different view on the city and go to Mt Faber and Sentosa"
,,Not a great deal to see from up here,3.0,,"Went with wife and 2 kids on 21 dec 2012, cost approx 100 Singapore dollars. Not a great deal to see but if you are on holiday in Singapore you have to fill your time so you will probably want to go. Note, if you are going to spend time on sentosa island then the cable car ride is included in the 1 day sentosa play pass which I think cost about 200 Singapore dollars for the 4 of us and allows you to go on most of the attractions on sentosa (excluding universal studios). If you are not going to sentosa then I reckon the Singapore flyer is better value (30 mins ride as opposed to 15 mins on cable car)."
,,Happy Snaps,4.0,,It takes around 30 minutes to do a round trip provided you don't hop off at one of the stops. Good views for happy snaps
,,Birthday Surprise,4.0,,"My wife had booked a special dining package to surprise me on my birthday. The 90 minute long cable car ride during the twilight hours of the evening were in a word, spectacular!
The delectable three course meal coupled with the stunning views of the Singapore skyline and harbour made the experience unforgettable! The friendly service and the hospitality shown by the staff was another plus.
Apart from the special packages, the cable car trip is a unique experience and best enjoyed with friends and family. A must do when visiting Singapore."
,,Expensive short ride,3.0,,It's an expensive ride for a lot of money. We thought it might be worthwhile to at least take some pictures from the cable car. But it was really too short and the scenery is really not that great compared to many other cable car rides around the world.
,,Great way to see Singapore,4.0,,Nice ways to see Singapore .take photographs and cameras with you to film this great ride. Just relax and enjoy it. We take the bus from sentosa to take us to the cable car and then to a shoping mall ( or near).
,,Cable Car,3.0,,It was a pleasant ride. But you can't always see with people moving around the car. You get a much better view of Sinapore from the Flyer but you get a good view of Sentosa Island from the Cable Car.
,,Best ride from city to sentosa,5.0,,"Cable car ride is amazing when u going back from sentosa, it gives u a magnificent view of sentosa and city. We were lucky there was a cruise ship sailing from there , the ships look awesome from above !!!"
,,Views of the City,4.0,,The cable car trip was well worth the visit. Views from the city to Sentosa island were impressive. We were lucky enough to view the fireworks in the harbor from our car and I would suggest that users try to ensure that there trip coincides with that too.
,,Grandson rates it as great.,3.0,,"Our 4 year old grandson is crazy about ""Angry Birds"". When we were in Singapore the cable car to Sentosa had a temporary Angry Birds theme, so we had to take the ride. The view was great. He enjoyed it very much so I guess I would recommend the ride to all travelling with young children. The buses on Sentosa are free so you can get around the island easily. Personally I preferred Sentosa as it was 40 years ago! However if you like theme parks you will like it."
,,Not bad but not great either,2.0,,"I read in another review on Trip Advisor that the Cable Car offers better views and value than the Flyer but after trying both, my personal preference is the Flyer (if you're going to choose just one). The views from the Cable Car are beautiful, and the attraction is clean and well run. The down side for me was that the ride is very short and there isn't a map provided to help you understand what you're looking at. Plus, you get the same views from the top of the mountain, so you can save some money and just take a taxi or bus to the top.

If you decide to check out this attraction and you're a local, the year pass offers the best value. For just $9 more than the cost of a single round-trip ride you get unlimited Cable Car rides, access to Sentosa and a 20% discount when you buy a ride pass for a friend/visitor."
,,Worth riding,5.0,,A good and enjoyable way to go to the area across water although other options like taxi and bus service is available.The children in particular enjoy this and remember for long time till they see something better.
,,Good option for a view,4.0,,"We had wanted to have a sky view at least once while in Singapore and we selected the Cable Car and have no regrets. I think of all the options this one was definitely the best for us. They had a Angry Birds promotion on while we were there which was a bit of fun, our cable cars had large plush angry birds in them.

We got on in the middle and first headed to the Jewel Box, nice views over an area of forest, we then headed over to Santosa. We got to go over a big cruise ship, view the extravagance of Santosa, with the dolphins, man made reef for snorkeling and the massive Merlion. You could also see the big cargo ships.

It didn't have a great view of the city centre, it was in the distance to the side, but I actually think the best view of the CBD is from the Marina Bay Sands area. Was certainly the best view option in Singapore for us."
,,Nice view of the container port and Sentosa,4.0,,"This is probably the best way to visit Sentosa Island and also get a great view of the surrounding area.

What I didn't like and a mistake, was buying our attraction tickets at the cable car station. These are not valid at the attractions, so you have to queue again and exchange them for new tickets at each venue.

And finally, what I didn't like was how they had set up a lap-top at the cable car exit and offering a ""present"" for writing a trip advisor review! So, I expect a lot of very positive reviews.

At the end of the day, it's a cable car, no different than many others I have been on."
,,Amazing view over Harbour Front,5.0,,"We did the cable car ride at night and I can say ""awesome views"" I would definitely recommend it & didn't have to wait for the tickets as it was after 7 - brilliant! Going again tomorrow before we leave."
,,Fabulous way to access Sentosa. The views are amazing.,5.0,,We went on this while they had an angry birds promotion which the kids thought was awesome our carriage was decorated with a plush angry bird toy and painted out in angry birds and a video played on the screen inside. My son was in heaven. The views are incredible. We found the whole thing seamless the staff were helpful and polite. The photo they took at the start was actually excellent and for $20 we got it in an angry birds folder and the electronic version which I thought was ok.
,,So so,5.0,,"I wouldn't recommend riding this cable car, as it is an expensive trip and it's better to go on the Singapore Flyer! Probably it's because I had seen the cable car in Hong Kong before..and it's the longest in the world.
There is a cheaper way to get to Sentosa- metro. It is much cheaper."
,,"Badly organised, badly managed and poor value",2.0,,"The Singapore cable car has a great product - a scenic cable car from wooded Mount Faber through Harbour Front to Sentosa, but the management and pricing of the attraction is disappointing. The whole experience is set up to maximise revenue rather than any focus on the customer experience or customer satisfaction. For example:

Why is there no automated ticketing? How hard is it to sell tickets from a machine instead of making people stand in line? Instead, you have to stand in a long queue to purchase ticket seemingly sold by under-motivated, slow staff, whose numbers seem disproportionate to their productivity. Three staff members today and only one till open. The staff exist only to try to sell confusing packages. The woman in front of me was told it would be cheaper for her to buy a ticket for her three year old who was technically free because then she would benefit from an even bigger discount than if she bought the tickets separately. The ticket prices and ticket selling are a joke process designed to confuse customers and distract them from the high prices being charged.

Why can't they sell one way tickets? We were three adults and three children who wanted to take the cable car one way from Mount Faber to Harbour Front. We had completed a hike and needed to get down from the hill. But you can't buy one way tickets, or you can, but the return ticket is the same price. Instead we paid $99 for various packages and promotions which featured Angry Birds drinks and masks, and probably the full trip to Sentosa and back. I felt completely ripped off and angry at having waited ten minutes to be gouged. The Singapore residents in the queue in front felt the same as they spent a good ten minutes like us trying to work out what package they were being sold and arguing at the nonsensical muddle that is the sales process.

You're running a cable car which goes from A to B to C. Not difficult to organise one way tickets and ride only fares surely? But not if your objective is to rip off the punters.

Summary: I enjoyed the ride in the cable car, I didn't enjoy being taken for a ride by the management."
,,A different perspective,4.0,,"This was great with the kids. Short enough to maintain their attention, but long enough to get some good views of Singapore.

Cost was pretty reasonable by Singapore standards and there was no wait for a car.

On Sentosa there's heaps to do - you're spoilt for choice.

The only slight negative is that you have to find your way from inside one shopping mall to outside to another building.
The mall is on the MRT line so makes accessing it easy."
,,Great view,4.0,,We took that from Vivocity to Sentosa Island.Must experience the great view.Really a nice experience.
,,Take cable car for Sentosa,5.0,,"View of Singapore port, bay area and surrounding buildings was fantastic. They have tied-up with Angry Bird franchisee and firstly take visitors to their restaurant & a souvenir shop located on the opposite-end which may be avoided. And if you are planning your return journey also by cable-car itself, do take the car before closing-time 930 pm."
,,Birthday Treat,4.0,,"Brought my daughter for a ride when she turned 6. Thought she would be a little scared but she LOVED it! She loved how you feel like a fairy, flying over everything!"
,,A Must in Singapore,5.0,,"At first I was not sure whether to go for it or not.
Decided to give it a try taking evening pass shich starts at 6pm includes any three option in Santosa at half the price.
Glad that We went for it and it was an amazing experience. both Views while going up the hill to Mt Faber and crossing Sea to santosa are amazing.
This should not be missed."
,,easy scenic ride to Sentosa,4.0,,"We took the cable car to get to Sentosa Island. Easy to reach via Bus, MRT or Taxi. Fare includes entrance fee to the Island.

They make a big thing about the ""First Angry Bird"" ride, .... well, having a big toy sitting in the corner and that typical game sounds out of the speaker with a cartoon running on the TV in the cabin did not trigger my excitement.

The view from the cable car is great, so so need for that angry bird nonsense... it is rather distracting. However, it is a great short ride day or nighttime and for me the preferred option to get to Sentosa Island.

I loved the ""rules of use""-board, which mention that it is not allowed to throw noisy kids out of the cabin :-)"
,,Good views on a clear day,4.0,,Travels between Mt Faber and Sentosa. On a clear day it has great views but is a little pricey so not worth it on an overcast day.
,,Great views,4.0,,"The views over the bay are lovely. Its just a 10 minute ride, a little warm as the cars aren't air conditioned, but well worth doing."
,,Cable car ride is a must,4.0,,"If you like heights then this won't be a problem. It is a relaxed way to travel to Sentosa Island. It's a bit hot in the cars, but....you forget all of that because of the vista that surrounds you."
,,Great Views,5.0,,"We went on the cable car to Mt Faber & return. Great views from the car & a different way to get to Mt Faber where we had a light lunch enjoyed some lovely views & refreshing breezes. The cars are all well enclosed safe & solid for those who may worry about heights---namely me.

It was a good fun experience & added something else to do in a city that is full of good experiences. Gotta love Singapore!"
,,view from the top,3.0,,"you can see the singapore , sentosa and singapore port from the cable car. view is nice from the top. everyone can enjoy the view from top. night view is excellant also."
,,Good ride with great views,4.0,,"The cable car connects the Singapore mainland to Sentosa island. This is one of the means to reach Sentosa and offers great panoramic view of the city. We did not do the ride both ways and took only the ride from mainland to Sentosa. One can appreciate the sheer height at which these cable cars are operated. It would be a bit of scary proportion for people who have fear of heights.

The ride approximately takes around 10-15mins. If one is planning to visit Sentosa, one should try this approach atleast one way."
,,High As,5.0,,"Locked in a little glass bubble with open windows starts off a bit scarey. But the view from up here, and it is high up, is just so cool. So much to see on way to Sentosa Island. Would recommend this to all, even if you are not that flash on heights."
,,cable car experience,5.0,,"The first time I rode the cable car, I was alone. It was fun but visiting the cable car with the family proved to be more enjoyable and memorable. They gave Angry Birds mask to each one of us. You'll see the beauty of Mt. Faber and the harbor during the ride. The kid and the kids-at-heart really enjoyed it!"
,,Excellent Diwali vacation,5.0,,We have enjoyed excellent ride of Singapore cable car with beautiful view of Singapore. Ride of 8 min take you to the haven. Best view of all around. Nice service
,,I thought it would be scary....but it was great,5.0,,Great fun and not as expensive as I thought it might be. Easy to find and one can choose where to get off. You can go from Mount Faber (a bit harder to get to by public transport but taxis abound) or Harbourfront doing either a round trip or alighting on Sentosa Island where there is loads to do - including a lot of family orientated activity.
,,Fun and great views - but somewhat pricy,4.0,,This is a great way to go to Mount Faber. From Sentosa to the Keppel towers you have great views of the harbour. When approaching Mount Faber you have great view of the impressive rain forest canopy.
,,Fun for all ages,5.0,,"The cable car is a must do even on a short visit. It is easy to reach on the MRT and well signposted. Use a Singapore Airlines boarding pass stub to receive 15% discount. Angry Birds are flying the cables cars at the moment so if the kids are into that they will love it, the cars are decorated as birds and pigs! The ride on a clear day is great so take the weather into account. We got off at Sentosa then hopped on the Island bus and did a tour then went back over. This is enough if you do not want to do the themepark."
,,Great views of Sentosa Island,4.0,,"Catch the cable car for great views of Sentosa World Resort, Sentosa Island, harbour front and city skyline. Its 1,650m long and stands between 60 and 80m off the ground. We caught the ride from Imbiah Station on Sentosa Island over the water to the harbour front, through a high rise building and over to Mt Faber. Had lunch in one of restaurants there and then caught the ride back to Sentosa."
,,A bird's eye view on the way to Sentosa,3.0,,"The cable car ride affords the opportuntity to see Singapore from the air. The view of the water is great leading to Sentosa. It is a different way to get to Sentosa and it certainly brings into view all that is commercial and 'theme park' about Sentosa. It had been many years since taking this trip and while theme parks are great family days out, for me Sentosa had lost a lot of its earlier charm. Not for the fainthearted who are scared of heights."
,,Had a nice journer,5.0,,"Irrespective of the time constrain I had, I decided to try the cable car and it was a nice experience. Had a very nice experience. Good views.."
,,"Most fun, but not the cheapest way into Sentosa Island",4.0,,"Rather than take a bus or the Sentosa Express Monorail (a tiny version of Singapore's MRT), this is the scenic route. The basic package is S $29 for a round trip, and if the weather's good, you'll get really spectacular views. The return trip in the late afternoon or evening after a day on Sentosa is even better. You either get a great sunset or the lights of the city & ships below.

If you have a limited budget (or just don't want to spend that much) and have to chose between spending around 30 something singapore dollars on either the Singapore Flyer or a round trip Singapore Cable Car ride, I'd recommend to go for the Cable Car. The ticket price already includes admission to the island as well as unlimited rides on the Sentosa Express Monorail (just don't exit at Vivo City Mall or you'll have to pay to get back into Sentosa). With the Flyer on the other hand, you just get in a large room (capsule) and you stand there gawking for around half an hour.

Reconsider taking this ride if you're afraid of heights or suffer from vertigo."
,,It's a cable car...,3.0,,"...and the view is a lot of office blocks, a bit of water and you're there. Nto Cape Town or the Alps - a taxi si quicker and less hassle."
,,Fantabulous,5.0,,"Very amaising engineering to transport tourists from mainland Singapore to Santosa Island. The Cable Car ride is overwelheming first out of the station, but you tend to forget about the height and look around taking in the 360 degree view. Well worth the price of the trip"
,,Fun Ride,5.0,,"Lovely ride and Soothing panoramic view of Singapore from cable car, but is is bit overpriced.Singapore, the Cable Car is a must-see."
,,Enjoyable Ride,5.0,,"It's been a long time since we took the cable car. So when my friends suggested that we take this iconic attraction to Sentosa, we were all up for it. We took the night rider package.The view was fantastic! I think I will bring my girlfriend to this attraction next week."
,,"Overrated, overpriced, but great views. :)",3.0,,"We took the very last cable car ride for the evening (""only"" 20SGD), and we were told not to get off the cable car on Sentosa island, but rather come straight back, or we'll have to come back by taxi.
Well, for 20 SGD it was a short ride (10 minute all the way to Sentosa island and back), but the view was amazing, both of the city and of Sentosa island."
,,Fun for the family,5.0,,We all like Angry birds and the view is amazing! We weren't really into 'Sentosa and the whole theme park' thing. A good activity in the middle of day when too hot and had enough of shopping centres!!
,,Expensive but a worthwhile part of a visit to Sentosa and Mount Faber,4.0,,"The $29 for this ride seems like a lot if you treat this as the main event, but think of it as a spectacular view that comes with a trip from the Sentosa attractions of Imbiah to the Jewel Box at Mount Faber and it makes more sense.

Do note that the cars are not air conditioned though, so it makes sense to avoid the middle of the day to take your ride. In the evening you can actually eat dinner on board in a florally-enhanced car, as you do several laps (one for each course)."
,,Too costly for a warm ride,3.0,,29SGD for a return trip is a bit too much. It is quite hot inside and the view was just okay until it reached over the cruise liner and Sentosa resorts.
,,"Lots of hype, somewhat overrated",3.0,,"Overpriced, overrated but nonetheless something to experience in Singapore. There are much better things to do though."
,,long ago,4.0,,did this ride back in 1990 and it was great then and it looks as though its still as good really worth doing
,,what a ride,4.0,,expensive like the rest of singapore but amust do for once. This ride to the Sentosa is very interesting . The view is fantastic and in no time we reached Sentosa floating over the sea. We bought a return ticket but nobody should do that as one ride is enough for the experience
,,Singapore Cable Car,5.0,,"Staffs are all friendly and endearing. From the ticket counter to the boarding staffs to the souvenir shop. The design of the cable cars are excellent esp the Angry Birds ones. My kids love them!
And the family Jewel card is great! Unlimited admissions, what more could anyone ask for!"
,,memory of the cable cars incident,5.0,,"I feel very high up and see many view of singapore. It bring back the good, bad and ugly of the incident. Even i am not in it."
,,"Spectacular view, a little overpriced though",3.0,,"The veiws over the city are great, it was nice to relax after walking around Vivo City & the Harbour Front for ages and a novel way to get to Sentosa. We felt it was overpriced though so if you are on a tight budget we would say this isn't a 'must do' in our opinion, but enjoyable if you are not concerned about cost. We were lucky not to have to share a car on the first leg of the ride so could move around and take pics, on the way down we had other people in with us and it was impossible to get a pic of anything."
,,Good place but.....,3.0,,"a good place but the price for a ride was pretty expensive! but overall still good! the staff was normal and the services was also normal, nothing much to complain about except for the price."
,,Head for Heights,5.0,,"Took the tHe cable car from the midpoint, 15 stories up. $29 SGD return a little expensive especially for a family. Roomy cars and stable so no need to fear. At the high point of the cable the car must be at least 39 stories above the ground. Spectacular views of Singapore and an even better view of Sentosa Island."
,,Great views,4.0,,What can we say? It's a cable car and they are ALWAYS fun. This one takes you to Sentosa and you get great views en route.
,,Pooped myself!,4.0,,Very good if you have a head for heights and I realised that I don't! The views are amazing but I had to get a taxi back as I was too scared to repeat the experience. If have no fear of heights this is amazing.
,,Excellent view,5.0,,"Bit on the expensive side, but the view from the cable is fantastic and is worth it. The ticket is a return ticket, so you can enjoy both daytime and night time views"
,,Ride to Sentosa,4.0,,"Awesome view. First time getting on cable car was in Colorado, USA. This experience was more fun and more special because I was on a date with my fiance. Def. worth it for a first time experience rather than taking the bus option."
,,Awesome Views,5.0,,"The singapore cable car provides you with some of the amazing views of singapore. Its quite a long ride with excellent aerial views of singapore. I, however, suggest you take this ride on late evenings when the place is a cooler because during the day, its a bit hot and you may not enjoy it as much."
,,Cable care,4.0,,"Rare experience. Spectacular view of singapore and port esp.. Ticket is worth. My travel partner could not accompany me due to the fact that cable car is not disable friendly. It keeps on moving and travelers have to jump in, which my polio victim travel partner could not do."
,,Awesome ride over the seas,5.0,,"If you are planning to Visit Sentosa, then don't forget to take the cable car from Mt Fabor. The ride over the sea is really awesome!"
,,Great thing to do.,5.0,,"Great trip to Sentosa from VivoCity , u would enjoy this ride, and. Return journey as well. Remeber to take a sentosa day pass or something in which this Ride is also included."
,,Don't unscrew it,4.0,,"We traveled to Sentosa on this. One of our friends does like heights so we warned him not to swing about as the gondola would unscrew and we would end up in the water below. Mistake, nothing would convince him we were joking. Views were good, loads of photos taken, large cruise ships looked rather puny from our height. Cheap at the price although the entrance on the main Island is not obvious to find. Until you find it and then it is obvious."
,,Try it once!,3.0,,"I travelled to sentosa in the cable car, we were 4 guys. It was an ok expereince. The height was good and a lot of greenery to see udnerneath. But its nothing extremely different. But if you have to go to Sentosa, then this is probably the best way. Take pictures, that would be memorable."
,,Best way to travel to Sentosa,3.0,,Nothing big or fancy here - quite simply a cable car ride that can be enjoyed by those of all ages. Definitely the best way to go into Sentosa as the view of the island is great. Try to avoid traveling in the car during the peak heat of the day as the sun warms the cars up and they get quite hot! A must-do activity whilst in Singapore.
,,worth every cent!,5.0,,"If it's your first time in Singapore, the Cable Car is a must-see. We went Saturday morning and there was only a short 5-minute wait before we were up in the air. All the cars at the moment are Angry Birds themed which can be fun for children or equally as amusing for adults. The ride itself is only about 10 minutes, but the view can't be beat. Santosa Island is a bit touristy and is more geared for children. The average tourist probably won't spend more than an hour there after snapping photos of the Merlion and stopping for something to drink. Everything costs money once you get to the island, so take this into consideration when planning activities on Santosa."
,,high up !!!,5.0,,"A really good adventure up into Faber Mountain where there is a fantastic veiw of the Jungle underneath .From up in the cable car you can see the city, habour and Sentosa Island .There are limited edition cable cars, from the themed angry birds to V.I.P.cable cars and wedding cable car for an additional fees.Cost $ 18 child,$29 adult, note only one bus for the way down, so buy a return ticket and you can get off at a different stop to go the MRT."
,,Fun,5.0,,It was a lot of fun to ride with kids and enjoy the view. Great service. Conveninet location and safe facility.
,,Enjoyed It,4.0,,"The best way to reach Sentosa. Tickets are available as a part of Sentosa attraction either from Harbour Front or Mount Faber. Its short distance, but you will definitely get an excellent view of Harbour, Sentosa Island and enjoy the heights."
,,Awesome !!!!!,5.0,,"Wow...you can see entire sentosa island, tanah merah ferry port, and singapore port. It's amazing experience...cool dude"
,,Fabulous views,5.0,,"I have been to Singapore many many times, and have always meant to take this trip. I wish I had done it earlier, it is excellent."
,,An experience,4.0,,"We felt this was quite expensive as you have to buy a return ticket. However, it is quite exciting with amazing views of the city. We stopped at Mount Faber for lunch before doing the return journey. We took the ride at lunch time on a hot and sunny day and the temperature in the car was extremelly high as it is obviously not air conditioned and there are only small window outlets. Itt might be better to choose your time of day or go on a cloudy day."
,,Exciting ride,4.0,,Really exciting – although slightly terrifying for those who don’t like heights – way to get to Sentosa. It’s relatively expensive – yet well worth it for the amazing views of the City and overall experience. Our son loved the whole Angry Birds theme. Was raining when we went and was slightly overcast towards Mt. Faber so just did the Sentosa section of the journey – would like to do the Mt Faber section on our next visit to the City…
,,Nice views and straight into Universal,4.0,,The cable car was a nice touch. I probably would not take the return trip as once we got back out from Sentosa we had trouble getting a taxi. Enjoyed the experience!
,,Good veiws,5.0,,Enjoyed this one. Great ariel views of Singapore and a great way to access Sentosa Island. Part of a day package so can't comment on value for money
,,Amazing Ride,4.0,,"The cable car ride was one of the good experience for us. In the cable car ride we saw the star cruise vergo, The expensive mall of the Singapore and the Port area of the Singapore. The ride takes almost 20-25 minutes to complete and that was the great experience."
,,"Expensive but hey, would you travel any other way?",4.0,,"Yes yes, as per everything else in Singapore, it's expensive.
But what a lovely way to travel!
Travelling is all about experiencing different things and we certainly don't have one of these in Melbourne. We loved it, it was clean and comfortable and the ride was very relaxing. Good job."
,,Excellent Ride and Great view from the top,5.0,,"We reached Mount Faber point by taxi and took ticket. This was the Angry Birds season, so the box had angry birds posters . They offered free mocktail in collectible cup.
Always start from Mt.Faber, since it is starting point. The view of singapore was awesome with ships anchored at sea . The best time is around evening where the you can enjoy the sunset and lightings around. The box car have small openings where you can feel the wind. Quite a awesome feeling. The journey was so smooth and calming. At the end of the ride you feel like asking for more."
,,Angry Birds Cable Car to Sentosa Island,4.0,,"First time in Singapore. First time on a cable car. I'm afraid of heights but the view from the cars were fab!
The cars are currently sponsored by Angry Birds so it was quite funny to see every other car decked out in the different angry birds theme. They even have an angry bird character cuddly toy in the cars (just for photo ops). For the price you pay, you get to go to Sentosa Island, a return to Mount Faber and then back to Harbour Front (where we started). Make sure you get your free Angry Birds drinking cup from Mount Faber!"
,,Worth spending a little extra for this cable car,3.0,,"It might look a touch expensive and the cable ride might be too small length wise .... but it was worth spending the amount and use this .... You get to see a beautiful view of the city and Sentosa Island ....

The cars we were in were very clean and well managed .... We took a combo package which included couple of other activities to utilise from many options ....

Should go there after you have been to Universal Studios ... Next day would be better ...."
,,Jewel Box cable car ride,1.0,,"We were at Mt.Faber on 19th July 2012 .. To begin with, there was no parking faciity whatseoever.....only valet parking (which I got to know about too late!). There were limited directions on where to purchase the cable car tickets....the valets (who were very friendly) asked us to go upstairs - the cablecar attendants guided us to shop front on Level 2 - who in turn asked to go back downstairs just behind the valets parking counter !

The guy at the ticket counter was a disinterested bloke...possibly bored that there were hardly any visitors....atleast when we took the ride. We were forced to buy return journey (via cable car) tickets at $$29/pax. They do NOT sell one-way cable car tickets! Did I tell you that they also give you free drink (sugar water) and some angry bird masks!

While the cable car ride by itself is good, the management should consider a $15/pax - one way option.

Go for the ride only if you have small kids.... There are other places from where you would have a better (and prettier) view of the Singapore!"
,,pissed my pants,5.0,,i'm scared of hightsv so when we told our taxi driver to take us over to santosa island and we ended up at the cable car i almost pissed my pants. i had no choice but to get on and head over. it was fantastic. smooth and calming.
,,Peaceful gliding,3.0,,It makes for an interestingly different way of travelling to Sentosa island from Singapore. There are special capsules also which are decked for a romantic trip across. One can see the sentosa merlion from above as well and it was a peaceful interlude in the hectic sight-seeing schedule that we had that day( which had us doing Jurong bird park by morning and Sentosa island by the afternnon through the evening!)
,,angry Birds themed cable car ride to Sentosa Island,4.0,,Expensive trip on a cable car to Sentosa Island from Mt Faber. Great views though. The cable cars are small and are not air conditioned but the journey is quite quick. It stops at a mall on the water front and then again at Sentose; you can alight wherever you wish. My son is an Angry Birds fan and we had a free ticket to do this with out Singapore Stopover package.
,,Fun ride in the sky,4.0,,This is a great way to get to Sentosa from Singapore. Very close to the MRT station (5 minute walk). The ride is about 10-12 mins and has one stop at the Jewel Box where you can alight and take in the view from Mt. Faber and then continue along for the rest of the journey. The views from the cable car were spectacular. The themed cars for Angry birds were bright and colorful. Take the ride for both ways as the cost is pretty much the same.
,,Loving the Angry Birds,5.0,,"I have travelled on Singapore's iconic cable cars several times and still thrill at the view and sensation of soaring above the ground.
This time we took our 4 year old daughter and she loved the Angry Birds-themed car, free mocktail and Angry Birds masks.
Well worth a visit."
,,Awesome experience,5.0,,"you get a full view of Sentosa and Singapore specially in the night it looks beautiful, we all loved it and clicked loads of pictures. it was an amazing part of our visit to Sentosa Island."
,,world's first angry birds cable car ride,4.0,,"For 28sgd round trip, we rode the cable car with a huge angry birds stuff toy which we hugged and took pictures of. The view was awesome and we thoroughly enjoyed the ride."
,,"Great views over the harbor, the skyline and Sentosa Island",5.0,,"We took the Cable Car from Mount Faber to Sentosa Island and we loved the views from our cabin. It's the best way to arrive to Sentosa Island, I think, it gives you a great overview of the island. We went on the Singapore Flyer and checked out the views from the Marina Bay Sands skypark, but the views from the Cable Car were entirely different, because of its location further south. There is also a little museum when we got off the Cable Car on Sentosa Island which shows the history of the cable car, how the cabins have changed over the years and other interesting trivia - make sure to check it out when you get to Sentosa."
,,Great view & pricing,3.0,,We catch the cable car from santos after a day in the universal studio. The cost for 2 adult & 1 child return $79.00. Very pricing for a short trip. But great view & smooth ride. We will not be doing this trip again.
,,Singapore Cable Car,5.0,,"An iconic attraction in itself, the Singapore Cable Car presents bird's eye view of Singapore's city skyline, the harbour, and Sentosa. Photo opportunities are abundant with the cabin’s 360° panoramic windows - making it the best ride with the best view to Sentosa. The new cabins have also been enhanced to offer guests a World-leading experience in terms of comfort, design and technology.

Double the pleasure as your ticket gains you admission into Sentosa, as well as Asia’s First Cable Car Museum. Alight at Mount Faber Station, to visit Mount Faber Park, one of the oldest hilltop parks in Singapore and a popular tourist destination. Take a stroll through this haven of greenery and drop by The Jewel Box, fondly known as Singapore’s Iconic Hilltop Destination, a scenic place to have a meal, or a few drinks to end the day on a high note!"
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"Excellent experience. My children loved the Angry Birds theme. Its better to buy a full round trip connecting mount fabber, vivo city and sentosa, to enjoy the scenic views of harbour and city togather with sentosa."
,,great views,4.0,,great views and a nice respite from the crowds in other forms of transport!
,,"Stunning views, good fun, expensive.",4.0,,"We paid for the $29 dollar return trip, now with free Angry Birds face masks and an angry birds soda drink and cup.

The angry birds stuff is definitely a win for the kids!

However the stunning views are the real win, we saw Singapore in the daylight but also came back during sunset (stunning)

There are so many things you can look out for (your hotel / boats / rides etc)

The only downside is the cost, $29 is an expensive was of getting to sentosa (which is never going to be a cheap day out) - but the views are unrivalled.

The jewel box is also a very nice launch platform and a nice place to spend time."
,,Very enjoyable ride,5.0,,This is a short ride but very enjoyable as you will see the landscape of Singapore. A great way to go to Sentosa on the way to Universal Studios.
,,not quite romantic.. but,4.0,,"My husband booked the Sky Dining experience as a surprise. It would have been perfect if we were not assaulted by the ANGRY BIRDS promo blaring from the monitor as we departed from the Jewel Box each trip. It was only at the end we discovered a mute button. For the dining cars I do believe a small CD of suitable dinner music would be far nicer but instead we heard the Angry Birds promo and the same Carpenters song each trip (the sky dining experience traverses the harbour three times)

We found it a little confusing on arrival as it was hard to know where to go to find the Sky Dining people (a sign directed us to a corner but no one was there) but the meals and service after that were lovely.

If you intend to propose to someone or enjoy a romantic evening... make sure you work out how to turn off the television in the car.

Other than the audio assault we enjoyed the trip and the experience immensely."
,,Dont know what the fuss was all about,3.0,,"Everyone told me how great it would be, but I didnt see something that they did obviously. Maybe I was just expecting more because of all the great reviews."
,,Angry Birds,5.0,,My kids loved this Angry Bird cable car ride. The big red angry bird in the car added to their pleasure. Gorgeous views of Singapore specially at night. We also loved the idea that you could book a cable car and have a meal in it! Spectacular night view of the entire layout of Singapore. Very convenient if you are travelling to Sentosa island. The Jewel Box shop also had lovely Angry Bird stuff!
,,Scary but fun,4.0,,Has to be the best way to approach Sentosa. Of course many years a ship cut the cable and everybody had to rescued by S'porean military but you probably won't have such an exciting time...
,,Sentosa,2.0,,It's a mini fun park that's all . May be good for family with kids but not a lots to see.
,,Good deal - good experience for the family,3.0,,"The ride itself was not that long compared to the Cable Car in HK but the scenery was very good especially when getting near Sentosa. Since i was with my family (4), we applied for the Jewel Card family membership for unlimited access for 1 year by paying S$99. Initially, they offered the Angry Birds family membership worth S$139 but I told the counter personnel that I will not opt for it. Otherwise, I would have paid for $29 per person and that will only be good for one trip. The deal I got should be good for a family of four who has also just settled in Singapore.

From Harbourfront Tower, you can opt to go directly to Sentosa or go to Mount Faber. However, since this is a loop ride, it would be best to first go to Sentosa then Mount Faber especially if you're buying a ticket and not getting the Jewel Card."
,,Cable Car experience,5.0,,"The cable car experience at Sentosa Island in Singapore is simply ""Awesome"". Its very well managed, well maintained and very safe. It can be enjoyed by all the age groups. It is highly recommended to experience the cable car if anybody is visiting Sentosa Island in Singapore.

Regards

,,great view but bad weather,4.0,,"definetly take the cable car ride, but stay away from singapore in February"
,,A Must!,5.0,,This is a must do not only for the views along the way but for the sheer pleasure of it. The assistants were very capable and assisted us on and off the cable car as it is moving all the time. The cars were clean and looked well maintained.
,,You should not miss this views,5.0,,"Is really a great view of the city up here! It was great, we really enjoy the round trip ride"
,,Not for the feint of heart!,5.0,,"Wow, this is one heck of a high ride. My wife is scared of heights and spent most of the journey with her eyes closed. I'm not but I have to say it still freaked me out a bit. that being said it's an amazing view and a fun way to travel over to Sentosa Island - I recommend it at least once!"
,,Short & sweet,4.0,,"OK so its not a long ride, or a particularly high one. But, still worth it. Its a great option to use to get up to Mount Faber or to get to Sentosa Island. Take the glass bottom one's for great views. Or try the Sky Dining option, have a three course meal while on the cable car in your own private car!"
,,Bird's Eye View,3.0,,"Try it at night, it's beautiful ! Good place for photographers, as you can capture almost the whole Singapore!"
,,Love the view.,4.0,,Great views but for the best ride get the cable from mount faber to sentosa.
,,"Quick, efficient and easy way to Sentosa and back",4.0,,Always go for the return fare and enjoy the break journey..;)
,,Great experience.!,5.0,,"Not for those who hate heights - but if that doesn't bother you it's a must.! Amazing panoramic views of Singapore & it's beauty of city, jungle & ocean rolled into one.! Great value for money.!!!"
,,a very peaceful way to enjoy the view,4.0,,"this is a thumbs up for everyone who wants to see singapore from an eagles eye view, see the big ships, sentosa, etc"
,,"Nice view, but overpriced",2.0,,"Cable car ride offers good views of Sentosa and mainland Singapore, but at 26SGD return ticket for a 10 minute per direction trip, it is overpriced. View is not so spectacular as to warrant this price. $3 monorail is much better option.

For romantic dining option, however, this may be okay. It is certainly a unique date/celebration idea to dine in cable car from/to Jewel Box."
,,Singapore Cable Car,5.0,,Singapore is a lovely lovely place - it is like Disney World and better. It is very safe and be sure and have High Tea at Rafflesl Hotel - nothing like there high tea.
,,Do it for the views!,4.0,,"Ideally get a return journey on this attraction, doing one way during the day and the other during the night. The views from the cable car are really lovely, and on a clear day you can see quite far into the distance; doing it during the night is another experience as the cable cars have lights which make them glimmer like stars.
I went for the standard cable car which was very comfortable, it felt very stable and very safe. Thankfully unlike many cable cars, the windows were clean which meant you could take good pictures. I did not however appreciate the advertisements on the TV, which I felt were distracting from the tranquillity.
You can get the cable car from either Harbourfront (follow the signs; the entrance is in a bit of a weird place) or Mount Faber from which there are glorious views of Sentosa and beyond; you can alight the cable car at Sentosa where you will find yourself at Imbiah Lookout.
A couple of things to make the experience better: improve the signage from Harbourfront; encourage the staff to be a bit more enthusiastic; improve the arrival and departure walk from the cable car station to the Harbourfront ticket office and vice versa.
Overall a fantastic experience for everyone and anyone, one which I would thoroughly recommend, especially if you love cable cars.

TIP: If you are a tourist, sign up for a Tourist Privilege Card at Vivocity Mall (next door to Harbourfront) to get 10% off cable car rides."
,,Great view,4.0,,"I have been on this many times as a kid years ago but took family on here recently when returning to city from
Universal studios.

Seemed expensive but they loved it and thought it was money well spent for the view.

Can get hot as only cooled by open windows/vents so go at cooler times in the day.

One way is enough to enjoy the view rather than return as there are many other quicker options for getting to/from Sentosa now."
,,An experience never to forget,4.0,,"We loved the trip to Sentosa, and the train ride around, were entertained by the music fountain at night, and sight not to forget. A fair price and easy to find."
,,Oh the views!,4.0,,"We bought a return ticket on Sentosa Island which took us to the Jewel Box on Mount Faber, and then returned us to the Harbourfront tower. The views were stunning! An added bonus was the free tea/coffee and cake at the Jewel Box on our arrival - very nice."
,,Good package made the price more bearable,4.0,,"We loved the trip over to Sentosa and as they bundled it in with a few other attractions it was quite reasonable in price, we felt like the proper tourists being shown around Sentosa on a guided tour even though we live her ;). The view is not as spectacular as that of the city or around Marina Bay Sands, but it is a fair bit older as an attraction. For those of you with slight vertigo, maybe avoid it."
,,not worth the money,3.0,,"all I can say is it's just ok... once is enough.
You do get a fare bit of ride in the cable car, and the view of sentosa and PSA (port of singapore)
but nothing so thrilling

If you just want to go to sentosa, monorail is a better option
If you just want to go to mt faber/jewel box, a bus or taxi will take you there
it's not a mean of transport to get you to one of the above, but mainly the attraction in itself, which as i said in the rating, just average."
,,Worth the experience,4.0,,"This is a great way to get to Sentosa, but dont do it if you have any fear of heights, because the cable car is very high above the harbour. Its a little unnerving as you launch out of the World Trade building, but you soon relax to take in the view. Its not the place to view the city as a whole, but certainly around the water front area and Sentosa the view is very good. You can catch the cable car from Mount Faber for a longer ride if you so desire."
,,Cable car to Sentosa with wheelchair,5.0,,"We were told we couldn't join trip on coach to sentosa as there were 58 steps up to cable car platform. Decided to go independenty and took taxi to Mount Faber. There is a lift up to the cable car. We chose a day when we knew it would not be busy and did not have to queue. There was just room for the wheelchair and us in the cable car. Bought a one way ticket and took lots of photos. Exciting ride. Walked down ramp to see Merlion and then caught train to Beach station and bus to Siloso point and then went to Underwater World. We saw Dolphin show and then went into the Aquarium and saw the 'petting' ponds beloved of children. There is a lift - just ask for it as not signposted - this will take you down to -1 floor and then down to -2 floor where there is a moving walkway to take you through the aquarium with the fish swimming over and around you. Lots of other interesting exhibits such as garden eels and various crabs, octopus etc.
There are lots of other things to do on Sentosa and a variety of differently priced packages.
We found it easy to get around. Lots of eateries. We then took the bus and train back to Harbour front mall which is very attractively landscaped and then walked through to Vivo city mall and caught a taxi back to the hotel.
Altogether an excellent excursion without the confines of a coach trip."
,,REALLY ROMANTIC RIDE,5.0,,"Beautiful scenery & very ROMANTIC, Went with my girlfriend for an very amazing experience. her favorite song was played the moment when we went inside the cable car!"
,,Nice ride with views of waterfront,3.0,,"Took cable car from Mount Faber (ok panoramic views) to Sentosa & back to harbour front. Got nice views of harbour front area & Sentosa's rides & ships out to sea. Imo unless u want to go Sentosa, u better views of city from Marina Bay Sands."
,,Good experience - not cheap,4.0,,"One has to take a taxi to the main cable car terminal where you get tickets. You get a view of Sentosa, the water, the port and trees. Not exceptional - good for one try."
,,Beautiful views,4.0,,The cable car is a scenic way to get from Singapore to Sentosa Island. The cable cars are very nice and enclosed and can hold a lot of people if necessary (we saw groups of up to 8 or so). It is a little expensive but I think it is more fun than catching public transportation. Maybe not great if you are scared of heights though (my friend was somewhat uncomfortable during the trip).
,,Worth the Trip...Take in the Sights enroute to Sentosa,4.0,,"For $26 SGD per person roundtrip, it is worth the extra $2 vs going only one way. For us, this is that rare occasion in crowded (5 Million people on this small island) Singapore to take in the sights from a high vantage point with just your friends and loved ones. The Flyer capsule and Marina Bay Sands do not offer this type of privacy. Relish the view and take some time to absorb the beauty of the area.

Note: As the cars are not airconditioned, it is best to plan your timing outside of mid-day if possible. If possible, have one way during the day and the other at night to take in the different view with the Singapore lights. Beautiful!"
,,Very cool for the sights.,4.0,,Well worth the money for a good ride with great sights. Needs air conditioning in each cabin.
,,Fabulous way to see Sentosa and parts of Singapore,5.0,,"We went there on our first night in Singapore. Took a taxi from our hotel to Mount Faber, and visited the nice view point there and fish pond there.

The two way trip by cable car cost us 26 SGD per adult and 15 SGD per child, a total of 82 SGD! Very expensive, but the return ticket is only a little bit pricier than one way.

The cars are new and clean, and the view stunning! We went to Sentosa around 5.15 pm, and returned around 9 pm. Therefore we got to see both daylight and nighttime, a wonderful experience.

We were passing right over cruise ships in the harbour, and loved the feeling of flying. Don't miss this trip while in Singapore!"
,,Sentosa Island,4.0,,"Took a tour as we only visited for 4 days & wanted to get in as much as we could, visited the island, butterfly gardens & dolphin/sea-lion attraction."
,,Take a taxi to Mont Faber,5.0,,At first we wanted to take the cable car from Harbourfront. But taxi uncle suggested us to take from Mont Faber. The view is panoramic and amazing.
,,Super views and nice cars.,5.0,,I had a lovely dinner at the jewel box restaurant at Mount Faber and decided to take a night ride pn the cable car. The relatively new renovated system has been upgraded and is much higher than its previous Avtar. The round trip takes around 20 minutes if one doesn't make any stops along the way at the 2 stations-Sentosa and Vivo city. The car takes you high above the cruise terminal and docked cruise ships and the hugely popular Universal Studios theme park. The interiors are comfortable and there are also a few VIP cars with better appointed decor. All in all a vey interesting experience. The Jewel Box restaurant at Mount Faber is highly recommended but do note that there is limited parking though the restaurant has solved for this by having a valet parking service-albeit at a fee of singapore $5.
,,Nice short ride,4.0,,Beautiful view of main island and sentosa island. Stuffy and small cabin. Short ride.
,,One way rip off,3.0,,"Cost for cable car alone, from Harbour Front to Sentosa, one way is SGD24.00 yet return ticket is SGD26.00! Next time we'll walk across the boardwalk."
,,Over-priced,3.0,,Way too expensive for a ride. Nice views of Singapore harbour and Sentosa island though. Go once for the experience and it would be quite enough.
,,worth to go with,4.0,,"The view is fantastic and the cable car is very stable, though the wind might blow a little bit. One thing to be kept in mind: don`t look down, especially if you don`t like high places:))) Overall, it is an interesting way to travel to Sentosa and the view is better then the one that can be admired from the top of Marina Sands."
,,Spectacular views,4.0,,This is quite an expensive ride and it is worth booking your return if you know you want to go back the same way. Otherwise it is even more expensive. The sights of the city and harbour are great with excellent visability.
,,Nice view,3.0,,"The car moved at a desirable speed, not too fast nor too slow. It offered a good view of Sentosa island and Mt. Faber. Not recommended for those with claustrophobia or acrophobia though. Better buy a round trip ticket than a one-way ticket."
,,Overpriced ride,3.0,,"I shouldn't have gone on this cable car. Nothing special about it, and it doesn't come cheap. Sure they say it comes with admission to the cable car museum, but there's not much to see there. Should've gone somewhere else."
,,An excellent ride,5.0,,"Get a top down view of the harbour front and sentosa islands from the singapore cable car. we took the full ride from the harbour front. you can also do a hop to sentosa from the HF or the other way around. there are nice views of the harbour from the top. you also get to see the cruise ships, moored or setting off from the harbour front. it was a bit pricey, but the ride was worth it."
,,Nice View of Singapore Harbour,4.0,,We took the cable car from this tiny mountain top. The view from the top is great. Can capture the a great over view of Singapore Harbour.
,,Good but expensive for what you get,3.0,,"Have been on the cable car twice near. Definitely better at night than in the day but very expensive compared to other options to get to Sentosa.

Light rail costs $3 for the day compared with more than $17 for the cable car (and I think that rate was discounted because we went at night).

Overall nice views but if you are interested in views, the Singapore Flyer has better/longer lasting views."
,,Cable Ride from Sentosa Island,4.0,,"Its a innovative cabin, with black tinted glasses. Better than the earlier one. These cabins are sponsored by Canon!!!..Worth a one way trip either from sentosa or to sentosa"
,,Quite a ride.,5.0,,"From Mount Faber via Jardine Steps, these 2 pick up points take you on a wonderful journey over the harbour, where boats discharging, or embarking cargo, are examples of the every day working life of Singapore. Up and over another 'staging point' on towards Sentosa, the island with plenty of memories, and facilities."
,,Seeing from Above,4.0,,If you have the time its worth the ride for the sights you will see
,,Very modern & nice Cable Car,5.0,,"When we want to go to sentosa we always like to go by cable car , it's a very nice trip my kids like it , the view for the harbor is really nice , the trip is short not long one like the one in Gentling Highlands in Malaysia & it's very safe trip.
To go to the cable car station it's either to go by taxi or to MRT to VIVO city which you will find three ways of transportation to Sentosa the train , the cable car or walking ..the cable car station is on the next building not the main mall, you can buy tow way ticket if you will leave before 9.30 pm other wise buy a one way ticket & return by the train."
,,Breathtaking....,4.0,,"The cable car is a great transport to go to the highest peak, the views are great up above. Great to take cable car ride during afternoon between 4pm to 5pm... not too hot.... nice experience."
,,great view over singapore,5.0,,good opportunitie for photography lovers to delite themselves and a very original way to get to sentosa island
,,Overpriced,2.0,,"This is a very expensive short trip. Yes the cars are clean and well maintained but at a cost of $78 for myself and my 2 daughters to do a short trip to Mt Faber, then to Sentosa and back I would far rather take the $3 express to Sentosa and a cab up Mt Faber. I have been on other cable cars elsewhere in the world and this would be the worst value for money anywhere. Others obviously agreed it was overpriced judging by the people that left the ticket office without buying tickets once they realised how much it would cost. Sentosa was also overpriced and empty when we went."
,,Short thrill,4.0,,"If you're gg to Sentosa, the cable car is one of the many options (most expensive though).

I've been on the cable car before and after its renovation and I must say kudos to Jewel Box. The ride experience has been better.

The toilet at Jewel Box is luxurious. It's better than any hotels in Singapore - glass exterior which gives patrons an amazing view of the cable car and the sea."
,,nice view and well maintained,4.0,,"Though it is pricey, it is well maintained which matters the most. the views are good and we enjoyed the trip to the top of mt faber."
,,Wow what a view !,5.0,,"Large clean cars, helpful staff & a great way to get across where you can see the new Disney land park etc we have done it twice now and will prob do again on our next visit."
,,Too short,3.0,,"The cable car is a fun way to get to Sentosa, but the ride is very short. Especially for the price. If you want to do it, I recommend only taking it one way. A one-way ticket is $10, while the round trip is $26/person. The ride itself is about five minutes, maybe less."
,,"Jaw-Dropping View, Immaculate Cable Car, Agonizingly Slow & Swelteringly Hot Wait for Tickets",5.0,,"The cable car itself, the new ""Jewel"" car is $24 one way and $26 roundtrip. The ride is so pleasant (though unairconditioned) and the view so unbelievable, that you won't want it to end, so consider making it as long as possible (about 10 mins) by catching the cable car at Mount Faber on the main island of Singapore rather than at the Harbourfront Office Tower 2 (also on the island of Singapore, but closer to the water/southern shore, from which the ride is about 7 minutes).

The cable car has but one station on the island of Sentosa at Imbiah Lookout, which is a small hill, next to the Images of Singapore museum and not far from the Merlion.

The cable car is hands down better than the monorail, which is crowded, smelly and wasn't operating for part of the day I tried to ride it (Jan 23, 2012) due to ""overcrowding"".

There's a nice (and free) Singapore Cable Car Museum inside the cable car building on the island of Sentosa. Worth a look. Has older versions of the cable cars dating back to 1970 as well as one made of Lego."
,,Take a change of underwear :),5.0,,"This was a great way to see Singapre and get over to Sentosa Island! If you have a fear of heights then you are going to pee your pants on this, it's quite scarey as it leaves the cable car station but what a view!! You can get a deal by booking your cable car ticket along with a couple of activities to do when on Sentosa, worth doing."
,,Boring Ride,2.0,,A boring ride. Not much scenery to enjoy. Relatively expensive; not worth the price!
,,"Excellent fun, very relaxing",5.0,,We did this as part of our Singapore tour. We started at the Jewel Box with a group dinner and later did the Cable Car. Except for the price the trip was wonderful.
,,A great view of Singapore,4.0,,"I suggest that you take this in a part of a Cable car ride that will give you outstanding views of Singapore. Not only great views but nice restaurants are available at top of Mt. Faber and near cable car station at the cruise center, Vivo City or on Sentosa Island."
,,Fun ride,5.0,,"Have done this one several times, much nicer since it was newly renovated. This is just fun, pass over a cruise ship in a cable car and land on Sentosa Island where there is a good selection of activities available :-)."
,,SCARY AND EXCITING,4.0,,Oh well it was scary especially the first half but the view from the cable car is mesmeric so keep ur cameras and handy cams ready when u get on the ride.The ride itself is pretty comfortable.
,,Mesmerizing- Do not miss it,5.0,,"An amazing experience worth the price. We had taken the two way ticket, which helped us to view the beautiful scenery at different times of the day- Daytime gave us the beautiful glimpse of the island and the return in the night was a very soothing experience.
Tip: Dont forget to visit the bathroom facilities near the ticket counter at the mount Faber- It is one of the best designed bathrooms.
#Also check the with for discount coupons available in the Singapore tourist booklet.
#Maybe difficult to get taxi while going back so need to book on call."
,,Nice view,3.0,,"Nice way to go to Sentosa, short ride with a beauitful view, but overpriced of course. 22SP$ for a two way ticket."
,,Nice Ride,5.0,,We took the two way ticket and the ride was fascinating. can take a greater view specially the harbor.
,,An expensive way to get to Sentosa,4.0,,"But..... great views while you get delivered right into the heart of the island. If it's not out of your budget, I'd definately recommend doing it."
,,A super ride across to Sentosa Island,5.0,,A lovely smooth ride to take across to Sentosa Island and super pictures were taken of the view. Then took the express train back. Nothing else to say just give it a go!
,,Awesome Experience,4.0,,Those who travel to Singapore must visit Sentosa... It's costly but worth paying for enjoying the day... Cable car is the one of the highlight where you travel across sentosa and see the Sea and land changing and some times you also get chance to see the Luxury Cruise which will be anchored by the harbor which Cable car crosses...
,,Love it!,5.0,,Worth every second. Take the full trip from Mount Faber to Sentosa to experience the lovely views in your private cable car.
,,RIPOFF!!!!!!!,1.0,,"My brother (8) and I (12) went on the Cable Cars today from Sentosa Island to the mainland and were extremely bored. There really wasn't anything to see except for trees and a construction site. The ride was too short and a complete ripoff. It cost S $52, whereas a cab cost only S $10. My dad says that it was the same price as our lunch. On our way back, we had to get off in some building on the Harbor front and STILL had to take a cab back. My advice? Steer clear of the Singapore Cable cars and head for a taxi stop."
,,A new perspective on Singapore skyline,5.0,,"We enjoyed the cable car ride on a return trip - that way we got to enjoy the view both ways and at different times of the day. We then walked down to the monorail which we took to Universal Studios.

We took the underground to Harbour City and then walked over to the building where the cable car starts from the 16th floor. Although we are very good at directions and following signs, I would suggest that better signage is required as we endd up having to ask directions oncce we got into the Harbour City Shopping Centre."
,,Very high,5.0,,You cannot go to singapore and not ride this thing its just the best . The sights are just out of this world dont miss this ride its a must.
,,A rip off for a short ride,2.0,,"Well, the view is ok. But the price is not. I do not think this attraction give you value for money."
,,An OK way to spend a couple of hours (or less),3.0,,"Taking a trip on the cable car was an attempt to see Singapore from different angles and maybe get some photographs of the islands and beyond. It was not a good day for this as the haze was pronounced and visibility was low but as I have a flight out tomorrow, it was the only chance.
I got on the cable car at HarbourFront - easy to find and well signposted. I had originally wanted only to go to the hill station at Mount Faber but was told the ticket was valid for Sentosa too. I could have chosen a package of places to visit but these did not tempt me (inclusive costs seemed to range from about $S69 - 81 per adult). The cost of the full trip was $S26.00
I had the cable car to myself and snapped away - however the heat was tremendous and most embarassingly I had rivers of sweat pouring off me by the time I reached Mount Faber after what seemed like only a few minutes. Fake cherry trees were placed around the edge and when I tried to find my way out of the cable car platform (apart from the viewing platform and gift shop) all the exits had chains across them. I didn't ask if I could descend to road level and have a look around as I was so hot and sticky. After a cold coke ($S3.00) I thought I would take the full trip to Sentosa as I had hardly had my money's worth. The next car (and the subsequent one) were better ventilated and I made it to Sentosa without melting, took a few pictures of the Merlion but failed to avail myself of the 11 attractions on offer as they held little interest. As a person of more mature years, I just wasn't enticed by them but no doubt, if it had been 25 years earlier, my children might have enjoyed Tiger Ride (shooting I forget how many feet up into the air and down again), the Butterfly Park or actually going into the Merlion who seems a bit like the cousin of the concrete Big Merino. And it certainly wasn't the proprietors' fault that the visibility was so poor."
,,Fantastic views!,5.0,,"I'm so amazed that this attraction is only 46th! I LOVED it!! I'd ride the cable cars every day if I could. I really enjoyed the views and the trip...it was quicker than I'd hoped, but I got some killer pictures!

I got tickets for hubby and I for this on Groupon for a large discount - if you're travelling to Singapore, I'd advise you join Groupon.sg and keep an eye on the daily deals. I got tickets for the Singapore Flyer, Cable car, Sentosa Sky Tower, Segway tour, Original bus tour and the Hippo Tour (2 separate groupons)"
,,Not the grandest of rides but still fun,3.0,,"We've been on cable cars much scarier and views a little prettier (think New Mexico's ascent to their mountains) but somehow this was still fun.

We started by taking a cab to Mt. Faber, exploring the jewel box and some of the centerpieces they had around the complex as well as the views which was quite pleasant. We then took the car from there all the way over to Sentosa.

Ride was smooth and quick (the cars actually move quite fast in my opinion) and we took some time to explore the cable car museum (available when you get off in Sentosa) which was interesting (they have a car constructed entirely out of legos!).

Once you've done it once, no need to do it again."
,,Afternoon tour of Sentosa with beach laser show,5.0,,This was a great 7 hours. We booked a tour before leaving home and excellent. The cable car views were great and recommend using the this way to get over to the Island. The evening ended with the beach laser show which is spectacular - well worth it. We enjoyed the island so much we went back the next day and went to Univeral Studios. Had a great fun day out - go to Water World show (very funny and action packed). It only took us 15 mins to get from our city hotel via the MRT & cable car to get to Universal Studios. Great MRT system. Put your plastic card back in the machine at the MRT station when you get back to Singapore and select refund botton and you get S$1 refund - they recyce.
,,Great view,5.0,,Used the cable car to get to sentosa island so we could have a look round.
,,Enjoyable Cable Car trip from Mt Faber to Sentosa,4.0,,"Tried out the newly-improved Cable Car from Mount Faber to Sentosa. The 15-minute trip took us over Mt Faber's forested slopes and VivoCity, through the HarbourFront Tower and across water to Sentosa. Nice views of Universal City and Resorts World. We got off at Imbiah Lookout, where a quick walk took us to the Merlion Statue, Butterfly Garden and Insect Garden, the Images of Singapore Show, Tram Stations, etc. Kids enjoyed playing around the Merlion Walk, a mosaic walkway with fountains and streams. Would have rated this attraction 5 Stars if the Cable Car had aircon (or windows on the side that could open for ventilation) and drivers could park their cars within easy distance of the Mt Faber Cable Car Station."
,,Fabulous way to see Sentosa Island and beyond Singapore in a couple of hours,4.0,,The views from the Cable Car were breathtaking and the ride very smooth. We took the cable car from its high Jewel Box location across the bay to Sentosa and then took the free monorail back to Vivo City. Our pictures were some of the best we took in Singapore. $26 one way or $27 round trip for adults.
,,Wow what a view,4.0,,"Excellent way to see views of Singapore and Sentosa Island.

The cable car ride is Mount Faber - Harbour Front - Sentosa Island. You can take the cable car from Mount Faber (highest point), take a taxi from your hotel or harbour front (can reach by MRT). Mount Faber to Sentosa is around a 30 minute trip.

Single ticket is 24SGD or return 26SGD - consider spending the day on Sentosa taking the cable car in the AM and returning in the evening.

The views are really breathtaking we were fortunate enough to have a clear day which allowed views of the nearby Indonesian Islands."
,,Superb views of the city,4.0,,"I was attempting to keep to a tight budget and thought of paying $26 (Singapore dollars, about £13) for a return trip was the only reason this loses a star. But I was pleased I did it. We were only in Singapore 2 days in a grotty part of town so this was a great way of seeing what the city was really like. We got a return because I wanted to go up Mount Faber as well as look st Sentosa. It was a great view from up Mount Faber and very peaceful up there. Sadly we didn;t have time to go for a walk up there which someone recommended. As for Sentosa island - I just found it odd but interesting! Probably good for kids but you need ££££ to pay for everything."
,,Great views during the ride and on top of Mt. Faber - Shops and Cafes,5.0,,"I took the time to take the subway over to where you catch the cable cars. The cars go up to the top of Mt. Faber where there are shops and cafes with great views of Singapore and Sentosa Island. Then you go over down from Mt. Faber and over to Sentosa Island. The day I went, there was a cruise ship docked and the cable car went right over it for a terrific view of a sister cruise ship of one I had sailed with NCL."
,,Closed until some point in Q2 of 2010,1.0,,"I was so looking forward to going on this, went all the way to the Harbour Front to find that it is closed until some time in Q2 this year. No date given. i can only rate this as terrible as I could not go on it and the information about it being closed and when it was re opening again was not very good when I got to the ticket desk.

I would recommend this on the basis that seeing the span between start and end point, the views and the ride would be great."
,,"cable car not working until 2010, view from mount fabel very poor",2.0,,We went here to ride on the cable cars which are out of order until sometime in 2010 so we were bused to the top of the mount. There was nothing much there and the views pretty poor. Think they turn this area into a christmas wonderland so think that is the only time its worth visiting!
,,Better views from the Flyer but enjoyable enough,3.0,,"I took the cable car on a one way trip to Sentosa in the middle of the day (clear skies). I would recommend one way only and catching the monorail / bus back - it's not worth a return trip. To get full value for money, catch a taxi (e.g. from the rank outside Vivocity) up to the top of Mt Faber so you can catch the cable car the full way down. Don't expect fantastic photos - the cabin windows are scratched plastic. Better shots of Singapore (of the city) can be had from the Singapore Flyer with clear glass viewing. Note: cable car is closing 15 August 2009 until mid 2010 for renovations with improved cabins - so it should only get better."
,,Worthwhile view of city and harbour.,5.0,,"After a boat tour of the harbour, we took a ride on this gondola system starting at the center tower. This offered us a scenic round trip from the cruise ship terminal (where the station is in a high office tower), over to Mount Faber, across the water to Sentosa, then back to where we started. Our ticket permitted us to get off at Mount Faber to enjoy the breeze, have tea beside a Koi-filled pond, and admire the surrounding forest.

The view from every point of the journey was superb: downtown, the waterfront, the anchored ships, the Merlion on Sentosa.... The glass of our four-person gondola was clean. We could even open a window to admit a cooling breeze to relieve Singapore's constant heat and humidity. Best of all we got a higher view of a city that offers few thanks to its flatness and sheer size."
,,Nature had good mood!,5.0,,"We went to Singapore on 25th February 2007, the next day we went on a tour at Sentosa Island with the monorail and we returned back to Singapore by the Cable Car. No comments are enough to describe how we felt. Sentosa is a real paradise!!!! And the view when you are in the Cable Car is very special!!!!No need to say a lot, just do it!!!!!"
,,Breathtaking trip to Sentosa,5.0,,"Catch the cable car to Sentosa Island. We started at Mt Faber where there are fantastic views of Singapore and Sentosa island and all the ships coming into port. Make sure you have a glass bottom cable car, it is worth the extra. Definitely an attraction you shouldn't miss if you aren't afraid of heights."
,,Sentosa trip,5.0,,"We went by coach to Sentosa Island resort which was a day to remember.....a fab aquarium, dolphin show, history of Singapore display and more! We came back on the cable car across to Mt Faber and the views are stunning. So glad we went on this trip as we hadn't planned to initially - the highlight of our stay in Singapore."
,,Great way to Sentosa,5.0,,"I took this to Sentosa - opposite direction from Mt. Faber. Great way to get there. Great views of the city, you go right over the cruise ship terminal.

It leaves from Harbourfront center - the signage could be improved to find the entrance. Note the closing time - when I was there it was early so I bought one way and took the bus back."
