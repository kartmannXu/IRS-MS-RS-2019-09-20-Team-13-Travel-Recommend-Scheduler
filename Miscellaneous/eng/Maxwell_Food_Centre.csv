,,Great food for a great price!,4.0,,"I would give them a five stars, but the seating is sparse for how busy they are. However, the food is delicious and reasonably priced! We got a variety, and were very pleased with it all. The line for the famous chicken rice was really...More"
,,Tong Xin Ju Special Shanghai Tim-Sum,5.0,,"Delicious, to-die-for dumplings worth queuing for! Reasonably priced and generous portions. Hot & Sour soup that lets u works out a sweat. Everything is cooked to order so it‚Äôs piping hot when served. They are located in Maxwell Food Centre, unit number #01-92."
,,This is an Eye Opener ‚Äê Do It!!,5.0,,"To get here you should take the underground and get off at China Town. Walk through China Town, cross the very very busy road to the food centre.

All they do is food!!

Lots and lots of shall good outlets with one central seating area. The food is so so cheap that you think they have charged you incorrectly but it is cooked fresh and the volume turnover of customers is high.

GIVE a tip to the table cleaners. Don't leave it for them give it to them. These older Singapore residents need every penny you can spare and they really deserve it. A pound to us is like ¬£20 to them.

Enjoy the food and drink at Maxwell's. It's worth every penny and a great experience .

ENJOY!!!!"
,,Great chicken rice,4.0,,We had a good time here with a 5yr old. Clean and tidy. $5 for medium size chicken rice and $1.50 for sugarcane juice
,,Hawker fare,5.0,,"A must visit to good & cheap food; offering varieties of Singapore flavour of Hawker food. Near Chinatown area. Walk, walk ... see see .. U love it üòä"
,,Get the authentic food experience by visiting a Hawker Center!,4.0,,"Our tour guide brought us to this Hawker Center and said this is one of the better one's in Singapore. For your information, hawker centers are NOT street food. Street food is not allowed in Singapore. The hawker centers are controlled by the City for sanitary and health (per our tour guide). After hearing this we decided to give it a try. It was a wonderful, delicious and very inexpensive treat. Evidently the Chicken Rice is what you need to try and one of the booths in the center of the hawker centre was recommended and visited by Anthony Bourdain so our tour guide said this is the best place to eat chicken rice. Bourdain's picture appears in front of the booth. Go and enjoy the Singapore eating experience."
,,Cheap!,4.0,,"Maxwell is one of the few Hawker Centres open at lunch time. The centre has dozens and dozens of stalls spanning 3 or 4 double sided alleys which are filled with tables. We found the best approach was to walk up and down each alley to work out what we each wanted and then find two seats! Everyone is happy to share tables so once you find the desired number of seats pop something non-valuable on the table to reserve your spot and queue for your food! Singaporean‚Äôs are very polite and respectful of your reserved spot so it should be there when you get back with your food.

The popular food outlets can take 20-30 minutes to order whereas other queues are much shorter. Everything is so cheap. I had a large plate of fried rice with prawns for $4 and my partner had a plate of noodles and a generous serving of fried pork for $5!!! We also had large fresh mango juices for $3 each....

Maxwell is a very casual place and can get warm so where your summer clothes! It is very close to the MRT / Chinatown so easy to access. Alternatively a GRAB back to Orchard was about $10."
,,Authentic Singaporean Hawker Experience,5.0,,"As close to street food as you can get in Singapore... This bustling hawker centre smack in the middle of the business district is a genuine reflection of Singapore‚Äôs unique hawker culture, a mix of local hidden gems and the flashier ‚Äúfamous‚Äù stalls. A great experience! Beware the lunch crowd though."
,,Walk around before you Buy,4.0,,"This was our first food centre, and with two unsure teenage boys, we tried to settle in quickly. But I think the better idea is to look around and check out the different rows of stalls. Our mistake was getting some Hainanese Chicken (the staple dish of Singapore) without look at all the stalls. Had we just spent another 30 seconds to see the next row of stalls, we would have seen the famous Tian Tian chicken stall where there was a long line of foodies. Our Hainanese chicken (from another stall) was cold, and mediocre at best. We also got some Seafood Kway Teow, which was delicious.. and got some steamed dumplings. What I missed here was any INdian food.. which we went to Newton Centre for (it was expensive, but the BEST food we had since coming to Singapore).

Maxwell is decent, but take your time to find a place to sit and walk around before buying food."
,,Authentic cheap food,5.0,,If you want the best authentic food in Singapore then you must visit the Maxwell food centre. They have a range of cuisines from different countries and are the cheapest in town. I visited this place every day of our holiday and was never disappointed.
,,Must visit,4.0,,"Maxwell food center is a must visit while in Chinatown , good fresh and cheap food gets a bit crowded around lunch time, with the array of choices you bound to find something to like"
,,Incredible and fun place to eat,5.0,,"We went to Maxwell Food Center twice because it was SO good! There is an incredible selection of food to choose from. We went in search of chicken rice because it was highly recommended to us. It is obvious which food stands are more popular based on the lines seen while walking around. Best advice, try a little of everything as much as you can. We loved the fresh juices, dim sum, chicken rice, etc. Highly recommend."
,,Great place,5.0,,Love it here. Some of the food looks a bit scary for us Western people but it is definitely worth a try.
,,"Amazing plethora of dishes, all so good its hard to restrict oneself",5.0,,"Its not yet lunchtime and already a long snaking queue forms in the centre. The air is heady with the aroma of rice cooked with ginger& garlic and almost every seat in the house is reserved or ‚Äòchopped‚Äô as the locals say- with a packet of tissues or a business card. Singaporean delicacies crowd the tables- chilli crab, chook rice, deep-fried oyster fritters, Hokies mee, ‚Äòcarrot cake‚Äô( cubes of white radish fried in rice flour and served with egg) and Rojak... a legion of chopsticks carve the air."
,,Still affordable price and plenty of good food,4.0,,"The price is still affordable and the quality is good. A wide range of local food to choose from. There is this stall selling oyster "" fried cake"" (some veg, pork and oyster wrap in a layer of crispy batter) is a must eat----- Eat while it's hot."
,,Get amongst the hustle & bustle.,3.0,,"Conveniently located near the hustle and bustle of China towns main attractions. Many stalls were vacant or closed during the Sunday dinner we visited. Still, not a bad choice should you wish to have authentic local food at a cheap price around $3 to $5 per serve. The famous stalls are very busy with long lines, so be prepared to wait or get there early. We were too hungry to wait, so tried other stalls and were still happy. Not as clean as I thought it would be, but overall it was a great dinning experience."
,,Awesome hawker stand food,5.0,,"This is THE best place in Singapore for hawker style food. It‚Äôs close to Chinatown so you can go for a wander after your meal.
Dishes to definitely try - eggs with oyster and laksa
They have pretty good toilets too
Cash machines available but payment is generally in cash

Tip - the food here is better than Lau Pa Sat"
,,Great place to taste local food,5.0,,"The food is fresh, delicious and really cheap. Offers huge variety of chinese and indian authentic meals."
,,"A wide range of Chinese, Malay, Indian and Peranakan food",3.0,,"A large (outdoor) hawker centre with a variety of stalls offering a wide range of Chinese, Malay, Indian and Peranakan food ‚Äî illustrating the diverse cultures of the country. It‚Äôs not air-conditioned (like an indoor food court) but does have fans throughout the area."
,,Fine and cheap local food,4.0,,"Some of the finest local food could be found her , like chicken rice , Teochew porridge and fried sweet dough . Nearby you could find Chinatown hawker centre and there are hundreds of food stalls and a few craft beer stalls to boot."
,,Dinner,4.0,,Had dinner maxwells tonight. Positives food was good Food was cheap Getting there is very easy Lots of tables so we could all sit down Negatives it does need a bit of a clean it did look a bit scuzzy
,,A cheap eat but so tasty,5.0,,You can eat easily for 200 $ a person in Singapore but at Maxwell you get the best and typical Asian dishes without spending more than 5$ for a whole dinner ... There are locals and tourists alike and its safe.
,,"Authentic vibe, fantastic food choices",5.0,,"Fantastic food choices at a great price point (super cheap)!
Must try the tian tian hainanese chicken rice made famous when featured by the late and great Anthony Bourdain (May he rest in peace)
They more than live up to their reputation.
As with all hawker centres you also have various food/drink & sweet stalls available to satisfy any craving so be sure to come with an empty stomach!
I actually prefer this centre over lau pa sat as it didn‚Äôt have the pushy vendors."
,,Singaporean Hawker Centre - lots of variety,5.0,,"We were staying across the road from Maxwell so we visited almost every day for 1 week!! Lots of variety, many choices, gets very busy during peak times - lunch and dinner. We realised in order to save a seat here while you go order your food - locals would put down a packet of tissues which means the seat is ""reserved""! good idea!
We ate dumplings, rice, noodles, chicken rice, and lots of yummy fruit juices. Must try a traditional hawker centre."
,,Looking for Good Food?,5.0,,"This is it, the Place for affordable Chinese food. The food stalls here are clean and serve you quickly. A lot of people flock in here and so it can get crowded but the food is well worth the effort.

I loved the hainanese chicken rice from here. For S$ 4.5, I had a plate of chicken rice and soup."
,,One of the best hawker centers,5.0,,"Low price for high quality. That is what you‚Äôll find here. Tons of different stalls you can try out!

However, it can get a bit crowded and hot. Every table will be filled at times and sharing the table is a given. Being outside means you‚Äôll feel the humidity and the fans don‚Äôt do much to help. It‚Äôs definitely different then you‚Äôre typical restaurant but that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so unique!"
,,Singaporean hawker food at its finest,5.0,,"There were various hawker food stalls to choose from. Some of the best and most authentic tasting chicken rice can be found there. Get some popiah, wanton noodles, oyster cake, and carrot cake. Wash it all off with refreshing sugarcane juice, milk tea, iced coffee or milo dino. Everything was relatively cheap too."
,,Something For Everyone,5.0,,"Always love the food here. Lots of choices, lots to pick from. There is something for everyone. Fantastic Chicken Rice, Wanton noodle, Hokkien Fried Noodles, Fish Ball Soup, Char Kueh Teow, Carrot Cake and western style steak and BBQ - the list goes on. I could visit multiple times and still have not tried all. Yummy!"
,,Maxwell food center,4.0,,Quality of food is ok Prices are really low! Variety is wonderful Atmosphere is ... well junk food like
,,"Accessible, convenient and clean",5.0,,"One of the most tourist friendly hawker center. Good variety of food, well served and moderately priced. Easily accessible from Little India, close to the Buddha Tooth temple. Should give it a try!"
,,Fantastic handmade dumplings at Tim-Sum,5.0,,Visited maxwell around 8pm looking for some dumplings and were so lucky to find Special Shanghai Tim-Sum. The stall appeared to be run by a group of wonderful ladies and we could see them hand-making food in the back. 8 pieces of steam dumplings were absolutely delicious and reasonably priced at $4 SGD.
,,A lovely lunch,4.0,,"After visiting the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple my two daughters and I walked over to Maxwell Food Centre. It is a huge area with lots of little eateries to choose from. We went to Lad and Dad and had fish, chips and peas which was absolutely beautiful. We sat at little tables on a type of stool and the whole place was very busy. If we were staying closer, we would certainly go back."
,,Quieter at dinner time!,5.0,,Maxwell food centre made up the bulk of our meal times in Singapore. On our first night we tried Tian Tian chicken and rice which was great. We fell in love with the yellow fronted stall a few doors down that sold wanton Mee! The couple who own it are lovely. Alcohol is kind of pricey here compared to getting some from the 7/11 but one of the guys who sells it (around tian tian) is very charismatic albeit hectic! The place is clean thanks to the wonderful aunties and uncles who collect plates and there are toilets too (not sure about the condition as I didn‚Äôt use them). It‚Äôs fun going in with a $10 note and seeing how much you can get out of it!
,,Hawker -Maxwell Food Center close to Chinatown,4.0,,Good place to eat specially after visiting Chinatown. You can get all kinds of different Asian foods and desserts for less than $10
,,Great food selection but be prepared to queue,5.0,,"We ate twice in this food court and also popped in several times for a drink. A large beer costs 5-7 Singapore dollars which is much cheaper than bars or hotels. A Cola or Sprite can was 1 $ for a tin as opposed to 10 $ from our hotel minibar, Food was excellent although be prepared to queue at some of the more popular outlets at main meal times, such as the chicken rice outlet or the stall selling roasted meats, especially delicious roasted duck. Main course meals ranged from 3-8 $ depending on what you ordered and if you ordered a large serving to share. Sit where you like to eat your food - tables kept clean with vacated tables quickly cleared by the staff. You buy drinks from specific outlets rather than at the same stall where you buy your food. Put condiments on your food at the time of purchase as none available on the tables. Lots of locals buy food in cartons to take home or to the office to eat."
,,"Amazing range of food choices, cheap and good. A great hawker experience",5.0,,"Maxwell was recommended to us by regular visitors to Singapore from Malaysia and it didn't disappoint. There was a queue for the stall we wanted (Tien Tien Chicken Rice) so whilst one queued another went to get beer and the third grabbed a table. Whilst there is no table service the chap from the beer stall helped me with the beers and chilled glasses back to the table and the food arrived quickly too. The Chicken Rice was very good and fantastic value at about S$3.5 (¬£2) each, beer wasn't expensive either. It was a first hawker experience, and inspired us to ensure it wasn't our last. And the toilets were clean."
,,Amazing variety of Singaporean entrees,5.0,,"We departed Chinatown Food Street onto Bridge St. for a short walk to the Maxwell Food Centre, know as a Hawker Center. On the way you will pass the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, reknowned for the tooth relic of Buddha. The Maxwell hawker food center is a hugh collection of Asian and Singaporian foods. It is like an airplane hanger food court. We tried a number of food entrees including the famous Hainanese chicken. It is hard to know what to recommend, the food was all so good and authentic. Prices were very reasonable and plenty of beer, including Singapore's Tiger beer. Plenty of souvenir shops as well."
,,Part of the Singapore Experince,4.0,,"It would be a real sin to visit Singapore and not try the food in at least one food court. The Maxwell Food Centre is a classic and despite some disruption with local road works is definitely worth including. Very simple format, have a look round the stalls, bagsy a table and then order what you fancy. Most food pretty good but queues tend to be a good sign!"
,,Perfect place when eating on a budget in Singapore.,5.0,,"It's difficult to choose from the variety of dishes from the different food stalls in this hawker market. Great quality at affordable prices. Ok, so table service is non existent, but where else can you eat such tasty dishes at these prices?
Look out for the queues of locals to find the best stalls."
,,A must-visit,5.0,,"The Hainanse Chicken Rice at Tian Tian was high on my list of things to try on my trip to Singapore. I knew the line could be a little long, so I arrived a little early for lunch around 10:30. The mine moved quick and I had my food within 10-15 minutes. I ordered the chicken rice (and spicy sauce) with vegetables. The chicken was tender, moist and flavourful. From another stall, I picked up a refreshing, fresh-pressed sugar cane juice. I was able to find a spot a table to sit fairly easily. On my way out, I grabbed some chilled soy bean curd for dessert, which tasted a lot better than it sounded."
,,Hainanese Chicken Deliciousness,5.0,,"We enjoyed a fabulous dinner here, cheap, excellent flavour and freshness. The best local food we ate! The Hainanese chicken and Kai Lan were delicious."
,,Awesome Food Hawkers,5.0,,Wow! This place is fantastic! A huge selection of authentic foods and at a very cheap price. One of mu favourite Hawker Markets to eat at.
,,"Great variety of great value food, served fast.",4.0,,"The open air, roofed kiosk with a variety of foods, including Malaysian, Muslim, Chinese and Singaporean specialties, is kept clean and service is fast. I had a small Hainanese chicken dish for about $3.50, and a fresh coconut to drink. Tables were cleaned promptly and the only issue was having to choose only what I could manage to eat."
,,Great place,5.0,,Awesome food and service. Loved it. Lots of choice and cheap beer. Also liked the atmosphere. Everyone friendly.
,,Favorite Hawker Center,5.0,,"Even though I had Amoy closer to where I was staying, I would always find myself walking to Maxwell (the People's Park pathway was a nice connection to here) for my meals whether it be brunch, lunch or dinner!
There's something here for whatever you're craving!

I've tried so many things!

-fu zhou oyster pancake: good amount of oysters. Do eat it when it's fresh. Was not a fan of the cilantro addition though. For some reason I had expected it to be crispier?

-almond pudding: DELICIOUS! Must get. Who knew almond pudding could taste so divine? Perfect way to cool down on a hot day for sure. If only I knew it would be so good I would've tried their tofu puddings too but alas I only found this place on my last day.

-tian tian hainese chicken rice: no wonder there's a line at this place during lunch! The chicken was alright but the rice is where it really shines!

-hainese chicken rice (from another stall): there's something magical about the rice of chicken rice (more so than the chicken). It's on the same level as my grandma's chicken.

-cheap pancake thing: it's less than 1 sgd so I got it. The lady was kind of nasty while I was asking about which flavors were available though...so I got red bean. It was passable. I wouldn't get it again...it's basically rice cake.

-soursop juice: one of my best food discoveries during my trip! it tastes like a strawberry and pineapple hybrid! Its flesh was sort of like a tougher version of dragon fruit meets lychee? I wish I could try it again

The only things I'm sad about missing out on are: the rickshaw noodles and the curry hainese rice. Every time I went they were closed unfortunately...if I visit again I'll make sure to make more time to try out more of the stalls here!

I don't know about the bathrooms though as this center is quite old...

There's also a lot of signs around promoting reduction of food waste...so I guess that means if you know you won't be able to finish all your food it's okay to ask for less! I do wonder if stall vendors would give you a discount or something for asking for less food (like less rice) though..."
,,Our favourite hawker centre in singapore,5.0,,We always return here when visiting Singapore! The food is always fantastic! It gets very busy and very hot at lunchtimes but the food is amazing! All local and a wide range of drinks available.
,,This is Singapore!,5.0,,"This was perhaps the best Singapore experience that I had on a recent trip to the city. The restaurants in the Maxwell Food Centre are many and varied. Fresh produce cooked well and utterly delicious.
A bowl of laksa is probably one of the best dishes on offer and at $4 is also one of the cheapest.
The surroundings are very basic and the seating arrangement is adhoc but I think it all adds to the experience."
,,So yummy I had to come back for more,5.0,,"This was such an experience for me as I really dislike food courts. I was so impressed with the cleanliness, cost and taste. I wasn‚Äôt able to try everything I wanted, but it was so good, I had to come back. Able to eat the chicken rice from 2 different stalls. Anthony Bourdain was right to recommend. I am dreaming about it now."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"It was great to visit and experience it. The food was quite nice, especially the chicken and rice dish. A bit crowded and difficult to find a table."
,,Just So-so!,3.0,,"Not as good as expected, minimal stalls open...I expected more especially since the Chinatown complex is closed for renovations! Tian Tian chicken rice stand is the main attraction!"
,,Food is really good.,4.0,,We went to the Maxwell Food Center specially for Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice a michelin star food stall. The hype is true really amazing Chicken Rice gets crazy busy had to wait half an hour in line but was worth it. The Hawker Centre is decent not the best in my view but pretty good cheap options. We walked from Chinatown MRT it took us about 15 mins. If you wanna try the best Chicken and Rice this is the place to visit.
,,A Singapore experience - great inexpensive lunch,5.0,,"We stopped here on a Sunday for a classic Singapore lunch: Hainanese chicken, which is simply chicken poached in a lightly spiced chicken broth, served with rice and a light soup. It was great. Because it was Sunday, many of the hawkers were closed, which made it easier to find seats. Highly recommended."
,,Variety of local hawker foods at reasonable prices,4.0,,"Highly recommendable place to have local hawker foods.
Notes to foreign visitors: if you see a packet of tissue paper or business card or umbrella or..... at lunch hours during work days (Monday - Friday), it only means seat reserved!
After food, you could cross the road to Chinatown or URA gallery too."
,,Good Hawker Center,4.0,,"Even though a lot of places were closed on a Sunday afternoon, we were able to sample a couple of decent dishes.

The stingray from joy feast was really tasty and we really enjoyed the fried dumplings from Special Shanghai Tim-Sum. Also had cold craft beers from 3rd Culture Brewing Co that were really good.

Would return on a busier day if possible."
,,Delicious Food. Cheap Too.,5.0,,"This bustling hawker centre is in the middle of Singapore's business district, and there's plenty of good, local food on offer. Join the lunchtime throng of local office workers for a set plate of duck, tian tian chicken rice, or whatever takes your fancy. It will cost you around the same as an ice cream in an upscale cafe. We went for nyonya food (yum!) at a cost of $6 per plate, followed by super fresh slices of papaya and pineapple for a dollar a pop. A slice of real Singapore and super tasty too!"
,,Very nice local fare,4.0,,"This is a typical hawker centre in Singapore. As a result of its location, within the central business district, it‚Äôs packed to the brim during the lunch hours. As such, do try to visit at 11am or after 1pm to get a good seat.

Lots of typical local food on offer here. You can find the famous chicken rice, your Hong Kong roast meats, etc here.

Economical and good tasting!"
,,Excellent roast duck,4.0,,"Excellent hawker market. I had roast duck, but a wide range of foods on offer. Very good value, and well worth a visit."
,,Tian tian,3.0,,Still bustling at 2pm . Loads of local variety with maxwell‚Äôs claim to fame - tian tian chicken rice. Other stalls are ok to try too
,,Wonderfull Yummy Yummy Stall37,5.0,,"Black Pepper Chicken Noodle (nr6) is the best food I had in Singapore, its a bit spicy but good flavour. highly recommended!! friendly stall owner very friendly as well!!"
,,Its expensive but cheap,3.0,,"Ok so Singapore is not a cheap country. If you go out to a restaurant you will end up paying around 10-20 dollars for a dish. Here it is around 5-10.

For a beginner the place is a bit frightening due to all the kaos. But don‚Äôt worry just go to a stall and order. Pay when you get your food and go sit down. Don‚Äôt worry about getting your own table just sit down where it is a free seat.

It might be hard for vegetarians to find decent food here but most stalls can make something vegetarian. I highly recommend foreigners from the west (like me) to go on a all vegetarian diet during your adventures in Asia (this will cut down the likelihood of being sick greatly)

Make sure to wash your hands before and keep your fingers away from your mouth. food and other surfaces to a avoid getting sick. Actually wash your hands after also, just to be safe."
,,Large hawker centre,4.0,,"There are a lot of food and drinks choices in Maxwell‚Äôs.

The prices are very reasonable so you can try a lot of dishes. We particularly liked the fresh fruit/ vegetable drinks from a stall half way along the right hand side. (only sells drinks)

Strawberry + banana + milk was yummy and only $3 for a large."
,,Foodies paradise,3.0,,"All the street hawker can be found here at night, a foodies paradise. All the food we ate was well cooked and presented. Very busy and cheap feeds"
,,Hawker Food Stalls In Pre-War Shophouses,3.0,,This is a very larg place with numerous hawker food stalls and if you cannot find what you are looking for in local food here it probably dos not exist.It is an interesting and fun place to visit.
,,"Great visit, tasty food",5.0,,"Our first experience of a hawker centre and we were not disappointed!

The food was fantastic and so so cheap
Was great to see the vendor traditionally serving it to you

We had hainanese chicken rice and it was soo tasty! The stall next door was selling my favourite soft drink too, grape Fanta!

Lovely meal and the setting was definitely a great experience!"
,,Great food & great prices,5.0,,"Great place to eat when touring China Town. Prices are good , food is tasty and a quick meal. Local cuisine. The Chicken Rice is great."
,,Fabulous authentic local food,5.0,,This was a place I really wanted to get to during my short time in Singapore and it didn't disappoint. The choice is overwhelming so we tried a couple of stalls. First the famous hainese chicken rice. I split a SGD5 dollar portion with my husband and it was lovely. Everything comes with a broth so don't be surprised. Just enjoy. Sour Sop smoothies are highly recommended. The cups are huge and I think were SGD2 dollars. Then for our third stall where we had a superb Laksa and a noodles and dumplings dish. Unlike the previous stall it was just Chinese spoons and chopsticks on offer. The lovely local gent who kindly shared his table with us was keen to teach me the dark art. I failed miserably but you can't win them all. All in all we had a great time mingling in real street life. It was a shame it was a flying visit but I hope to go back again soon.
,,best hawker center in singapore,4.0,,"i recommend you watch anthony bourdain and mike chen's strickly dumpling before you visit this place just to give you an idea what and where to eat here.
the tien tien haianese chicken rice made famous by anthony bourdain taste like our tinola but i still highly recommend it.
if you still dont know what to order, each stalls have signs that tell you which is singapore best food.
be kind and share table to fellow tourists. clean as you go"
,,Very Hard to Find a Seat During the Busy Lunch Hour,4.0,,"It was my first experience having lunch at a Hawker center, and this one was just across the street from Chinatown. We came here for the very famous Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice Stand. You can easily find this stand in the back of the center with the blue sign and undoubtedly the longest line. From the time we stood at the back of the line until we received our chicken it was about 15 minutes. Then it was hard to find two seats together. We should have done what the locals do, find a seat at one of the tables before you order and reserve it with a small package of tissues. They call this chopping your seat! This is a custom that is respected, so if a seat is chopped already, do not sit there. As is also common, you would go to a different stand to get your drink. It was a fun experience, and next time I will chop a seat first."
,,"Good variety, good quality.",5.0,,"Good wanton noodles and rojak from these two stalls! The wanton noodle may look like a very small portion, but that's because I requested it. TBH, the rojak was very small plate for $3, +$1 of You Tiao. The amount of ingredients were not worth it, but the taste made up for it.

Thoroughly enjoyed the food. Not to mention the chicken rice and porridge are also the popular dishes here."
,,Great for Authentic and Quick Cheap Eats,4.0,,"This like a densely packed food court of authentic foods, snacks and desserts. Everyone in our group tried something different. I had the traditional curry laksa, husband and friends tried some stir fry's, all from different vendors. We also tried some snacks and juice smoothies afterwards at some of the other vendors. All of the food was good, tasted very authentic, was very well priced, and super quick. Tables are a little hard to find when it's busy, they have far more booths than tables. But we were able to share a table with another couple, you just need to keep your eyes peeled and jump on something when you see it. This is the type of place to try some new dishes that you're not used to! I think it's a perfect place for a quick lunch if you're in the area."
,,All about the Hainese Chicken Rice / cheap food option for Singapore,4.0,,"Maxwell Food Centre has heaps of food stalls under one roof, with its speciality being Hainese Chicken Rice (these stalls are easy to spot as they'll be the ones with long queues). There are three four lanes of food stalls and it is always very busy (so it can be hard to get tables sometimes). Compared to neighbouring restaurants, the food here is chap for Singapore (most dishes 3 to 4 SGD)."
,,"Easy way to sample the traditional, local delights of Singapore.",5.0,,"Regardless of budget, you'll get fed very well here. Australians/Westerners may find the experience a bit confronting, but the food court is very clean and well maintained. You may just have to share a table with other people as it can get busy. Some stalls are very popular such as the Tien Tien Chicken Rice so you may be waiting 30 minutes or more for some dishes. Other places are less busy but still very good. Most dishes are under 10 SGD."
,,Local food,4.0,,This eating place has every local dish at reasonable price. It is neat and clean place to enjoy any kind of meals and drinks. It is near Buddha Tooth Relic temple so after visiting the temple we went here to enjoy best Thai food. Read more about this place in the picture attached.
,,Great local food joint,4.0,,"Excellent variety and not too touristy.

Top: Check the times though, we went around 3pm on a Saturday and about half the stalls were closed. That said, there was still plenty of variety with the other half.

The hawker centre is clean and open (with roof only. Can be quite hot in summed.

Not to miss is Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken (see review)."
,,SISAKET Thai Food,5.0,,"Bestes Thai food am street food market "" Maxwell"" ... Besonders empfehlenswert: Thai Mango Salad, Kangkong Thai Style und veg.green Curry üòã"
,,Forget the tourist traps.,5.0,,"Any year now Singapore will have an MRT station at Maxwell but for now it's a short walk from the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple or a bus ride from Raffles City. Sorry, no air conditioning but wall to wall food local style. My favourite is an unassuming dim sum outlet."
,,Not tasty food,2.0,,"Food wasn‚Äôt tasty. We tried Korean, Chinese and 2 shakes Couldn‚Äôt finish it too greasy Also they don‚Äôt give tissues and ask you to go to market to buy it Cutlery and table not clean Overall disappointed"
,,Tien tien hainan chicken,4.0,,"This is a must for anyone who loves hainan chicken. Tien tien is at this maxwell hawker Center and the chicken is tender and flavorful. Chicken rice is very yummy as well. Very reasonably priced. Try the fruit juices across the aisle too. There are bbq items throughout, we didn‚Äôt try but looks pretty good."
,,Great food at good price,4.0,,Reasonably priced and decent food . Relaxed atmosphere. I would give 5 stars but lacks a decent breakfast offering .
,,Great variety of food,4.0,,A nice atmosphere. Very crowded at lunch time. Food quality is high with many stalls ranked A and with specialities for some kind of food. Seafood fried rice is a must!!!
,,Cheap and local food,5.0,,"If you are looking for some cheap and local food, this is one of the places to go. The food is great and you can't beat the price. Must try the Satay. We also took fresh drinks, like sugar cane and mango juice. You can see how it's made in front of you from a fresh fruits."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"Delicious local food at this fantastic hawker centre. Lots of locals, very affordable and authentic food :)"
,,Be aware - good and bad,3.0,,"Firstly, this is a good place for a variety of affordable options. My and my partner went there and had good food and very reasonable prices but then there are hawkers that con tourists and one which to watch out for is Joyfeast. At first he claims great dishes at affordable prices like my duck dish, which i didn't notice but had 8 Sgd on one side and asked for, also had 18 and 22 on the other side; which isn't visible. So as most if not all hawker stalls here aim there meals around 4-8 Singaporean dollars, you don't much notice and then my other half ordered a singaporean crab special.

Let me tell you there was nothing special in fact there was hardly any meat and just hidden under a tonne of sauce. Also the crab had a price but then was blacked out. Finally when we came to pay we had one rice bowl short but as thr 2 previous days were expecting 8 + at most another 8-10 dollars but the bill came to 54 Sgd!!! When I went to question it, he became angry and so my other half just said to pay, as there were other customers waiting and so we did. On top of all this the duck was horrible and my other half hardly had any meat but just a sauce based dish. So please stay away from these people.

Other than that horrible moment, the other times were really good and so, please ask the price and perhaps pay upfront to avoid situations like ours. Happy travels"
,,"Good food, big choice",4.0,,"A really good hawker centre. There is plenty to choose from with different food, mostly local dishes that are freshly cooked. Very busy and good atmosphere."
,,"A Wonderful food court with ""Diverse cuisines""!",4.0,,"This a ""sort of Haven"" for ""Food Lovers""! This ""Food Centre"" was originally a ""wet Market"" and started about 70 years ago. It gradually allowed stalls to sell prepared food. The individual stalls provide many delicious Singaporean specialities as well as examples of ""culinary treasures"" from most of the countries in Southeast Asia!! The costs are ""reasonable to quite inexpensive"", while the quality if very high [due to the competition between the food stall owners. Many locals [from all socio-economic groups] also visit the Food Centre on a regular basis-- and this also adds pressure on the various owners to keep quality (and health) standards very high!! Travellers visiting Singapore will be delighted after visiting and eating here-- and will probably return!!

I hope that this Review has been helpful."
,,Variety and Flavors,4.0,,Reminds of the food courts in the Philippines. Eventhough I am living here in SG; I make to it that I dine here at least once a week. Very affordable prices and if I am not doing weight control; I would like to eat here every other day!!!!
,,Cheap food,5.0,,"A must visit for extremely cheap, delicious food. Located in Chinatown and easily accessed from the MRT. A must visit, try the tian tian chicken rice stall, delicious. Look out for A rated stalls! I‚Äôd recommend trying the duck stall too, in my pictures, the green one. Very tasty and always has a huge line."
,,Ultimate destination for foodies,5.0,,"If anyone claims they love Asian food and didn't stop here while in Singapore, then they have missed the whole purpose in life for enjoying great food at very very reasonable prices. Talk about so many choices, where to start? look for a long que of locals in front of a stall is one way. Some visitors may be concern about outdoor food vendors - fear not, Singapore has a strong reputation about cleanliness and food safety."
,,Worth a Trip over Just to Experience It,4.0,,"Headed to Chinatown from our hotel (Ritz) and got to see some beautiful sites on the way. Destination was the Maxwell Food Centre and the famous Chicken Rice dish. Found the Centre fairly easily, they do have signs to help. Got there a little before time for half of the stations to open, but the one we were targeting was ready to go. Go to the one with the longest line, it's always the best and you can reserve a table with a napkin or bag or something and folks will leave it alone. The Chicken Rice dish is served at room temperature (this surprised us a little bit) so be prepared. We had Singapore dollars that we had gotten from an ATM (which they also have available there). There are restrooms, so no worries about that. It's a little warm, but not too bad. You need to at least do it once!"
,,Cheap local food,4.0,,"If you want some cheap and local food, this is one of the places to go. Lineups for the popular stalls can get quite long but the food is great and you can't beat the price. Hainanese chicken is a definite must try. A lot of other good fresh drinks, like sugar cane and coconut juice."
,,Where the locals go,5.0,,This is one of many Hawker centres in Singapore and it comprises many individual food shops in an undercover area. We ate there several times and all the food was absolutely delicious and cheap. The variety of food is extensive and of very good quality. I decided to try one of the local desserts called Chendal - a very cold sweet dessert which was exquisite on a hot steamy day - must try it. Can get quite busy at times.
,,Authentic Asian food!,5.0,,"Delicious, cheap variety of food. Any food court in Singapore is a wonderful experience. We never at anywhere else. The people at the food stalls work so hard in the heat and bustle--truly inspiring. Don't forget to try the local icy cold drinks and desserts. Ice kachong is such a treat!!"
,,Cheap and yummy lunch!,4.0,,"We came here on a Sunday at around 11 am and were able to get food quickly (barely any queues). We also had no trouble finding a table to ourselves and didn't need to use issue packs to reserve seats. Half the stalls were not open but the more popular ones (i.e. Tian Tian Hainese Chicken Rice) were open. By the time we left around 11:45 am, there were no open tables and queues were starting to snake. We got a medium chicken rice from Tian Tian, a black carrot cake, a white carrot cake, two cans of soft drink, and a soya drink for $15 SGD!!! The carrot cakes were pretty large portions. Left stuffed and didn't feel like eating again until around 7 PM. Definitely worth a visit if you are in the Chinatown area. We are thinking about coming back again while we are here to try out more dishes!"
,,Hainanese Chicken,5.0,,"Best place for Hainanese Chicken Rice lover,, You can try Tian Tian best food, best place, you will love it"
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,This a a great hawker centre with a lot of variety of authentic dishes. Cheap and cheerful and very busy. Get there early to get a table
,,"Very local food , charming but not everyone‚Äôs taste",3.0,,"We tried different local dishes , inspired by local newspaper reports which were attached at the foodstall. Owners were friendly , locAl, food was tasty and not overpriced, worth a visit if you do not mind hawker atmosphere, I am sure there are better places"
,,"Joyfeast at Maxwell food centre Singapore, good but very pricey!",4.0,,"On the 1st January 2019, I went to Maxwell Food Centre in Singapore for the first time and had Black Pepper Crab at Joyfeast stall.
The crab was tasty, I love pepper and spicy food a lot. But the price was really high, I payed 45 !! Singapore dollars for one portion! Just to compare, later I went to Japanese restaurant in Marina Mall and they had crab for 14 Singapore dollars a portion only!"
,,Authentic and good value but quality varies,4.0,,"The Maxwell centre was on our must-see list and we made the trek there on a hot sunny afternoon. On the whole, the centre did not disappoint. It is an authentic hawker centre with a dazzle variety of food stalls including some very famous ones. Most are excellent in quality and value but there are the odd ones that are a bit so-so."
,,Nice,4.0,,Fairly clean and well kept up with lots of different food options. My husband loved it. As a vegetarian I had a bit harder time but I fell in love with the stall that sold fresh fruit juices . :)
,,Fantastic food,5.0,,"Low key food market with great cheap food, heaps of stalls! Also cheap beer even Erdinger Hefeweizen!"
,,"Brilliant range, brilliant food and brilliant price",5.0,,"This place is full of locals. That‚Äôs always a good sign. There is a ludicrous range of food options including some western options if you are travelling with an unadventurous child.

This is a must do in Singapore. It touches the edge of China Town so fits in well with a visit there."
,,Not everything is Tian Tian,5.0,,"Let me preface this with saying that having tried Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken, Anthony Bourdain was tight. It is fricking incredible. The chicken is soft and well seasoned, the chilli is hot but not remember in the morning hot and the rice is fluffy and delicious. So the lines to try it are no surprise.
BUT
There is a lot more to Maxwell than Tian Tian. Due to being unlucky and having poor time management skills, I‚Äôve had more meals with other stalls than with them. The food is routinely delicious! The best thing to do is the usual. Look for a line and join it. Oh and bring your tissue packet so you can reserve a spot, this place is BUSY!"
,,Silver hammer not needed to get a good feed!,5.0,,"Located in Chinatown, across the street from the iconic Buddhist Temple on the corner of Maxwell and South Bridge road. Its pretty hard not to get a good meal here, unless you choose something you don‚Äôt like to begin with. If you don‚Äôt have a plan, come early to check out the stalls before they get busy, then choose a stall with an early line up (‚ÄúQ‚Äù) of locals. This Hawker centre is famous for Hainanese (Wengchang) Chicken and Rice, but don‚Äôt let that limit your choices. You‚Äôll be back for more anyway!"
,,Cheap and good variety,4.0,,"One of my fave hawker centres in Singapore. Good variety but like all food centres, some stalls are better than others. Tian tian chicken rice is worth trying and the Lao Ban soya beancurd dessert was a highlight. Some of the other food is a bit average... At least the food is cheap"
,,Busy hawker centre with some superstar stalls,4.0,,"This ground floor hawker centre is a fair distance from the nearest MRT station with Chinatown MRT being the closest 600 metre away. Being a long established centre there are some superstar stalls evidenced by the long queues even before midday, in some cases people start queuing before the stalls opens.

Seating are at the circular tables and chairs all fixed to the floor so be prepared to share with strangers. Stalls had good variety of dishes with many types of cuisines catered for and there are several fresh juice bars to keep prices competitive. Whilst not wanting to wait 30 minutes or more at the popular stalls, my chosen dishes here were all of a high standard but I feel the ones from the stalls the nearby Chinatown Complex were better."
,,Chicken and Rice! Why else did I come here?,5.0,,Main reason I went to Maxwell Food Centre was because of Chicken and Rice. After seeing numerous reviews and youtube foodie videos all that have traveled to Singapore all ended up here for the famous Tian Tian Chicken and Rice. There were other standard options just like any other hawker center in Singapore.
,,Cheap Eats,5.0,,"Great place to grab some inexpensive and authentic food in Singapore. There are many food stalls that offer a great variety of mostly Chinese food, all at reasonable prices. It gets very busy at lunchtime with locals lining up for the best dishes."
,,A food court of street food,3.0,,"So, instead of wandering the narrow alleyways of Chinatown in search of a bite to eat, you can just come here and find a wide variety of ethnic foods. Unfortunately, we came the day after Christmas and half or more of the stands were closed. It was also nearly 90 degrees and we would have preferred some A/C. If you aren‚Äôt overly adventurous, stick with the chicken and rice and you won‚Äôt go wrong. Cheap too!"
,,Fantastic food. Fantastic people. Fantastic price..,5.0,,"Found in Chinatown District.. but get a taxi to it is easy at first.. we ate here several times.. and the beer is cheaper too.. so good all round for value.
The best belly pork I have ever had for a plate with rice and soy sauce for $2. Amazing. The people are so nice too. We celebrated Christmas Eve with them and had such a good evening.. highly recommend these two stalls for your food and your drink. You won‚Äôt be disappointed.. Belly Pork is a must.. but get there early about 6pm as he sells out so quick.. once you‚Äôve been I guarantee you will be back.. enjoy."
,,Definition of good asian food,4.0,,"We have tasted Hainanese chicken rice all over the world, Maxwell food center gave us the highest satisfaction, tender but still chewy of freshly cooked chicken meat, thin skin with no visible underlining fat, rice steamed in chicken broth you know at first spoon its perfectly cooked."
,,Plenty of Options,5.0,,I ate here twice on my trip and both times the food was excellent! I highly recommend Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice.
,,‚ÄúCHEAP FOOD‚Äù,2.0,,I think that you get what you pay for. The food is cheap but not of good quality. Great if you just want a drink. ‚Äì Coconut water etc.
,,SPOILT FOR CHOICE !!!,5.0,,Maxwell Food Centre contains dozens of small eateries generally serving a vast range of Asian cuisines. I had a magnificent chicken curry and a large ice-cold fruit juice for $S7. Service is attentive with a smile. Very enjoyable !
,,Foodies dream,5.0,,"About ten minutes walk from Chinatown. The venue is in a large open air shed. Nothing fancy but seems to be a local favourite. Lots of people however we managed to grab a table fairly quickly as movement is quite fast thought expect to share with others.

Plenty of choices. Mostly around $5 SGD. Portions are not big. We had about 6 dishes and 2 drinks between 2 and spent less than $30 SGD.

We tried the Hainanese Chicken at both Ai Tai and Michelin famous Tian Tian. Both are very tasty and the rice is very fragrant at both locations. Prefer the sauce offered at Ai Tai slightly more especially the chilli sauce. However the chicken meat is slightly superior at Tender. Despite it being breast meat, it is impossibly tender and moist. However Ai Tai‚Äòs chicken is great also. Tian Tian also doesn‚Äôt have chicken soup, so the meal doesn‚Äôt feel complete.

Also tried laksa, oyster cake, fish soup, fried mwah teow. All were very tasty and authentic. Service was very fast, less than 5 minute wait. We were very hungry so sorry no food photos.

Truly a foodies paradise."
,,Excellent food and authenticity,5.0,,"This is an iconic hawker centre. There are not a lot of tourists here, seems to be locals. Sure, their is the famous chicken rice stall but there are a lot of other excellent places also. This is a good place for breakfast - try the Kaya toast, which we did and it was cheap and tasty. This is a good option for other meals too - we had the chicken rice from one of the other stalls. There are many good food stalls to explore. Great drinks too."
,,Great hawker centre,5.0,,"A must visit. An easy walk from our hotel, we were pleasantly surprised when we got there at around 8/8.30pm. Plenty of stalls still open although some of the more popular ones had run out of food and closed before we arrived. We got hainese chicken and rice and a few beers and sat amongst residents and tourists. Also has atms which is useful!"
,,Chicken and rice,4.0,,A must visit Hawker center. The chicken and rice is good. Tried both stalls one with Anthony Bourdains recommendation or face on it. And the one next to it. I preferred the one next to it. The one with his name the working yelled at me because I had two spoons. I explained to him that I had two people that were going to eat. The food and customer service was better at the stall next to this one.
,,Another good hawcker centre,4.0,,This is another good hawcker centre in the downtown area of S'pore. Very clean and lots of different and reasonably priced food from across the region. Definately go there if in the Chinatown area.
,,Try Lad and Dad at Maxwell,5.0,,Try their butty $5 and $10 beef stew! Superb and tasty! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Maybe salty for some on the butty because of bacon as well. Just tell them less salt will do. üëç
,,Hawker Centers the reason I came to Singapore,5.0,,"Anthony Bourdain. RIP. Fans try to roust the heat and humidity. Bathroom is acceptable. Not luxe. B y o napkins! Prices basically 3 dollars US ( 4 Singapore ) delicious stir fries. Share a table. The more people, the more you can taste."
,,Overwhelming number of food choices at low prices!,4.0,,"The advantage of working so close to Maxwell Food Centre is that I get to save a lot on my lunch budget during the week. My only complaints - and they're not really complaints, TBH - would be that because you are literally faced with an array of choices, you sometimes end up wandering around looking for something to satisfy your hunger/craving. My favourites are the Thai stall at the back (the lunch sets are fantastic!), the western salad shop (healthy, cheap, and great value for money), and the kopi uncle who supplies my morning kopi. Expect queue in some of 'famous' stalls - like the chicken rice shop - during lunch break, so be early if you can."
,,Good cheap hawker food but crowded,3.0,,"This is an open air hawker center about the same distance from the Chinatown MRT station, the Outram Park MRT station, theTelok Ayer MRT station, and the Tanjong Payar MRT station. In other words, unless you are in the neighborhood, it is not as convenient as other hawker centers which are located right next to a MRT station. It is open air with a roof overhead to provide shade. Food is good and relatively cheap, but as a result, it is crowded. So finding a table during lunch hours is a challenge especially in the hot and humid Singapore weather. So if you want to save a few bucks for good food, this is a good destination. Otherwise the air-conditioned food courts near the Bedok MRT station and the Bugis MRT station to name a few are more comfortable alternatives."
,,Loved this Hawker Centre,5.0,,"We were staying nearby so ate at Maxwell every night of our stay in Singapore. We travelled with two children aged 8 and 12 who are fussy eaters. They both loved the food at the various stalls here and there was some sensational food to be had at really cheap prices. The few drink stalls here also were super cheap. Highly recommended even if you are not on a budget, this is where the locals come to eat!"
,,Good cheap food.,4.0,,MRT stop very close and walk to street market styled food hall . Very popular and night stalls even busier. Wide selection of food and even get a beer or wine from separate venders. Recommend Dumplings and chicken rice.
,,Goof Place good Variety,4.0,,"Wide selection of stalls and very cheap place to go. We really enjoyed the experience, and the food was lovely."
,,Melting pot of food & beverages,5.0,,"This is one of my favorite hawker centers. Lots of options to choice from, typically very busy so be prepared. It may take a while to find an open table."
,,you have got to try this venue,4.0,,"I was recommended this food centre by a friend of mine who had recently visited Singapore.
The place is clean and tidy and is used by both locals and visitors alike, there is a vast array of food to try at very cheap prices.
I tried various food stalls during the time of my stay in Singapore and would say that the quality of the food was excellent and very fresh.
highly recommended"
,,Fantastic Food,5.0,,"We ate here 3 times during our 10 day stay in Singapore. The food was fresh, tasty & exceptionally well priced. We particularly enjoyed the pork & duck with rice from stall 71 where both the food & service were outstanding. It was a short walk from the China Town MRT station."
,,Lunch is a must,5.0,,We visited the food centre and experienced the hustle bustle at lunch time. We shared a table with some local people while having lunch. We had the famed chicken and rice with a fresh fruit drink. Amazing lunch. Great atmosphere. We all the stalls to learn more about the local food. A cultural experience.
,,You Just Have To Love Singapore Hawker Food,5.0,,"If you want to find cheap and good local Singaporean hawker style food, Maxwell Food Centre is one place that you may want to head to. Loads of different type of food available here. Very near Chinatown and this place can get really busy at times."
,,Very Good Hainanese Chicken!,4.0,,"My wife and I took the hop on/hop off bus to this hawker food center. Friends recommended that we go there and try the Hainanese Chicken Rice at the Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice booth. We took their suggestion and went there just before lunch time. We ordered half a chicken and some veggies to share. The chicken came with a dish of rice cooked in chicken broth. The chicken was very good - probably the best that we had anywhere! The price was also very reasonable. While we were there, we saw other booths offering interesting cuisine. Worthwhile going back if we stayed longer."
,,Great inexpensive local food.,5.0,,"First tume visiting Hawker food in Singapore. Wasnt disappointed, really good inexpensive food. Hainanese chicken rice, laksa, curry, roast meats, tofu pudding for dessert. The most inexpensive foods have long long lines. Worth a try... üëç üëç"
,,Fun and cheap,5.0,,A fun hawker place with good prices. Busy and hot during lunch hour. Worth a visit while in China town.
,,Great food at the Hawker Centre,5.0,,"You will be hard pressed not to find something you will eat. I‚Äôm a vegetarian so signs for fish head soup can be a bit intimidating. Just walk up to stall holders and ask if they do vegetarian...all are happy to help & point you to another stall if it‚Äôs not possible for them to do something. Definitely try the juices...dragon fruit & pineapple is the best smoothie I‚Äôve ever had. Obviously, it being a Hawker Centre, food is amazingly cheap..2 Singapore dollars for a juice and less than five dollars for a main course"
,,food showcase,4.0,,Maxwell Food Centre is a few meters from our hotel. The place is clean and the ventilation is just alright. Almost all Asian cuisines are being offered. Chicken rice is very popular. The prices are reasonable and affordable.
,,Great food but very busy,4.0,,We came here to have something to eat after visiting Chinatown. It is very busy and basically it is a hawker market under cover. It is a free for all regarding the tables and you will probably have to share if there are only a couple of you. You buy your food from whichever vendor you wish and eat it at the tables. We had something from Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice - very nice.
,,My favourite,5.0,,This is my favourite place to eat in Singapore the food is so fresh and delicious and the bonus is it‚Äôs cheap. We come several times during our trips to Singapore. The Hainanese chicken is the best I have ever eaten. Don‚Äôt forget a dessert to finish your meal cendol is delicious ice coconut treat.
,,Still As Good,5.0,,"A Must try Chicken Rice Stall. But lavish others Local High-light worth trying as well. We've tasted Chicken RIce, Laksa and Sugacane Juice this time. ALL meet expectation. THE Chicken Rice stall still Q with people."
,,Great food - a must go to,5.0,,"What more can be said other than a fantastic choice of food and drink and the quality of food was amazing
What‚Äôs more the four of us ate for approx ¬£12 in total
The choices are widespread and the sugar cane juice is not only good to drink but is fascinating to see how the cane is crushed to extract the juice
You simply can‚Äôt go wrong"
,,Try it for a great experience,5.0,,Lots of stalls in this local hawkers market. Used mainly by locals the food and drink is inexpensive. There are lots of different food styles to chose from all cooked fresh for you. Sit with the locals if you wish at the small communal tables. A great place to rub shoulders with the locals and soak up the traditional atmosphere. Everyone is very friendly and helpful. A fun inexpensive experience. Well worth trying.
,,Too many good food,5.0,,"Some might say come for the chicken rice, I say go for the Hainanese Curry Rice. The one with the colorful sign. Not sure what to choose? Just go for the standard dishes like the pork chop, cabbage and egg. I added mine with the fried prawns, braised pork and meat ball. Worth every penny. Wash it down with some sugar cane and you're good to go."
,,Bit expensive for hawker rate,3.0,,We actually want to try their famous Hainan Chicken Rice but it was sold out so we tried the alternative stall. The price was a bit higher than other hawker food complex and the taste was average.
,,Expresso Cafe in the heart of hawker centre,4.0,,"Hangar coffee express.  Maxwell food centre, Singapore. 

Strong barista expresso coffee. Very friendly service.

Good size and good value for S$5

One of the better coffee places in Singapore. Way better than those traditional commercial chain cafes.......

Located in the centre of the 3rd row. V Good western style expresso coffee with local hawker food is a real treat. Best of both worlds."
,,Best ever,5.0,,I‚Äôve been coming to Singapore for many years and never leave this island without enjoying food at this hawker center. Especially the Hainanese Chicken Rice really deserves this honor. Many others are all-in-one here. A real Asian experience.
,,Cheap Food,4.0,,"We visited here after researching on TP & to be honest it wasn‚Äôt half bad, super cheap to any restaurant in Singapore for sure and equally as good. Yes it‚Äôs plastic tables and not somewhere to take a date but if your looking to escape the quayside bars and want a real experience give it a go."
,,Great variety of hawker stalls,4.0,,"Located a short walk from Chinatown station, this centre is well designed, with several aisles of stalls, making it very easy to walk up and down to explore all it had to offer. It was busting busy just after 10am, however easy to find a place to sit. It is easy to also find which stalls to head to, as there are several queues that stand out in the crowd. Tian Tian has been made famous by Anthony Bourdain (a great loss), although there are other Hainanese chicken stalls that rival this venue (Ah Tian for example). Maxwell Fuzhou Oyster Cake is a master of a dying delicacy (crispy and tasty), and Zhou Zhou Porridge does great congee. There are plenty more dishes on offer. Prices are reasonable, bring cash on hand."
,,Nice place to get many different food experiences,5.0,,"Recommend to try Popiah here, a dish specific to Singapore that I absolutely love, but they make a really bad version of it in many touristy places around the town, but here it is good."
,,"Cheap eats, a great way to try everything!",5.0,,"These food centres (previously called Hawker centres, but they don't actually ""hawk"" anymore) are a great way to experience local flavor without having to spend a fortune! There are food centres located all over Singapore, but this one has the famous chicken rice stall with the Michelin star. We tried it and weren't a fan of the cold chicken, but we also got black carrot cake and fresh juices, which were amazing! Would highly recommend checking this, or another one out."
,,Average food centre,3.0,,"This was rated one of the best hawker centres, unfortunately I was not impressed. Not much choice and the quality of the food was very mediocre."
,,Winner winner!,4.0,,"A variety of local and Asian influenced hawker style fare. Plates are in expensive, fresh and there is a large variety of regional dishes to choose from.

I enjoyed the Hainanese Chicken Rice from the famous Tien Tien. Fragrant and delicious to eat on its own.

The Hawker Centre is a must do, when visiting Chinatown, Singapore"
,,Not the best Hawker we experienced in Singapore,3.0,,"We had heard that the Maxwell Food Centre was the food place to go in Chinatown and was our second experience of a Hawker. Unfortunately, as we tended to view the photos and some of the titles as our method of determining whether stalls had food that we would like we were a little put off as some had some unappetising photos, which I know is a little unfair.

Additionally, the Maxwell Food Centre itself did not seem to be the most hygienic food place that we had visited.

Our children chose a chicken and rice dish from a famous stall that had beaten Gordon Ramsey in a food challenge. They seemed to enjoy it but to my eyes, it looked like plain rice and unseasoned chicken.

I chose seafood pad thai and my wife had another seafood dish from the same stall. we both enjoyed our food and I could have quite easily eaten seconds.

The reason I am a little down on the place is that despite there being many stalls to choose from, there seemed to be little choice based on our appetites. Other reviewers will no doubt have different opinions and enjoy the vast selection of offerings.

I would recommend a visit and I would go again as I think I may have been a little unfair. Incidentally, our favourite Hawker was at Viva City which was lovely."
,,Good hawker Centre,4.0,,Good selection here and come to watch all the locals Try and go where there is a queue ! The locals know Had great honey roast pork at mr whites (don‚Äôt know real name ... sorry) he gave himself this nickname Cheap lunchtime food
,,Local food delights await!,5.0,,"Upon the recommendation of a expat local we headed down to experience a wonderful evening of very inexpensive but wonderful local specialties!

A huge variety of options await and as long as you don't expect silver service but instead a much genuine experience this is definitely a place to experience!"
,,Foodie Paradise,5.0,,"A must visit hawker center when visiting Singapore. If you have an appreciation for local flavors this place is a foodies paradise and home to the Tian Tian chicken rice! There is just something about the atmosphere of being surrounded by locals and visitors, sitting down and eating a meal that I just absolutely love. There is a wide variety of food from savory to sweet to choose from. Also be forewarned that it's not in an air conditioned building so feel that south east asia heat and humidity penetrating against your skin.

Located in the heart of Chinatown and walking distance from the Chinatown MRT stop make sure to stop by Maxwell!"

,,Amazing place!,5.0,,We really loved this place!! From the tasty food passing by the coconut water to the price!! Here you can eat traditional dishes at the lowest price! Ps. The sugar cane drink is so niiiice!
,,great value,5.0,,"We arrived a little late as everyone was closing up, but we still got chicken fried rice and a tiger for a great price, and would go again. A travellers must see...."
,,The place of famous hainan chicken rice,5.0,,"Came here by curiousity to try the famous hainan chicken rice, but unfortunetely the hawker stall that I pointed was closed during my visit. Awared that many stalls offers the same dishes - I was following others to queuing at one of the them.

After some minutes in-lining, finally I got what i want; the hainan chicken with jasmine rice.

The taste was great, chicken meat was very tender and tasteful, jasmine rice was also cooked well.

Definetely will coming back to this hawker centre."
,,Singapore Hawked Foods,4.0,,"As a Traveller to any country, one would like to experience the local food cultures of that respective country as part of the places of interests, shopping etc.

Every country have its own food cultures .. like street foods in Bangkok primarily Thai and in Yawarat Thai-Chinese. Street Foods in Vietnam .. primarily Vietnamese.

In Singapore .. the street foods is located at Hawker Centre or Food Centre instead of along the streets as in the olden days Singapore.
In the Hawker's or Foods Centre, one can have 4 local Singaporean cuisine.. Malay, Chinese,Indian and Western foods.
Try the Hainanese Chicken Rice, the Nasi Padang, the Indian Roti Prata and the Western Grilled foods amongst the many different type of other foods like noodle etc. Visiting these foods centre is an adventure itself."
,,Must go for cheap prices and quality meals,5.0,,Must go if you are near Chinatown / Tanjong Pagar stations. Really cheap prices for maximum quality and local food. Opportunity to meet locals and share the meals. The Thai shop is excellent.
,,Cheap and delicius food on offer,5.0,,"The food here is amazingly cheap, it is yummy and you can get beer. Expect lots of people and the tables and general facilities (like toilets) aren't flash, but absolutely no arguments from me on the food front. Tip would be to go to the long lines if you want the best food, it will be worth the wait."
,,Cheap but good food,5.0,,This place looks strange but is perfect for a cheap meal in Singapore. Apparently there are quite a few places like this around the city. Loads of little food shops with so much on offer. We had a great meal
,,"The place was crowded, and had good options",4.0,,The place was crowded and mostly you would hardly find any vegetarian options but the beer options were quite good. There is a good seating area and this place is at a walking distance from Chinatown.
,,Cheap good eats,5.0,,"The best spot for street eats...
I‚Äôve never been disappointed!
You may wonder what some of it actually is, but that‚Äôs all part of being in an area where the locals go to eat lunch isn‚Äôt it. If you can‚Äôt be tempted by the food there are plenty of stalls offering cool drinks and bargain Tiger beers."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,I‚Äôve been coming here since 1994. Still the best taste and value of anywhere I‚Äôve been in Singapore. This is the real deal. Don‚Äôt expect fancy....just very good.
,,Delicious and cheap local food,4.0,,"The Maxwell food market offers a variety of cheap local dining options. The dining culture of Singapore, a combination of Chinese, Malay and Indian, is truly represented here. The prices are very affordable. We visited right after the Chinese New Year and there were some traditional lion dancing performance going on which is really interesting. This is a must-visit for me whenever I am in Singapore."
,,Traditional food court,4.0,,"We came here in late April, and the centre was a bit difficult to find due to building work in the immediate vicinity. But it was still there and thriving, maybe just a little less busy than usual. The work may have finished by now.
This covered food centre offers a plethora of food stalls. Most of them are Chinese, heavy on meat and seafood, so there is not that much choice for vegetarians. However, we ordered veggie murtabak from one of the Indian stalls. It was excellent, but the portions were enormous. We struggled to finish it, and had no room for a dessert. Unless you have a very big appetite one plate is enough for two. Beer is also available.
As you'd expect prices are quite cheap, we paid SGD20 for two murtabaks and a large beer. A food court is something you definitely have to try when in Singapore."
,,Maxwell Food Centre...Michelin Star Chicken and rice at Tian Tian.,1.0,,"Michelin Star Chicken and rice dish at Tian Tian is nothing but a tasteless boiled chicken and rice dish. After seeing it on Getaway, it was a must do experience. We caught a taxi from Clarke Quay to get there, only to be disappointed by this bland meal.The cleanliness of the centre was not pleasant either. The cut up fruit in plastic cups was the only pleasant experience.... so don't rush to go there! There are plenty of eateries around Chin town."
,,Good lunch,4.0,,Ate lunch here whilst visiting Chinatown As you would expect most of the food stalls were Chinese but as an alternative there was a great biryani stall ( S$5 ) and another with excellent Thai green curry. Certain places such as Tian Tian chicken had long queues but most didn‚Äôt and it was easy to get a table at Saturday lunchtime.
,,Chicken rice and more,4.0,,"Like many people, I came here for the chicken rice and it was just okay. There will be a queue already from the moment this place opens. Aside from chicken rice you should try the other foods here also, meals are very cheap. You can get here from Chinatown MRT and walk 10-15 mins."
,,Best value meal,4.0,,"A lot of food shop inside this building, including Tian-Tian chicken rice (very long queue!) or Ah-Tai that I think very close to.
No air condition but not hot, sit anywhere you can find the seat, it‚Äôs food center!!
Cheap meal (compare with other restaurant in Singapore, haha)"
,,Singaporeans' Favourite Food Centre.,5.0,,"Here, you will want to sample the Michelin-starred, Gordon Ramsay-endorsed Tian Tian Chicken Rice, among other local delights. Expect queues at most stalls, though."
,,The best place for foodies.,5.0,,"Amazing tasting foods! A Singapore must go. I had the famous Hainan chicken and rice, and sat with a local couple who were lovely. The locals are friendly, and ask them what is the best eats if you are not sure what to eat first. The juices were amazing. The toilets here were very clean also.
Use it as a springboard for the Buddha tooth temple and Chinatown as they are close by."
,,Amazing Chee Cheong Fun,3.0,,We had lunch at the Maxwell road food centre after a long time. We tried 4 different types of Chee Cheong at the Chee Cheong Fun Club. It tasted fantastic. We also had the Thian Thian chicken rice which we find nothing extra ordinary. It still had long lines at 3pm.
,,Best Hainanese chicken rice in Singapore,5.0,,"Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice at Maxewell Food Center is absolutely the best in Singapore by far you simply have to try it, oddly its not touristy at all despite being next to Chinatown. It's where I go everytime I'm in town"
,,Excellent spot for lunch at a reasonable cost,4.0,,"We went here from Chinatown. It felt like a more genuine place to eat with lots of locals as well as tourists. The costs was very reasonable. We had steamed dumplings from Special Shanghai Tim-Sum which were amazing and a noodle dish from Spinach and Soup which was very tasty as well.

Our only negative was with other people visiting who appeared incapable of clearing their table despite the 100s of signs asking you to."
,,You mst go,5.0,,"Hacker food small stalls communal eating but sensational food at great prices. Wish we had found this earlier. I remember Newtons circus from the early 1980s, now a tourist trap. This is the next best thing"
,,More than expectation,5.0,,"I have to sat that I have difficult taste about fried rice, but here I had one of the best fried rice ever! Worth trying!"
,,Average Place for food,3.0,,We ended up at this place before going for a party to Tantric. There were only 2 stalls open at 11pm and they were very crowded. We ordered for our favourite Oyster omlette and fish balls. This was the first time I didnt like Seafood in Singapore. The taste was average and the fishballs smelled a lot. I left a big portion and it was difficult to explain it to the vendor. Choose the right stall and dish while at this food court.
,,Good food at a good price,5.0,,"This is where the locals eat, it is fast and a bit overwhelming but you get used to it. Loads of things to choose from, just pick a stall,queue up and go for it. I will say if there is a que there is a reason for it. It is not fine dining but it is delicious"
,,My Favorite Hawker Centre,5.0,,"We were in Singapore for 2 weeks, simply to enjoy Singaporean Cuisine from cheap eats Hawker stalls to good priced restaurants that locals love. Maxwell Food Centre was by far our favorite! This Hawker Centre has a number of good places to eat and they are Really good and also cheap!
Our favorite was Yi Jia Chao Zhou Yu Zhou Fish Soup either with rice or with Bee Hoon or noodle. Or the famous Chicken Rice Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice, or for a great Congee or Porridge Zhen Zhen Porridge, or try stall no. 12 for a good Hokkien Mee or Carrot Cake, but be prepared to line up, as these are very popular!!
For something sweet, I recommend having the Lim Kee Banana Fritters or Fried Bananas or go to Lao Ban Soya Beancurd and try the Soya Milk or the Soya Beancurd."
,,Really interesting and tastey,5.0,,"This place is always thriving and shows an insight into local culture! Tian Tian chicken rice is the best among many other chicken rice sellers however don‚Äôt go to late they sell out and close early, a good time is just before 5 and the ques have not started yet. A must do in Singapore!"
,,Maxwell Food Centre Singapore,4.0,,A good food centre with great varieties of food... Many office people goes there for lunch. It opens till very late.. I like to go there for a good bowl of congee in the late evening..A good place for tourist to try Singapore local food... The famous chicken rice stall is there...
,,Maxwell Food Centre,5.0,,"We go there every year, and it does not disappoint. My favourite eatery in Singapore- with a cold Tiger beer!"
,,Authentic and cheap,5.0,,"Had seen Bourdain eat here in the past, so felt the need to check it out on our recent trip to Singapore. Wandered around all the stalls before I settled on my 'Wonderful' new friend. Black pepper chicken noodles and wonton soup for 9 bucks.

Food was authentic and just as expected. Would come back in a heartbeat."
,,Good nonya food plus more,5.0,,"Went to try the tian tian chicken rice - queue was 25 to 30 meters long at 1pm - must be good but too hot to wait!

Easier to go inside have a large beer ($6) and choose something else thats not so popular like chicken curry and laksa from the nonoya store only $10 for the two dishes - both were great"
,,Great food!,5.0,,Great food place - one of my personal favorites in Singapore. Lots to choose from. Alle good and a very good price. A lot of the food stalls are closed on Sundays.
,,Come Hungry!,5.0,,After a 17 hour flight in from Los Angeles this was our first stop for a late lunch. So glad we were hungry because there is so much good food to try here. We waited in line for the Chicken Rice dish at Tien Tien and it was tasty. But the best dish I found was the fried oysters for $2 each. Yummy! Hawker Centers are a fun Singapore attraction and this one did not disappoint.
,,Reasonable delicious food in Singapore,5.0,,"When I visit Singapore, I always go to Maxwell food center.
I would like to try most famous Êµ∑ÂçóÈ∂èÈ£Ø but they always close when I got there..
My favorite is zhen zhen porridge.
It was best porridge I have ever tasted.
They open fron early morning but they close once they finish their stock so must go before 10 am."
,,Street Food paradise,5.0,,"If you want a cheap and filling fix, this is your stop. You find just about everything typically local, but make sure you have small cash, as they won't take credit/debit card and big bills either. They'll be grateful for a lot of little change. Also very accommodating when you want a dish a little modified (for the most part), just be polite and don't ask to pay less just because you want something taken out, that's a little rude. From savoury to sweet, you can taste a huge variety for all palates."
,,So many delicious food!,5.0,,"If you're on a budget but want to eat delicious food, this is the place to visit. You can find anything from sugarcane juice, porridge, noodles, rice, etc. There's so much to choose from. This is also the home of Tian Tian Chicken and rice, which is worth a try. We were addicted to the sugarcane juice. It was a little over 1 US dollar. It does get a little hot in there, no AC. Instead they had fans but you can barely feel it. So if you're eating hot soup, I suggest you also get yourself a cup of cold juice or water. Seating is first come first serve. There's plenty of it but if it gets too crowded, you may have to share."
,,"Best hawker centre, cheap, delicious",5.0,,"Maxwell Food Court is known for its delicious foods. We had our lunch here and we were amazed. The place was clean enough, for hawker centre standard. The foods were delicious and the price was very reasonable. One of our favorite was it sugar cane ice."
,,The Best Go To Place for Meal,5.0,,"Maxwell Food Ctr is my favorite among all hawker centres in SG, reason being: got the famous stalls (important for tourists like me bcs you don't want to spend your money & time for a not so good food), seating area is clean, located near Chinatown. Apart from the Tian Tian Chicken Rice (I prefer Tong Fong Fatt), go try the Maxwell Fuzhou Oyster Cake, Min Jiang Kueh, Lao Ban Beancurd, and Hainanese Chicken Rice. They all taste great and value for money. In rush hour don't forget to chope your seat with tissue pack or umbrella. I chope mine with water bottle and the cleaning auntie just throw it away :""D"
,,Spoilt for Choice,4.0,,"From a 1 plate meal to a 3-4 course meal , it's all available with a choice of different cuisines .
From breakfast food to a light snack in-between ,to lunch and then dinner , it's all there .
Best of all, it's cheap so ,go ahead , try something you've never had before - you don't have to finish it ,but you will ! It's all delicious!!"
,,satay was tough,3.0,,"heard of lau pa sat and how they closed a section of the road but i think after some renovations throughout the years it has lost it's character. satay was tough - should go to east coast lagoon next time and they were trying too hard for you to choose their food.. there's so many other food centres, sorry but we won't go here next time"
,,Good food and environment,4.0,,"Best place in Singapore for reasonably-priced food. There are lots of options around, ranging from pure Chinese to halal Muslim stalls. I waited in line for the Hainanese chicken, which was great."
,,Might be the best Hawker Centre in Singapore!,5.0,,"This might be my favourite hawker centre in Singapore - there are a lot of stalls, so you get quite a variety of things, we had some very good siu mai and won ton from a place on the last row, around the middle (they only do dumplings so you can't miss it) and then chicken rice from Tong Fong Fatt. You'll probably see a huge queue outside Tian Tian, I am sure it is amazing but I can vouch for Tong Fong being incredibly good too - and there was no insane queue!!"
,,Crowded during lunch time with delicious food,3.0,,We visited centre during lunch time with crowded people. Therfore we purchased food and take away to enjoy in hotel. The food is delicious: Hanan Chiken Rice and Rice Noodle. I recommended you take away the foods if the centre is too crowded and relax and enjoy in the hotel.
,,Good experience for the value,4.0,,"Good food for little money. You can share the table with everybody and it's good to meet people especially if you are traveling alone like I do, is awesome."
,,not much of vegetarian food,3.0,,"Just too much of meat. If you are vegetarian, you may have some difficulties to find anything without meat. Finally, we found some muslim food where the seller also offered us meatless alternative of her food. That was pretty good."
,,Central local market,4.0,,"The market is very close to China town, very popular among Singaporeans

There is have so many places to eat, but be careful, not all the ones are good.

I have lucky with a very tasteful and yummy Ramen for a little place and a nice gyozas from other place

Is a open space market with a share tables"
,,Cheap and tasty,4.0,,"Thanks to other reviewers, we knew the drill for our first visit to a hawker centre. Grab seat first, leave umbrella or body to hold place, make sure you have sanitiser and napkins/tissues and you are good to walk around the stalls deciding on what to eat. Some of the popular stalls have long queues. There is a great selection of food."
,,One of the best hawker,5.0,,Still my favorite eatery. Alot of nice food there. Just head there and go for food with queues. Definitely why there was a queue to begin with
,,LAD AND DAD....,4.0,,"We ate here on Friday.....ABSOLUTELY delicious English / Aussie type fish and chips.but guess the mushy peas made it more English Three good sized pieces of north sea haddock cooked to perfection and the chips were delicious ,( that from a person who doesn't really like chips)... Friendly smiling people who stayed cool under pressure of a busy lunch time...., Highly recommended and the stall next door serves a delicious refreshing Lychee drink........Thank you LAD AND DAD.....Looking forward to seeing you again on our next trip to beautiful Singapore.. ."
,,Authentic food and so cheap,5.0,,We loved this hawker market food. We visited 3 times and every time we were delighted with the fantastic fresh food and how cheap it was.
,,Tong Fong Fatt chicken and rice!,5.0,,This was the most amazing chicken rice we had on our visit. So tender so moist so tasty Memorable lunch at the Maxwell Food Center
,,"So Many Vendors, Food To Die For!",4.0,,"Advised by our hotel to come along here. We did not know what to expect, thinking it was going to be dirty and horrible but to our surprise, the place is clean. The tables are cleaned in a blink of an eye. There is so much food to choose from. We opted for chicken rice and boy oh boy, was it good! I have never tasted something so simple yet so delicious. The vendor has three different sizes and I went for the small as I did not know what to expect, but even this was quite large. Cost is minimum, so a group of 4 of us, we paid not more than $40 in total and that included a couple of drinks.
If I have the chance, I would have been here daily!"
,,good food for a cheap price,4.0,,We visited after we had hawker chan's chicken rice. We were looking for dessert after lunch and discovered that Maxwell Food Centre offers a variety of foods. We ended up getting a few dishes to share along with some drinks and dessert. You won't be disappointed.
,,Best Chicken Rice in Singapore?!,5.0,,"If you are looking for real good Chicken Rice - Hainanese Chicken- I recommend you try Tong Fong Fatt (Maxwell Hawker Centre #01-17). Greatest taste and the stall owner and his companion always offer good and fast service. I found this place when I came to Singapore 10+ years ago and I keep returning here with friends, guests and family for the for the ""real and original taste"". Former Prime Minister and President Lee Kuan Yew was here many years ago, so it has tradition. Well worth a visit, let me know what you think."
,,Lunch,4.0,,Local famous food centre that had been here for decades. As s result many of the food stalls had been here for years and these are experienced hawkers and cooks. As a rule you will not be disappointed with any fix you try. Prices are reasonable as they cater to the general public and not to tourists alone.
,,Maxwell food court review,5.0,,Really good place to eat cheap food.Generous quantity. Food priced between 1.5 SGD to 4 SGD. Very limited options for vegetarians. It's located near the lane opposite the Buddha Tooth relic temple. 10 minutes walk from Chinatown MRT station exit A. Toilets are nearby. Open from 11 am to 10 pm.
,,Cheap eats and great atmosphere,4.0,,"We visited Maxwell Food Centre with high expectations and were not disappointed :) We had the typical haiwainese chicken and rice, pork and rice and a stir-fried broccoli dish, hubby also had some gyoza which were incredible. We also had some (ok a lot of) Tiger beer and sugar cane juice to go with.

It was very easy to get here and we found a table straight away. Although it was early on the in the evening, there were a number of stalls open and we didn't have to wait long for food.

Really recommend Maxwell food centre. Very clean and of course very affordable. Great local food all around. We felt very spoilt for choice here.

Definitely a must visit when in Singapore."
,,My Favourite Hawkers Centre,5.0,,"This place is by far one of the better hawkers centre's we visited.
I think we may have tried everything and every time it was fabulous.
Even a coffee roasters for great coffee!
We were lucky enough to be staying right near this amazing food Centre.
Must try...
Nynoya's Chicken Rending
Handmade Tofu (delicious), Bao buns, dumplings and congee (can't remember name sorry but they sell frog legs too!) Pic below
Also so had some of the best Indian food extremely cheap! $2 for 2 roti & small bowl of Dahl so yummy.
Fried banana.... I could go on and on!
Make sure you go"
,,Cheap eats....,3.0,,"A good selection of different food and drink in a fairly basic setting. Tricky to get into at the moment because of all the MRT/ road works around. It's been like that since at least February 2017 because it was the same during our last visit!
Worth a visit to see what a slightly less glossy hawkers centre looks like."
,,Good place for variety,5.0,,Low price. Great variety. This is a great place to try a lot of lot of local foods. Worth visiting if you are in the area.
,,Great variety of food in one location,5.0,,"The food here is great! Affordable priced but visit the white clam beehoon, chicken rice, western food and spinach soup!"
,,My first time at a hawker center. Surprisingly good.,5.0,,"I've been to Singapore a few times, but I never went into one of the hawker food centers. Well, now that I've been, I'll be going more often ‚Äî I had chicken rice, tea eggs, and noodles, and it was fantastic food at an extremely reasonable price. In the past I'd avoided this type of spot since I wasn't sure about cleanliness, but a local friend explained how it's regulated and subsidized by the government, and upon closer inspection, it's indeed clean and high-quality (though not at all fancy in decor). In any event, marvelous good at a good price. Give it a try."
,,An amazing place,5.0,,"Many times we have been to Singapore, but hadn't made it to the Maxwell Food Centre. What a mistake - we should have eaten here every time. Thought we might eat early (11:50) for lunch - the place was already packed with queues at the most popular stalls. We finally found a couple of spare seats and headed off for whatever took our fancy. We decided on black pepper chicken and noodles which took no time to prepare (as expected), so a bit of added 'heat' and back to the table for lunch. All very tasty and good value. The Maxwell Centre by this stage had even more people lining up at most stalls so the timing was good for a table. A very popular place for cheap eats - recommended."
,,Really good hawker stall!,5.0,,"Really good hawker stall with plenty of fans which is a must in the Singapore heat. Good food selection, the famous Tian Tian chicken rice can be found here. Big, relatively clean. Easy walk from Chinatown."
,,Fantastic Experience.,5.0,,"cozy, nice place, easy to reach, many varieties of food, mostly clean, mix tourists and local costumes, what I tried was delicious and funny, as I ordered 3 plates, thinking small portions, and came 3 big plates... very reasonable prices."
,,Lot of choice with halal food,4.0,,it close to my office and they have few option for HALAL food and the food taste also decent . you will find standard out let in singapore or other singapore hawker.
,,Chinese food,5.0,,I find best hainan chicken rice and other chinese food here. You can get food and drink on cheap price.
,,This is the place to try Hawker Street food,4.0,,"Make sure you look around at all the food stands before you settle down and eat. This place has lots to offer. Once you find the place you want to eat, find a table to sit at. order and then get your Tiger beer. The meals are very cheap and lots of locals eat here, which is a good thing.

Well worth the visit."
,,Nice chicken rice but this hawker centre lacks variety,3.0,,"Maxwell Food Centre is renowned for the Chicken Rice- cheap and very yummy! Try Tian Tian or Ah Tai. But for me, the centre it lacked variety. It may be because I went with my family for an early dinner (Approx 6pm). A lot of the stalls were closed or closing! Something interesting I discovered was a stall with hand made red-bean filled donuts (Hum Jin Pang). They are 6 for $1- a bargain!! And freshly fried and dusted with icing sugar- it is a perfect way to end your visit here!"
,,Singapore Local Food To Go,4.0,,"There are many famous and delicious food stalls at this food centre. It is specially well known for its Tian Tian Chicken Rice. But that's just one of many excellent meals! The queue was extremely long during my visit, however, I had order some other delicious food especially the Zhen Zhen Fish Porridge.
If you liked your porridge thick and dense, cooked with broken grains instead of whole rice, you would feel this pleasurable. Every spoonful of porridge I eaten was full of ingredients, such as chicken meat (or fish slices) and century egg, and other peripherals of spring onion, shallots and chopped preserved vegetables. That made the porridge un-plain and exciting to eat. It was easily one of the better congees around with its smooth texture and varied constituents. I don't always like porridge especially those cooked with the whole rice, I will never want to try it as I don't like it. However, I will definitely suggest you to try for this Zhen Zhen Porridge."
,,The place for Hainanese chicken rice!,5.0,,"Maxwell Food Centre is very central when you're visiting Chinatown. It is especially renown, and justifiably so, for Tian Tian Chicken Rice. But that's just one of many excellent meals! I had the best roti pratha ever at Maxwell! Go the egg roti pratha; it's a big snack or small meal accompanied by a plate of 'curry gravy'. Tear off bits of your roti and sop up the delicious curry gravy. Even if you've merely walked your legs off and want to sit a moment over a teh tarik or kopi susu, this is the place!

Suggestion: If you exit Maxwell on the southern end and cross the street and walk one block, 3 or 4 minute walk, you'll come across an historic red brick building in an odd triangular shape. There's a sort of arcade along the far side and if you look up, you'll see the words JINRIKIKSHA STATION carved above about the 3rd arch. Take a photo! This is the historic rickshaw (jinrikisha in Japanese) station where rickshaw operators would queue up and wait for customers.
I've had meals and snacks at Maxwell, both with friends and alone. Don't be shy if you're on your own! Just lunge in and check out what's on the various menus!"
,,If you only go to oneHawker Centre go here,5.0,,"This is a ""must eat"" place. If you go for dinner though, get there before 8 if you want the full range of stalls to choose from. Hainese Chicken appears to be the go-to dish for the place and there is always a line at Tian Tian. If you can't be bothered waiting (like me) then I strongly recommend trying the versions at either Shop 42 or Shop 7. The proprietor of Shop 7 used to work at Tian Tian and learnt his skills there. The broth at Shop 42 is slightly ""heavier"" than the other but has a depth of flavour that is particularly pleasing. Hard to choose between the two of them, so I suggest you try both!
If you are looking for something to drink, the Juice Farm at Shop 50 makes the best banana or mango smoothies around."
,,Disappointing following time in Vietnam & Thailand,3.0,,"Various stalls all seeming to sell the same items. We ordered a wonton soup ($5) and wonton noodle with pork dish ($3.50) from one stall and found it pricey compared to street food we were having in Vietnam and Thailand (although I understand Singapore is MUCH more expensive in general than other Southeast Asian countries). The flavour was just average. I‚Äôm glad we stopped in as hawker centres are apparently a staple in Singapore; however, I found the little amount of selection disappointing and the quality sub-par."
,,You Have to See This Place!,4.0,,Of course the famous Maxwell Food Centre in Chinatown must be on your itinerary. Wide range of choices. Tough to get a seat though. I tried Tien Tien Hainanese chicken and rice and a dumpling place I don't recall the name of. Was there late in the day. Lots of interesting local foods.
,,Good local food,4.0,,"We made our way one night over to the Maxwell Food Centre near our hotel in Chinatown. We walked through a bunch of construction sites, and finally saw a sign with an arrow. It was about 830pm and I'd say about half the hawkers were closed, but the ones that were open really wanted our business. We finally ordered food at stall #37: Wanton Noodle soup and Black pepper chicken noodle soup. They told us to sit down and brought us a coke and a beer to go with the meal and sure enough our meal was served piping hot a few minutes later (see my pics). Very
good meal for under US$10 for the both of us. And we both enjoyed it!"
,,Don‚Äôt tell me you come Singapore without visiting Maxwell,5.0,,"I‚Äôve come to Singapore for various reasons many times, but this‚Äôs the first time I tried here. Surprisingly it‚Äôs not too hot and the fan ventilation‚Äôs very good. Food is inexpensive but super yummy. Don‚Äôt miss the Tian Tian, don‚Äôt be scared away by the long queue, ‚Äòcause eventually you will find every minute of waiting is worthy. The chicken is so juicy and tender and the rice has beautiful aroma! The shop ËààËàà right opposite to it selling super tasty tapioca cake is sold out before 1:30pm. If you are a foodie like me, love authentic local cuisines and mixing with local people, Maxwell is definitely your cup of tea!"
,,Great for cheap eats,4.0,,"Maxwell's has always been a favourite when we are in Singapore and we had another extraordinary cheap meal here recently. Chicken rice is king here but there are so many other meals available, our problem is there is too much choice. We love this place."
,,Very hard for vegetarian,4.0,,There are almost zero options for vegetarian at Maxwell food Centre. But the good news is the non vegetarian options are quite good and a taste of local cuisine. The environment is good and the beer stalls had some good quality beer for 9.99.
,,There for the chicken rice,4.0,,Wonderful chicken rice. Great hawker center. Lots of variety & food. Try the chicken rice there. Chicken is tender & soft.
,,Local food at local prices,4.0,,One of the delights of Singapore is to eat at one of the local food halls. Maxwell is one of these. What it lacks in decorum it makes up in atmosphere and shear value. It is a hidden gem for a genuine Singapore dining experience.
,,Great meal with locals,5.0,,"If you want to eat surrounded by locals in Chinatown this is the place. Good food for a crazy honest price. As the food choice ranges from Indian, Singaporean to Chinese and so on, its a great place to taste traditional flavours. What I liked the most is that, compared to the famous food streets in Chinatown, I looked around my table and I was one of the very few foreigners.

This food centre makes you experience the true soul of Chinatown."
,,Great visit,5.0,,This was recommended by a local to be able to try real local food. It was a fun experience and really enjoyed the food. very easy to get to and good prices also. Recommended this place to anyone visiting Singapore
,,All the great Asian foods in one place. Insane.,5.0,,"My Tian tian hainanese chicken rice review is elsewhere - deserves its own.

The other things we had from various stalls were amazing also!!!! Honey bbq char siu pork - brilliant. The best fried dumplings I‚Äôve ever had.

Fresh ripe fruit makes for refreshing rehydration stations!!

With selections of Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Thai, Malaysian food amongst others, this is the place to be."
,,Excellent food patronised by locals!,5.0,,You need to go see for yourself and decide what you want to try. Too many stalls can be highly recommended! Beware it will be hot and noisy but that is what food centres in Singapore can be like...what great atmosphere!
,,Lots choices,4.0,,"Known mostly for chicken rice and oyster cakes,I decided to get some chicken briyani ,good but should stuck to chicken rice"
,,Lots of Choices. Lots of Color. Price is Right,5.0,,"Big, crowded, friendly, loud. I didn't see any hamburgers but I think everything else must have been there. Meals we had were excellent and easy on the budget. Regular lunch spot for workers in the area. Fast in, fast out but sit a watch if you want to.

We loved it."
,,Abundance of great food,5.0,,"There are over 100 food stalls of all cuisine and you really can eat like royalty, be sure to get there early if you want to beat the queue for the best chicken rice. Washed down with some refreshing beverages"
,,Authentic experience and great food,4.0,,"Came here as a first stop on a street food tour in the peak of lunch rush hour. Being surrounded by locals and fighting to get a seat might have been intimidating without the guide, but felt all the more authentic for it. We had some amazing Hainanese chicken and rice, but there were loads of stalls to choose from and most looked tasty too."
,,Familiar,5.0,,Many of the stalls has a long history behind them. Most are here for the chicken rice but there are a lot more other options to explore.
,,Chicken Rice,4.0,,"First thing came to mind when arriving was definitely for the Â§©Â§© chicken rice. Portion and price are both affordable amd acceptable. Chicken was juicy. Other than that, there's a lot of other food stall as well. Location was perfect for those who work mearbh and want to get a good and cheap food."
,,Good food--not too expensive,4.0,,"Excellent hawker center. So many good options to choose from. The chicken over rice is delicious and very popular. We also had some fried noodles, buns with pork and very delicious lime juice. You have to stop here for affordable Singapore food. At lunch it gets pretty busy so tables can be hard to come by. Definitely a must stop."
,,everyone must visit this place!,5.0,,This place is amazing. Where else can you get hainanese chicken and rice for $5? Popiah for $2.80 and satay chicken for $4!! Go with an empty stomach and order lots of different things to try!
,,Awesome selection,5.0,,"Great range of fantastic hawker food options. Authentic Singaporean as well as a range of fusion food stalls. Tasty, large portions and cheap. Yummy"
,,A must if you‚Äôre visiting Singapore,5.0,,"You absolutely must visit here if you‚Äôre staying in Singapore! The food and atmosphere is amazing, so much choice and such a diverse clientele. A highlight of our Singapore trip was trying all the different foods available here."
,,Great Food,5.0,,Great food great prices. Try the oyster cake it is really awesome. Really good local type food court.
,,Asian foodie paradise. Great for those on a budget.,5.0,,"Had chicken with rice one night. Large portion included rice, bok choy, meat and soup. Total cost was less than SGD$5.00. Ate a famous fried oyster cake from a stall visited by Anthony Bourdain. Another night had Abriyoni from a halal stall, which was delicious. Great place for low cost eats!
Be ready to share empty space with strangers at your table.
Beware: some of these foods are very spicy. Be sure to check with the stall owner if you have an aversion to hot foods."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Absolutely delicious food, dirt cheap. Average cost $3.50- $5 per plate. I am guilty of always picking the hawker with the longest queue. Truth is, all of this food is high quality and delicious. I made the mistake of going to Smith Street one night and regretted it. Average prices lifted to about $10-12 per plate and no where near as tasty. Came back to Maxwell every night for a week to try something different. Full of locals. Very friendly service. Energetic, buzzy atmosphere. Give the restaurants a miss and head here! Highly recommended."
,,"Tasty, typical Singapore hawker centre with a variety of different foods from the different ethnic groups in Singapore",4.0,,"Generally a good place to get a quick and fairly cheap bite in the heart of town.

Many visitors from overseas visit the hawker centre to eat at Tian Tian chicken rice as it has become world famous thanks to the likes of Anthony Boudain, However if that is all you eat there it would be a supreme waste. There are many stalls there that serve good food in a range of cuisine.

1) Dim Sum
2) Popiah (freshly wrapped spring rolls)
3) Rojak (a local style salad with fremented shrimp paste dressing)
4) Porridge
5) Banana fritters (a after meal dessert also eaten as a snack during tea or just because one is peckish)
6) Fried/Boiled Dumplings

The list is endless, however I do recommend that you visit at 11.30 am if you intend to have lunch. The office crowd come in two waves. 12 pm - 1 pm, and 1 pm - 2 pm. If you decide to drop by after that, many of the stalls would have closed up for the day.

A word of advice though, there are many juice stalls there and the prices do vary a little. The stall named juice farm has a rather unagreeable owner who if he decided he doesn't like you for whatever reason, will be rude and unpleasant to the extent that he will harass you at your seat, as long as you seat within view of his stall."
,,Nice Hawkers Market,4.0,,"Tidy, pleasant food hall with a huge variety of choice, some famous stalls and some very friendly and happy stall vendors.

We enjoyed an hour or so, sampled drinks, food and felt safe, touts didn't come and bother us at all, so all in all it was a lovely place."
,,Budget dining but delicious with a great variety,5.0,,"After a walk through Chinatown, locals recommended Maxwell Food centre for a bit to eat. We had Rohan, Popiah, the famous Chicken rice and tofu sweet pudding. All very delicious and fresh. Due to Chinese New Year, a number of stalls were not open, however, we managed to have a good meal."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"We were staying in a hotel nearby and came across this place 1 evening. It was absolutely packed and so much choice and very cheap freshly cooked food, we even got to sit and chat to the locals which was great. You really need to try it."
,,Yummy and cheap!,5.0,,"Singapore is a pricey city by SEA standards, so places like Maxwell are a boon for the budget traveller. Dozens of food stalls to choose from, including the well-known chicken rice. Plenty of tables as well as washrooms. FYI, it's not air-conditioned as it's semi open air. Just a few minutes walk from Chinatown."
,,Another quality food centre,4.0,,"Visually this place is very similar to many other food centres, and sells a similar range of food. However, it was a little easier to find a seat than many other places we have been to, and was in the right place at the right time for our dining needs, so gets my vote as being very good.

A little tricky to gain access to at the moment due to significant road=altering construction in the vicinity."
,,Cheap eats and beer,5.0,,"2 lunches and 2 beers were $15. If you can get over the fact that it is noisy, messy and a little hot then eating in these hawkers markets is simply the way to go. Singapore have a high standard of hygiene so food is safe unlike a lot of nearby countries. I NEVER eat anywhere else and i can holiday here more often with the $$$$ i save."
,,Food Lovers Paradise,5.0,,You wanna taste food .. and this is the place to be ... Varieties and varities of cuisines .. we tried starters from multiple cuisines ... Not exactly where we were staying but we kinda enjoyed being here .. A must visit for every food lover
,,Stall #93 - Spinach & Soup | order the stir fry seafood noodle,4.0,,"Writing to encourage both locals and foreigners to visit this food centre. Here, you will be able to experience 1st hand, how local and international tastes present themselves to budding gourmet in a local food centre. Expect typical Singaporean fare, the likes of chicken rice, fishball noodles, etc, along with speciality ramen, western cuisines and english stews."
,,Wow!,4.0,,"This is what street food in Singapore is all about. It's loud, crowded, hot etc but the food is fantastic.

It works like this:

1 Work your way around all the stalls and decide what you want to eat.
2 Place your order and find a table. Be prepared to share a table.
3 Grab your meal from your chosen stall when it is ready.
4 Optionally grab a drink from one of the drink stalls.
5 Get back to your table.
6 Enjoy.

I had a Mee Hoon Goreng Ikan Bilis from the ""Barrakkath Excellent Briyani Muslim Food"" stall. This basically translates as fried noodles with vegetables and dried anchovies. It was really good. I washed it down with an icy cold tiger which was also really good.

Not silver service and there are no extensive wine lists but the whole thing (mee goreng plus beer) cost about S$10. Good honest food at very reasonable prices.

The guys at the stall told me they do a world beating Biryani. I'm going back to test their claims next time I'm in Singapore"
,,Great food for the price,5.0,,"One of the great ideas Singapore had so many years ago was to move all the hawkers to general locations and keep them off the streets. Maxwell is awesome for food and prices. If a family needs to save some money at meal time, then all the food hawker locations are a must."
,,We always eat there while in Chinatown,4.0,,"This time we tried hainanese and roasted chicken meals from ""Heng Heng Hainanese chicken rice"" stall and it came with rice, vegetables and soup: very tasty. Women restrooms were very dirty!!!"
,,Every tourist should eat in a hawker center at least once,5.0,,If you like traditional asian food for unbeatable prices you should go to a hawker center. Rest assured that despite the rather messy look (the total opposite of the very clean city) the food is delicious.
,,Asia Food,5.0,,If you are looking for different variety of Asia food THis is a good place But avoid lunch crowd .Going at 11am should be ok
,,"Hawker Centre that is not too big, not too small, but just right.",4.0,,"I found myself going back to Maxwell a number of times mainly because of its excellent Hainanese chicken stalls (yes, the famous one and also the one beside it was pretty good too). The size and location of the hawker centre was just right for me as it wasn't too massive, and it was easily accessible from tourist areas. I tried the other food stalls in the hawker centre over several days and all were quite good. You may not get the same variety of food as La Pau Sat, but what they have is very good."
,,Food on the hoof!,4.0,,"Was recommended this food court as it was close by. Well worth the visit as great variety of different cuisines but predominantly Asian of course. Was told to go to Tian Tian but that was closed so joined the queue for another Hiananese Chicken which looked popular, Hong Xiang Chicken Rice. Actually took an hour to get served. It was certainly excellent both that plus the Soya Sauce Chicken Rice, Bok Choi in Oyster Sauce and bean sprouts as extra sides. Total $20sg. Went back next day later to have a fresh juice and saw queue at Hong Xiang was still about 45 minutes although 15:00 long past the busy lunch period.

Thus well recommended to come to try top quality Hawker Food."
,,A Food Experience!,4.0,,"If you enjoy sampling all manner of Asian food then get to Maxwell Food Centre. The accommodations are basic with a picnic environment. Inside and outside the main building are a myriad of food stalls! We went at night and the place was crowded but lots of fun. Prices are higher that you might expect, but not bad for Singapore. The food is very good and you can experiment with many different dishes available. Festive atmosphere."
,,Lots of delicious hawker fare available here,4.0,,"This is a well patronised food centre with office crowds on weekdays and leisure visitors and tourists on weekends. Among the stalls I patronise those selling are Hainanese Curry Rice, fish soup (at least 2 stalls), steamed tapioca cake, goreng pisang and peanut soup. Be prepared for long queues if you visit during peak hours."
,,"Authentic, but crowded",4.0,,"I do not claim to be an expert on the numerous hawker stalls and markets in Singapore, but I believe I can compare those that I have been to in the past 12 months. So, in my mind Maxwell sits below Tiong Bahru, but well above Tekka in Little India.

I walked through, I looked around and the one thing that struck me was the long queues for the obviously popular stalls. One in particular, had a queue stretching around the corner. I was really keen to try the food but I was equally not prepared to wait, so I missed out. Probably my loss.

Maxwell is famous. Maxwell is popular, so I guess most of the food on offer must be good. Reputations must be maintained and standards are always upheld.

I plan to return again one day."
,,Wonderful food - so cheap!,5.0,,"Enjoyed three meals here. Particularly enjoyed the Indian food, deep fried banana stall and fresh drink stalls too. It is so cheap! Also enjoyed sitting with other local diners exchanging conversation. Easy to find on edge of Chinatown."
,,good try for local food,4.0,,"there are locals, also many tourists. but it is still good place to good if you would like to find some local food. try some with queues of locals."
,,Great food at local prices,5.0,,We had to try Hainanese Chicken Rice and the queue at Tian Tian was out of control. So we ordered a chicken rice and a BBQ chicken rice from Heng Heng. It was sensational and cheap as chips. Bought a cold Tiger tallie from another vendor and had a meal fit for a king and got change out of $20. Would go again in a heartbeat.
,,Jiay dont like the environment,3.0,,"Not offense, but I personally not really a fan of this kind of dinning place. It's hot, noisy, and not so clean. The price of the foods are, of course, at very reasonable level. But considering the quality and overall atmosphere, I will only recommend to visit once to taste the really Singapore street foods."
,,Ho Kee Porridge,4.0,,Look for Ho Kee Porridge it‚Äôs one of He best you will find in Singapore my favorite is the fish porridge. I love this stuff simple but really really good food.
,,Lots of choice,4.0,,"Plenty of choice, huge number of stalls and was easy for a solo traveller to find cheap and tasty local food and drink. No frills but clean and tidy when I visited on a Friday afternoon."
,,Very good and cheap local food restaurant,4.0,,When beeing in Chinatown and want to eat very good local food the bast place is Maxwell food centre. The place was clean not very noisy and the food is fantastic. Of course it depence of the order and the personal taste. worth to try.
,,Good value and choices,4.0,,One of my favourite hawker centre in Singapore. Good value and plenty of choices of Singaporean food. Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice is one of the top attraction but we also love the soy milk and dessert from Lao Ban Soya Beancurd (ËÄÅ‰º¥Ë±ÜËä±)! The dessert (Ë±ÜËä±) is soft and silky but not too sweet! Super yummy!
,,Must do for local food experience!,5.0,,"Take the MRT to China Town then it's a 5 minute walk via the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple.
This is a no frills authentic dining experience. Soooo much to choose from at $3 and $4 dollars per plate.
It's very much like a hawker/street food set up of small stalls which specialise in one or two dishes. We had chicken, pork, duck, and rice dishes which were sensational. You can also by beer and the sugar cane juice is also a specialty. We also bought some sweets - peanuts and yellow beans in a rice flour pastry to take away with us.
Very much a hustle and bustle kind of place. It's all under cover with seats and tables in the middle. I understand they open for breakfast as well and some great specials are to be had then too.
Haven't eaten so much in along time - so cheap and so very good! Don't miss it!"
,,Great Food for Little Money,5.0,,"The Maxwell Hawkers Food establishment is amazing. The food options are unbelievable and the prices are very low. It is rated Michelins No 1 Hawkers Market in Singapore.
Visit the Singapore National Gallery firs and then have lunch the market which is across the road. Try An Tien Hienanesse Chicken. The owner of this stand once worked for Tien Tien which is renowned as the best in Singapore. However, the cook who was working there at the time has now opened his own stall called An Tien Hianianesse Chicken. You will find a long queue at Tian Tian but they are queuing at the wrong place !!!

This Hawkers Market is the kind of place one can go back to again and again and still never try everything. The establishment is spotlessly clean and no need to worry about getting ""delhi belly"" We were taken there by a Singaporian and tried so many dishes, every one different and delicious. ."
,,Many choices besides Tin Tin chicken rice,4.0,,"Finally tried Tin Tin chicken really good, suggest order half chicken. Lots of other choices too won't be disappointed though some of them close early better go for lunch."
,,No need to comment further.,4.0,,If you are heading for Singapore and trying to taste real local taste. Go to Maxwell Food Center or other hawker center near Newton Station. A variety of food and very reasonable price.
,,Love the queues,5.0,,"Maxwell food centre is a place I visit at least once a year; been here 11 years. When you go to Maxwell, head to the stall with the longest queue, you won't be sorry. Lots of places to choose from that don't have a long queue, so if don't have the patience, it's still ok. For me, Maxwell is a major landmark, not any less important than the Merlion. Check it out."
,,A food center with everything including gourmet coffee and Craft BEER.,5.0,,"This is a must go place for everyone residing in Sg and all tourists. Just try to avoid weekdays during 12-2pm if you hate crowds like me. This food center has everything, from local delights like deep fried dumplings at $0.30, porridge, Chicken rice, gourmet espresso and even Craft beer.

I would highly recommend the Tian tian chicken rice and the Hainanese curry rice."
,,Grotty and Crowded,2.0,,"Not really that nice a place to eat. The food is not that fabulous, we tried the apparently amazing Hainan chicken rice at one of the stalls, it was alright and fairly cheap but nothing to write home about. The place was dirty and noisy, the trays were reused without being washed and there were nowhere near enough tables at lunchtime. The Food Republic food courts you could find in some of the shopping centres were air-conditioned, clean, with plenty of seating and great food, and only a little more expensive, go there instead."
,,Good choices and value - but some long wait times,4.0,,"Good choices and value - but some long wait times, it was good to visit and experience some of the ones in the centres on Orchard and at Vivo City off good food to."
,,Reasonable,4.0,,Good place to have some good local food at reasonable price ( well the city is expensive ) . You can get lots of varieties of food . Located close to china Town Mrt
,,Many different food areas,5.0,,"It was great to see all the different food options in one place. One day we tried Japanese,and Indian"
,,Very reasonably priced lovely food,4.0,,"Was there and tried rosted duck/pork with rice at stall 71.superb food served by a very friendly host, there is always a que."
,,Fun guys and amazing food,5.0,,"Went today for lunch to stall 71 had the duck, char Sui and the lovely chef even threw in some Crispy belly pork. Seriously good food all for SD$4.50!!! (I had eaten half and thought on to take a photo)

The line was the busiest with locals I think we made the right choice as we sat with a local
And she goes to stall 71 a lot, it‚Äôs award winning too."
,,various local food with cheap price,5.0,,"When I travel, I enjoy eating various local food. So, this was the perfect place for us. Some of the them are open until late."
,,You haven‚Äôt done Singapore till you‚Äôve tried a Hawkers,4.0,,"A great way to sample all of the local cuisines in one place. From Malay to Indian, fish head soup to Nasi gorang to fruit and carrot cake it‚Äôs all under one roof here at Maxwell. We kept coming back just to try something new each day and didn‚Äôt have a bad meal. Located just near china town it‚Äôs easily accessible."
,,Favourite Hawker centre,5.0,,"We ate in Hawker centres or food courts every dinner while in Singapore and I think this was our favourite. We went there 2 nights in a row. It can be a little tricky to find especially as there is construction going on but just ask a local like we did.
Of course Tian Tian chicken rice is there and lives up to its reputation as Singapore‚Äôs best Chicken rice. But there were also lots of other wonderful dishes and stalls to order from. The Carrot cake from the stall across from Tian Tian was great, and stall 51 (or maybe 41 it was a few days ago) selling roast pork and duck was amazing and had longer queues than Tian Tian both times we were there and that is always the best indication of a good stall."
,,Nice place,4.0,,Have a good variety. Place is noisy as there were some constructions going on close by. Worth a try.
,,Great meals,4.0,,We only tried a few of the stalls as a lot of them were closed. Excellent food and good prices. Their beer is very reasonable at $6.00 for a large Tiger. I thought the craft beer was expensive.
,,Must try the Hainanese Chicken Rice from Tian Tian,5.0,,"Plentiful quality cheap eats, at a fraction of the price you would pay in a restaurant. Tian Tian serves excellent chicken rice and is hugely popular (long queues from 11.30 to around 3pm). Best to avoid visiting at lunch time if you can, though, when workers in adjoining offices fill the place. The stall selling fish head soup is also popular. ATMs and toilet facilities are available."
,,Hawker in Chinatown Area,4.0,,"Located in Chinatown area, opposite of the Buddha's Tooth Relic building. They have Tian Tian Chicken Rice, which has Michelin star. But their queue was quite long.
Price was average (cheaper than Newton Food Centre, but more expensive than Albert Centre - Bugis).
They seems to be renovating (December 2017), so we have to take small walkway to enter they place."
,,Not easy for us Brits but yes you can get a breakfast here,4.0,,We had intended to eat here one evening but ran out of time. Ended up visiting one breakfast time to take in the atmosphere. We found an excellent bread / cake hawker at one end and a good cup of western coffee somewhere in the middle.
,,Great cheap eats,5.0,,"Really worth a visit! We stayed in Chinatown so it was only a short walk to the Centre. So much choice! Malay, Thai, Chinese, Indian and just about any Asian food type you can think of. We ate here four times trying some thing different each time. The oyster pancake stall is well worth getting here early for."
,,Worth visithing,4.0,,"This is very interesting to have a look around. Lots of food stalls, energy, people watching. Just pick what you want to eat, find a seat, and sit to people watch. Even if you don't want to eat - it is worth a look around. The foods smell good too. For sure make a visit here."
,,"Great variety of local food, worth a break during lunch time",5.0,,"Excellent place to have lunch and enjoy local food. Prices are very affordable and drinks have similar prices in all stands. Good food and great atmosphere, what else can you ask for?"
,,Singapore Holday,5.0,,This has to be the best Hawker Food place in Singapore - so many food places to choose from but I was disappointed to note that Tian Tian Chicken rice was closed - not sure if this was because of the Holidays.....
,,This is Singapore!,5.0,,"My third time in spectacular Singapore and apart from the stunning city, food is an integral part of this society.
We have the deepest respect for the development of an international and sofisticated food culture here, but the culinary reason for us being here is the local and traditional food culture. And the hawker centres are the engines hat run these traditions.
Maxwell Food Centre is one of these, and it‚Äôs hard not to enjoy its culinary rainbow.
A very clean environment where the stalls get cerificates for cleanlines. A is the best, and I saw no C‚Äôs.
This is a caleidoscope of East Asian food. It‚Äôs there for the public to enjoy, quality at reasonable prices.
This is the jewel of Singapore!"
,,The price is affordable.,5.0,,"The chicken rice sold by 'Tian Tian' is very delicious. Not many people in the tea time session. But now there is a construction site next to it, we had to take a longer walk."
,,Not so impressed with the food,3.0,,"Despite all the reviews for Maxwell food center , I didn't think the food was as good as people say it was. I was very impressed with Chinatown Singapore though, it is very orderly and clean compared to other chinatowns in other countries. Maxwell food center is located in this area , it is a semi open air food center with seating areas in the middle part of the food center. The place was, as expected , crowded and like any other local food market set ups , is very hot and humid. There are a lot of food stalls , mostly serving local favorites like noodles, hot rice dishes, and of course the famous hainanese chicken rice and laksa. The dishes are all very reasonably cheap. There are also stalls that specialize in drinks and shakes and sell coconut juice as well. There is even a coffee stall. It is hard to get a table , so one has to wait for a table before purchasing meals."
,,Not so impressed with the food,3.0,,"Despite all the reviews for maxwell food center, I didn't think the food was as good as people say it was. I was very impressed with Singapore Chinatown area though , it is very orderly and clean compared to other chinatowns in other countries. Maxwell food center is located in this area, it is an open air food center (covered) and seating area in the middle sections . The place was , as expected, crowded and like any other local food market set up , is very hot and humid . There are a lot of food stalls , mostly serving local favorites, like noodles, hot rice dishes and of course the famous hainanese chicken rice . The prices are of course very reasonably cheap.

,,Great variety of local food,3.0,,I can only recommend this place is you travel with an adjusted budget. All customers are locals. FOod look and smell well and prices are more than afordable. Very close to CHinantown
,,Cheap and good local food,4.0,,"I looooove Singapore hawker food so whenever I visit, i usually make a pitstop at Maxwell. its got a great selection of stalls and is close to Chinatown MRT.

It gets super hot and crowded during lunchtimes, so be prepared to queue and sweat a little if you're not used to the heat. I'd brave the heat anyday to get my fill of hawker food! My favourites are the Sliced Fish porridge, chicken rice and the popiah - all pretty cheap and tasty!

You can't go wrong at Maxwell FC. Decisions, decisions - thats the only problem that you're probably going to have. Oh and, how much can you eat in one sitting!"
,,My favourite Hawker centre,5.0,,This is my favourite hawker centre in Singapore. The best place for fish bee hoon soup. One of the best Hainanese chicken rice stalls. Good local coffee and one of the best places for local sweets. All very well priced. Good food at low prices. It also has a craft beer stall though I find overpriced for the location.
,,Awesome Chicken rice..,4.0,,"One of my Singapore friend introduce me to go maxwell food centre to try Tian Tian chicken rice. We reached at 12noon, so plenty of people already there queuing.. The maxwell food centre quite near to Chinatown mrt station, we only walk about 10 minutes."
,,Great Cheap Backpacker Food!,4.0,,"This is one of the spots for cheap eats in Singapore and it‚Äôs great! You‚Äôre looking at around ¬£4.00 for a decent meal portion and it‚Äôs really tasty! There are all sorts of dishes, almost too much to choose from! Definitely worth a visit to this place!"
,,"Good, yummy, cheap food",4.0,,Loads to choose from at great prices. Kids love the choices of juices. Plenty of seating. Much cleaner than I'd expected. A welcome change from the exorbitant prices of food in Singapore.
,,Busy bustling place,4.0,,"This food court is crazy busy at lunch, no need to join the enormous que for chicken rice, it‚Äôs available at other vendors and let‚Äôs face it poached chicken and rice what could go wrong, really. Basic flavours without any enhancement so if it is well cooked that‚Äôs all you need. Seats can be difficult to find but to be part of the chaos is half the fun, obviously popular with locals it calmed down a lot but 1:30 so if crowds aren‚Äôt your thing maybe avoid the lunch time crush"
,,Best chicken rice ever,5.0,,"We stopped at this hawker centre whilst on a walking tour. I was rapt as it was on my to do list to try the chicken rice at Tian Tian. We got there at 11.00am and as it was early there was no queue.
I got a small plate of the chicken rice for 3.50SDG and honestly don‚Äôt worry about the chicken itself (which was nice even though its cold) the rice was beautiful. I would have been happy with just a plate of rice. Also tried a small white carrot cake stall 01-53. I am glad I ordered a small plate as it was huge. I liked it, tasted like an omelette with potato. My husband didn‚Äôt like it so the next time we went he tried the dark carrot cake which he thought was much nicer. My husband and son had fried chicken nasi lemak which they said was nice. We had 20 minutes at this place till the tour moved on. We passed it around 11.50 and there were huge queues forming so it was really good that we got there early.
We decided to come back that night for dinner. We were told it was best to go early before the major meal times as the queues can get long so we decided to go around 5.00pm. This was too early as more than half the stalls were closed. The whole family ordered the chicken rice from Tian Tian and we also got a fried kway teow from stall 01-53 for 4.00SDG which was ordinary, a small duck rice 4.00SDG from Hong Xiang Hainanese chicken which was nice and a Xing Zhou Mi Fen for 4.00SDGfrom a stall called spinach and soup which was OK.
The standout was definitely the chicken rice from Tian Tian. I recommend you try it."
,,Varieties of food,4.0,,"Reached there for a quick dinner. It's like a fast food but it's not a fast food like McD of Texas or KFC, but the food is served within minutes."
,,"Fun, Tasty, Cheap!",5.0,,"We loved going to Maxwell Food Centre! Not super convenient to the MRT, but worth the walk. Great choice in vendors. Lunch for two with a large Tiger beer was less than 15 SGD. It was busy, but not overwhelmingly crowded -- we had no problem finding seats."
,,Great place to grab a bite,4.0,,"Lots of variety and a wonderful place to people watch. Your not fine dining, in fact your probably sweating a bit, but a nice authentic small meal and a cold Tiger beer is a wonderful trade off for the lack of a/c."
,,"Good food, wide variety",4.0,,"Interting just to wander around all the food stalls. There is a wide variety of cheap and tasty food and also a few fruit-juice-bars. Only downside: The fans are really loud, it's better to pick a place at the edge"
,,Great,5.0,,I love the food there. There are so many kind of foods and drinks from different countries. I will definitely come back if I visit Singapore again.
,,Buy a sugar cane drink!,4.0,,"Lots of choice, cheap and cheerful. We found this to be a fun lunch spot with lots of different options from different countries. The sugar cane drinks tasted really nice and no one got a sore tummy afterwards!"
,,Eat with the locals,5.0,,"You want hustle and bustle and a great inexpensive meal, then the Maxwell food court is for you. Lots of choices and the famous chicken rice. Great atmosphere and great food. A must in Singapore."
,,If you are in for a meal,4.0,,If hawker food is your thing you have plenty of choice here. Reasonably clean and cheap. Must be good judging by the many visitors. Personally I was not impressed but perhaps just chose the wrong one.
,,Always a good place to eat in Singapore,4.0,,"All the choice that you need in an authentic food court, join in with the locals and experience food from around the region at reasonable prices."
,,nice place,5.0,,we unfortunately went there before most of the shops had fully opened up for the day but what we did see was enjoyable. Retailers can be a bit rude and don't take NO for an answer.
,,good value,3.0,,Its amazing that all the little outlets do such a wide variety of foods and such good value. You sit and watch it being cooked and all the interesting people..
,,Wide variety of food at great prices. Very clean and friendly,5.0,,"It is amazing how a city that is so expensive can have such inexpensive tasty food. Everything you want is under one roof at Maxwell. Each stall has a letter grade from the health department, most seem to be rated ‚ÄúB‚Äù. You can tell which ones are the most popular given the lines of locals. If you want to experience the real Singapore this is a great way to do that."
,,Europe Trip Stopover,5.0,,"We met up with a chef friend who works in a high end restaurant in Singapore. We told him we wanted to experience some real local food so he took us to Maxwell Road. First impressions count for a lot. Now if I had of walked in off the street by myself I would have turned around and walked straight back out. But as we were under the guidance of our chef mate we decided to stay and try. Thank goodness we did.

Our chef mate said you go buy the beers and I'll buy the food. So we bought a round of tall beers and sat back and waited for him to bring back some food. Well after a few minutes he came back with the first tray of food from one stall. Then a tray from another and another and another. I think in the end we had 7 different dishes from 7 different stalls. Rice, soup, vegetables and my absolute favorite meal was chilli frog. YUM!!!"

,,Cheap flavoursome food,4.0,,"I knew eating out was going to be expensive in Singapore so did my research on the Hawker Markets. We tried this one out first at lunch time & went to Ah Tai Haiwanese Chicken Rice stall. It was excellent. A large plate of flavoured rice, delicious chicken, greens & soup were only $6 & more fantastic there was enough for the two of us!"
,,Great Food!!!,5.0,,Near Chinatown there is this great foodmarket! Everything is wonderful bit cheap (except for draft beer). Just go there and eat!
,,Best chicken rice,4.0,,"One of the best chicken rice in Singapore can be found here. They serve original and tradition Hainanese chicken rice, in small ($3), medium ($5), and large ($7).Just get prepared for the long queues, though."
,,House the best Hainanese Chicken Rice!!!,5.0,,"Maxwell Food Centre is closed to the Chinatown MRT stop. It‚Äôs by far one of the best Hawker Centre and it houses the best Hainanese Chicken Rice in Singapore, Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice. The Center has so many authentic Asia food. It‚Äôs absolutely a must to go for delicious food! You won‚Äôt be disappointed."
,,Food Tourism In One Place Maxwell Hawkers Good Centre,5.0,,"the free breakfast in 5footwayinn is just light (coffee, cereals and bread and jam and apples which i am totally fine that coz its a hostel) and that made way to this 4 delicious food I had here at Maxwell. With my 20$ sg spare from the key deposit fee, i still have 5.50 SG$. I had laksa, peanut soup, hainanese chicken and chicken sambal rice and a coke. #foodgasm #maxwellfoodcentre #lonetraveller #igtravel #travelgram #Singapore #foodporn #igfood

for me its a dream come true, always see this place being featured or a location in a food or travel show, Maxwell Food Centre also makes your shirt smells food, its given that you will have foodgasm here. Its an eye popping and jaw dropping place, and probably you will experience a critical decision making in your life which stall to buy the eats and battling yourself if you are in diet or having an arthritis like me (im not on diet, hell that!)"
,,The real Singapore food,5.0,,"Want a taste of Singpaore ? Head to the hawker centre. Maxwell is just one of them. There are many around the island. In Maxwell you can find Tian chicken rice with the longest queue . Also pork meatballs in the stall nearby, and many more to spoil you
There is a Hindu and Buddhist temple nearby to visit, it is a must visit for all."
,,Overall average,3.0,,The food is quite ok..normal up to good but only bad things compare to the olden time b4 the mass renovation...the present Chairs and tables are extremely out of touch!! Sitting uncomfortable to have your meals...
,,A place for real Singaporean food,4.0,,"Some of original Singaporean food,such as Chicken rice, Porridge and Noodles are sold here.One Chicken rice shop is very popular and has a very long queue.It's best for breakfast and can be accessed by a short walk from Chinatown MRT station."
,,Eat with the locals,4.0,,"This was an interesting place to go for a meal, there were so many nationalities of food there that you couldn't possibly not find something to eat for everybody in your group. Quick service and decent food at good prices,"
,,Maxwell Food Centre Sisaket thai food,5.0,,"Tried the thai food dish 5B, so fresh, so authentic, really enjoyed the flavors.. need to go before the lunch time rush i guess .. went today around 11 am plenty of space and plenty of choices but this place gets a thumbs up"
,,A can't miss destination,5.0,,"Seriously, if you go to one food court, go to this one. Open air under a ceiling food court offering a variety of food options. Three of us ate here, 4 dishes, $28 US. Can't beat it. And the food was very, very, very good -- much better and much cheaper than hotel food. At the outskirts of Chinatown, easier to take a cab or uber here than to use the MRT and walk maybe a mile plus. ."
,,OMG the BEST,5.0,,"Please stop this food centre when you visit Singapore. Chicken Rice, fish rice noodles and sugar cane juice are MUST."
,,Tian Tian Chicken,4.0,,Many people came here for Tian Tian chicken rice and you will see a long queue for that particular store....
,,HAWKER FUUUUD!!!!,5.0,,"Favourite hawker of all time for anything Singaporean. Don‚Äôt worry about the long queue chicken rice stall - any chicken rice stall available is equally nice as well!!!!!

Eat the famous chinatown street popiah from the hawker centre and their teochew porridge with side dishes.

I‚Äôm so hungry now."
,,Â§©Â§©Êµ∑ÂçóÈõûÈ£Ø!,5.0,,"Â§©Â§©Êµ∑ÂçóÈõûÈ£Ø is very good to eat and you must try. However it is full of people and need to queue long time. Their rice are sold out fast. I went there at 10 morning, which is not queued so long time and ensure the rice is not sold out, and of course not so hot in morning, since there is no air conditioning but weather is always hot in Singapore! Maxwell Road Hawker Centre is at China Town and not easy to go. Go to Information Center and ask for the road is much better. Next time I want to try other food as well."
,,Great value food,5.0,,Visited for lunch after Singapore careless Sunday and had 3 very tasty meals and beers all for under $20. Excellent value
,,Maxwell Mediocrity,3.0,,"Looks just like any hawker center. Appears to be nothing special with the stalls inside. But, nonetheless, can be appealing especially to tourists.

But some notable points:
- many stalls have A rating in their hygiene evaluations
- fresh coconut is available COLD! (awesome)
- clean and neat
- Chef Ron is one stall that serves really good Ipoh cuisine (Nasi Lemak, curry chicken, etc).

Still worth your time when you don‚Äôt have specific specialty stalls in mind, but are merely looking for decent, inexpensive food."
,,Truly unique to Singapore,4.0,,"Scattered around Singapore are foodmarket known as hawker centers locally.
Among many, Maxwell is one of the better known location for many reasons.
1) being located near Chinatown, it makes it a wonderful extension to explore food culture.
2) famous chicken rice, visited by Gordon Ramsey is located within!
3)a popular dish which is fried banana fritters is one of the best locally with choices of different banana type (Raja‚Äôs the best) and sweet potatoes, champedak (a variant of Jackfruit)
4) a great variety of food from Porridge to noodles and stir fried dishes to cold salad local style, but predominantly Chinese inspired cuisine here.
Parking can be a chore as it is limited and as true to all Hawker Centers, it is very humid! So shorts and tees!
From there, you can explore Tanjong Pagar, Club Street, Kreta Ayer district easily in foot."
,,reasonable supper venue,4.0,,"Maxwell Road Hawker Centre is usually very crowded in the day, with the few famous stalls in there.

I went there for supper/late dinner after 10.30pm, namely for porridge. Hoe Kee Porridge still serves one of the best porridge around. The texture of the porridge is just right - not too thick nor too watery. It is also sufficiently flavoured, not too salty. For a very reasonable price of $3.50 per bowl, it is really value-for-money. The bowl is bigger than that served by the stall in Clementi Hawker or the shop in Tiong Bahru. Besides, for that price, the helping of minced pork balls and sliced pork in it is pretty generous, not just 2-3 slices. The mixed pork porridge also has reasonable amount of pork liver/intestines, slices or minced pork balls in it.

My husband and I also ordered a small plate of oyster omelette ($6) from the Marina South Oyster omelette stall. Helping was reasonable. What I felt could be improved was perhaps frying a little longer so that it is a bit crispier and not too egg-y taste. The oysters given was generous enough and tasted rather fresh.

Well, not very many stalls were opened at that hour. Still a decent place for a good reasonable supper."
,,Oh wow! Authentic food heaven.,5.0,,"Singapore is a very well refined city. However, for real authentic food, it is worth venturing away from the bright lights and polished restaurants to try real cuisine.

Authentic, wholesome and so so tasty. My dish was chilli spiced pork and sticky rice. Very easy to eat with chopsticks, and the flavours.... oh my word. Actually made my tastebuds come alive.

One thing I could not comprehend was the buzzing atmosphere. Everyone so incredibly welcoming and friendly. The vast choice under one roof mind blowing. It actually took about 20 minutes of walking round to decide what I wanted to eat. Worth doing as there is so much choice.

My meal and drink came $10.20. Extremely excellent value for money."
,,"Cheap food, local dishes and good experience",4.0,,"Don't expect fine dining or even a definite answer as to what is in the dish you ordered
Expect a lot of seafood
Expect amazingly cheap prices for good sized portions

Personally a fan of Char Keow Tow - I prefer panang style which is hard to come by outside panang, but the dish I got here gave it a decent crack!

Also had a coconut pancake + coffee one morning which was $1.50 for both!

Personally not a fan of any dessert options"
,,"Tian Tian chicken rice is over-rated. Try the fried black chaw keow teow, carrot cake and goreng pisange raja",4.0,,"Tian tian chicken rice is tasteless. No idea why people rave about it - poor quality rice unlike crisp, flakey and tasty version. The char kway teow and carrot cake opposite is a find - better CKT than other stalls in Singapore. The original pisang raja is sweet and crunchy - leave the paper bag open and it remains crispy for heating up in a toaster / oven. I will return despite the afternoon heat to sample a traditional stall serving grilled cuttle fish and brown stuffed tofu. I wish they would air condition the market"
,,cheap food good taste,5.0,,this hawker centre is good to visit really have all Singaporean food for you to chose and the price is so cheap
,,Spoiled for choice at cheap price,4.0,,"Centrally located near to Chinatown. Offers plenty of good food at really cheap price for people who don't mind the heat in the market especially in the afternoon. Porridge, Tian Tian Hainanese chicken rice and fish noodle soup are considered must try food."
,,Excellent Local Food,4.0,,"I loved eating at this hawker center! Just plan to spend a few minutes checking out all the food stalls before settling on one the first time you go there! Each stall displays the letter A, B, or C which is a grading system per the government based upon food quality, standards and sanitary conditions. I've mainly eaten at As and Bs. Grilled chicken with rice and salad was my safe bet. Just S$3.50 and I was stuffed! Tian Tian Chicken made famous by Anthony Bourdain is in this hawker center. Usually a line queues up round the corner for food from this stall. I wasn't patient enough on prior trip to Singapore but plan to eat there during this trip. There's an ATM for cash withdrawals at one end. I believe it's mostly cash only. There's an Indian food stall here with awesome parathas. I was hungry after dinner at a high end tapas restaurant and stopped in at the Indian food stall for 2 parathas for S$2 and was very satisfied. Would have just eaten here instead of tiny food at tapas restaurant!"
,,reasonable price,4.0,,This place is very convenient and affordable if you are near Maxwell business district and Singapore Chinatown. You have lots of food choices and very affordable like any typical food court...
,,Great food - cheap prices,4.0,,Apart from the locals this is also packed with tourists. It is like all your favourite chinese takeaways in one place and the choice of food is incredible. Because wok cooking uses intense heat the food is safe to eat and you don't have to worry that it is street food. This unique place also oozes atmosphere.
,,OMNOMNOM at Maxwell,5.0,,"Tian Tian Chicken Rice, Rojak, Pork Porridge, Char Kuey Teow, Oyster Omelette, Sugar Cane Juice with Lemon. 4 hungry people who ordered enough for 10 people. #noregrets

There WILL be a line for Tian Tian Chicken Rice but it's worth the 20 mins queue to tick it off your Singaporean food bucket list. #justdoit"
,,cheap & good,4.0,,can have a good varieties of choice and yet it won't cost you much. most famous hainanese chicken rice stall (Tian Tian) is located here too. just join the queues for cheap and good foods
,,Cheap and tasty!,4.0,,"Great option for a quick meal or to have a taste of several foods that locals have. They actually come to lunch during the week so it‚Äôs crowded, with lines but fast.
It even has a wc which makes it a great pit stop during the day.
Carrot cake is really good!"
,,"Varied, cheap street food stalls in covered market with emphasis on chicken fried rice.",2.0,,"Large assortment of stalls, each serving different regional foods, most with a rice or sometimes noodle focus, and also including shredded bits of chicken in various sauces. As we approached, having to walk 2 blocks to the back of the block lond, covered market, we were surprised be a line of 15 to 20 people standing outside. Was this an entrance fee venue? No, just the line for the most popular stall that serves fried rice with chicken. We were really hungry so tried othe stalls - noodles with pieces of chicken (bones still in) in a mildly interesting, slightly spicey broth. Also pad tai unlike what we've had from Chaing Mai to Chicago. Bottom line for us this culinary destination was way overrated and we regretted walking from the River to eat here."
,,Great food great prices,4.0,,Excellent food at budget prices like most places in Singapore you can eat safely here and enjoy the food the locals enjoy in one of the places the locals eat. Well worth a visit
,,Many Too Choose From!,4.0,,"My friend and I traveled to SG last August and we stayed in Chinatown. We Maxwell Food Center up the hill within walking distance from where we stayed. The place was big enough to accommodate crowed specially during peak eating hours like lunch time. There were many stall to choose from which cater mostly to Asian palate. The prices were reasonable as the servings were big enough. Cleanliness is always assured since there were cleaners who oversee the table and surroundings.

Will visit this food place for sure!"
,,Good place for local food,4.0,,If you want to try authentic local food it is always advised to go where the locals eat. This is one such eaterie and it didn't disappointed for a cheap breakfast. Would recommend for both atmosphere and food.
,,Cheap Good food in Singapore,4.0,,Whenever I craving for cheap and good food . I will buy from few of my favorite stalls in maxwell food centre because it is cheap . Please avoid lunch hour because there is always long queue. Long queue mean the food is yummy üòã
,,Something Excellent...Something Overrated...Something Mediocre...,4.0,,"Tian Tian Hainanese Chinese Rice was what we went here for, and it was excellent. But not everything was Michelin Bib Gourmand standard.

Among the delicacies at Maxwell that Anthony Bourdain praised was the Fuzhou Oyster Cake so we ordered two to try. It would have tasted better if the dough were thinner and the oysters inside more juicy. My sister also ordered char kuey teow, which was a bit mediocre, although the truth is that I do not find this dish special at all, whichever restaurant serves it. For me, the best ""dry noodle"" dishes are the ones prepared by our househelp Godging."
,,Super Great Singapore Style,5.0,,"I have been visiting this centre for well over a decade. Nothing changes in the centre itself but it is now in the middle of a super-sized massive MRT station build-out that is messing up the entire 'hood. But, today I had Chicken Rice and it was an awesome lunch, with great people watching, breeze and endless choices for add on snacks. Do not miss this centre and the surrounding area of course is famous etc. etc. I spent $7.00 in total and the quality remains awesome."
,,Outing,4.0,,"Good location and rustic place. Plenty of good food such as chicken rice, fish porridge, muslim food, dessert and many desirable food item. Reasonable pricing and frequent by many local or foreign visitors. Taste of local Singapore food and culture. Many amenities located within walking distance."
,,Ye ShangHai western food,5.0,,"Maxwell not only chicken rice,
Day have too many chicken rice stall.

Morning porridge, vegetarian stall ,dough stick, noodle stall, yam and pumpkin cake.

Lunch Roast pork and Char siew stall,
Curry Rice , fried rice ,traditional bah kut teh, thai food.

24h indian food.

Evening best would be the Ye Shang Hai western food.
Teochew noodles with very nice squid balls and fish balls.

Rojak and popiah springrolls."
,,Not quite michelin star worthy,4.0,,Is this place good? Yes Is it michelin star worthy? No. It's just soy chicken. Nothing special about it. I much preferred the soy sauce mixed pickled chilli noodles that come with the chicken. It's still worth a try if you're in the area.
,,More than just Tian Tian!,5.0,,"While Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice being its most famous stall, there are other great hawker stalls that have been renounced amongst Singaporean for decades as evident by the long lines. I could literally spends all day recommending them but for brevity sake will name a few.

In the event that Tian Tian is closed (Mondays) there is always it's 'rival' - Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice. Definitely try Zhen Zhen Porridge which serves mouth watering porridge cooked to perfection topped with all kinds of great ingredients. On the other side of the hawker Center from Tian Tian is another 'Hainanese' hawker cuisine Hainanese Curry Rice where you choose your ingredients for your rice and have it drenched with delicious curry gravy. There is desserts as well and you don't want to miss Xing Xing Ondeh Ondeh serving the island's best melt in your mouth Ondeh Ondeh Tapioca Cake. And not to forget the one and only Hum Jin Pang (fried Chinese pancake) where you get to fry your own Hum Jin Pangs! This stall is legendary as I remembered as a kid, buying from the old gentleman who has long retired when he was just a one man band in China Street. Thankfully his family is continuing his legacy. Another China Street alumni is China Street Fritters which has out of the world Nor Hiang (‰∫îÈ¶ô) ... boy I could go on and on but don't just read what I wrote but go and see for yourself and enjoy the food there."
,,Large variety and inexpensive,3.0,,"If u want a taste of every kind of Singapore flavour at very affordable price , this is the place to go ! No aircon and not restaurant standard cleanliness but soak up the Singaporean hawker food atmosphere !"
,,Maxwell Road Hawker Centre,3.0,,"Maxwell Road Hawker Centre is like any hawker centre. There is nothing out of the extraordinary. No special food to talk about. Go there for a meal if you happen to be in the vicinity. For tourists, well. Check out for yourself and compare with other hawker centres. If it is in the places to visit guide, then the writer knows something more than I do. I rather recommend eating at Peoples Park hawker centre which I consider authentic CHINA Cooked Food. You just need to eat there to have a TASTE of CHINA w/o going to China."
,,One of the Best Hawker Centres!,5.0,,"Maxwell Road Hawker Centre is definitely one of the best ones in Singapore! Good variety of food, and the quality at most stalls is great.

Excellent chicken rice and duck rice. Fantastic fried banana (goreng pisang). So much more. We don't live that nearby but go fairly frequently!"
,,Still a good experience.,4.0,,"We went in the afternoon. So the famous Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice was closed. We tried Hong Xiang instead in the middle aisle. It is just as great. The uncle is a bit slow in his chopping though. Expect to stand in line and wait.
Barakkath‚Äôs briyani is also good. Ask for extra gravy for dipping your naan bread."
,,Eat where the local eats,4.0,,"For all tourists, this is one eating place you must NOT miss. It's a hawker centre with many local stalls selling local cuisines, mainly Chinese food. The famous stalls are the chicken rice stall (selling steam chicken), Zheng Zheng Porridge stall (selling pork/pork intestine, fish or chicken/century egg porridge), fish noodle soup stall (just opposite Zheng Zheng Porridge), scissors curry rice stall (they use scissors to cut your meat into smaller pieces), etc. Food is very cheap here. Try to avoid the lunch period (12noon-2pm) or else you will have to bear with the long queues and looking high and low for seats. All stalls are self service, that means you have to collect your own food/drinks and cash payment only. This place is just right in Chinatown & very easy to find. After meal, you can just cross the road to visit the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple... a veey beautiful and serene temple."
,,Hawkers Rock!!,5.0,,"Ok, So, in each Asian country there is it's ""Own style"" of dinning.. Singapore is no different, EXCEPT that instead of ""Hodge-Podge"" stalls where you ""wonder""...The Stalls are ""Hawkers"", and they are more refined, but still fun and super yummy and they Rock!! Maxwell Road Hawker, is No exception, great dining and a real environment, one of the many many ""Muat-Eat"" places!"
,,Good selection of Singapore local food,5.0,,"We stayed at Scarlet hotel, so is only less than 5 minutes walk to the hawker centre, we had try dishes like Singapore version of nasi lemak, peanut soup, tau suan , mee siam, char kway teow, which is good and reasonable price as compare to others tourists area, price range from 2 to 6 dollars, which is fairly reasonable. Important is that's the local pay for it, unlike many tourist area, you need to pay double or more for the same items. Breakfast selections not so much, believe most stalls open for lunch and dinner."
,,Well located hawker center with good choices,4.0,,"This place is just adjacent to Chinatown and the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. There is a lot of construction going on nearby but there is a well-marked path to get inside.

There, you will find mostly locals wanting a quick but good lunch (or dinner). The place is abuzz with activity. It is just two areas of stalls serving food, or drinks or desserts; so you can pick and choose what you want. You order, grab your food, grab a seat and enjoy.

Low pretense, kind of frenetic, lots of people coming through, reasonable prices too it seemed. Lots of ethnic food too, not all Asian either so even more choices than I thought.

I went to Tian Tian and a few others. Hawker centers are not really my favorite thing but are huge all over Singapore. Still worth going for the experience for sure.
And if you had to pick one, this is the one to experience."
,,Maxwell Road Hawker Centre,4.0,,"My wife and I visited Maxwell Road Hawker Centre twice on our recent visit to Singapore during F1 week, it was only a 15 minute walk from the Village Hotel Bugis.
There was a wide variety of food choices on offer all very tasty and reasonably priced.

It comes well recommended !!!!!!"
,,Low cost authentic local food,4.0,,"You can find low cost authentic local food within this premise. Local food like chicken rice,curry noodles,porridge etc.... Avoid lunch crowd as most office workers will lunch there."
,,don't miss this!,5.0,,If you ask you can enter the hawker's stalls and watch your sugar cane water being pressed or your meal cooked on an enormous wok! Chicken and rice is a norm and delicious!
,,Great Hawker Food Centre,4.0,,"We visited Maxwell Road Hawker Food Centre on Sunday, it is located within walking distance of Chinatown (doesn't seem as far if you wander through the markets). There are many stalls serving Hainanese Chicken and they all have lines of people (especially the first one inside the entrance!!). We purchased some from a stall that wasn't quite as busy and it was great. There are many stalls selling other meals but this centre is certainly specialising in Haianese Chicken. A little hard to get a table as this is a very popular Hawker Food Centre. Worth a visit!"
,,Overall good,4.0,,"I went here during the Formula 1 season, I'm not sure how it would've been normally, getting a table was easy, (just remember hawkers usually do not provide tissues!) the lines are typical in singapore, just queues for the great restaurants and none for the not so good. Fans all around to keep the place flowing with air and wasn't too hot inside. Chairs are fixed to the ground too."
,,Reasonably okay Food,3.0,,"Went there after reading reviews, food is cheap and reasonably good depends what you order, so it is not every body's cup of tea."
,,One of the better hawkers around town!,5.0,,"If you want authentic local food, here's one of the best option to go to. The self-fried dough, porridge and fish soup are my personal favourites and recommendations!"
,,"Appalling - cheap, nasty, unpleasant food in a similar environment.",1.0,,"The romantic notion of a thriving, bustling hawker centre with a bewildering array of sights and smells to captivate the senses comes crashing down to reality with the Maxwell Road Hawker Centre. Instead, conjure up an image of plastic chairs, sloppily cleaned tables, and row upon dead-eyed row of vendors offering glistening, reeking, unappetising slop served in plastic bowls with still-wet cutlery. Now add in humidity, jostling and a wall of noise.

I sought refuge in a bowl of Thai green curry - it was the worst Thai green curry I've ever not finished.

Awful. Just, awful."
,,Cheap and tasty.,5.0,,"Okay, lots of food at cheap price! For muslims, Some eateries are kosher (serve no pork and lard) and vegetarian. Also, try their desserts (vegetarian). You can try carrot rice cake with black sauce (small is enough for you, 3 SGD)."
,,Did not like the food as expected,3.0,,"I had rice chicken at one of their most famous places, and rice was good but chicken was cold and hard to swallow."
,,My favourite Hawker Centre in Singapore!,5.0,,"The variety and affordable delicious food makes this hawker centre a favorite for locals. Not to be missed is the Tian Tian Chicken Rice, Zhen Zhen Porridge, the Fish Soup, the Banana fritters, etc... There are lots of local food to be tried here and they are all good!"
,,Excellent food because I am choosy,5.0,,"I live in two countries ,in the capital city of Malaysia ( Kuala Lumpur) and Singapore.So I can compare the food prices and costs.Most of the items here at this price you can get at KLCC food court at lower prices.We are eating here as a group.I am played smart and had only Naan with Chicken gravy which is free in price.Oddly the Veg dishes were priced.The gravy was very good and my pal shared with me and then I used my plain bread to eat more gravy.There was an instance of my first Naan fried with a big hole so a new Naan was made for me.Back to the place and seating...good overall but watch out for the prices.Always choose items based on the price and not on the advertised looks.
The only amazing view was the large ceiling fan that had so many blades.I wish I had taken a picture.
There are heaps of shops here and I got sort of lost in the maze of shops.It was in the afternoon.I might begin to wonder how the evening will be.Do try to eat less while on travel.
Later at night I took more gravy at another place without the naan so obviously the price was good.All in all the cost in price determines my taste and tummy."
,,Singapore food trip,4.0,,Very nice place to eat. Authentical food from different asian nations. For those who like Tom Yum soup it is the right place. Be careful - very spicey not to say hot but full of flavor. Prices extremly cheap for Singapore and quality very good.
,,The best sliced fish bee hoon in town,5.0,,There are so many kind of food in there but my fav is the sliced fish bee hoon with milk soup..the taste is out of this world and i certainly be back for more everytime i visit singapore üëçüëçüëçüëç
,,Maxwell Road Hawker Centre,4.0,,"If you love local cuisine, this is the place that you should not miss. It is centrally located within walking distance from Tanjong Pagar or Chinatown MRT station. You will be spoilt for choice as you'll be able to find chicken rice, laksa, fried kway teow, fishball noodles & many more local delights in this hawker centre. Worth paying a visit and I'm sure you will want to go back for more..."
,,"Delicious, different and cheap!",5.0,,"Always eat here when in Singapore. Food is exciting, fresh and delicious. Try the Hainanese Chicken Rice washed down with a cold Tiger Beer. Give the Rosehip and Carnation Milk drink a try. Satay sticks are awesome. Don't let appearances fool you. Worth going out of your way for and always eat where the locals eat too!"
,,Tops in the City Hawker Food Hunt for three years in running.,5.0,,"Maxwell Food Center.
1, Kadayanalur Street, Chinatown, Singapore.

Starting off as a wet market for the Chinatown area in the 1950s, Maxwell Food Centre is now one of the most frequented food centers by both tourists and locals. One can choose from an extensive variety of local authentic Singaporean cuisine with 3 back-to-back rows of 99 stalls. Despite its rustic exterior, the food centre boasts of a wonderful experience inside that feeds a contented crowd of food addicts. Stallholders are still working there through the generations and one of its most famous chicken rice stall has even beaten Gordon Ramsey in a culinary cook off. Maxwell Food Center was placed tops in the City Hawker Food Hunt for three years in running.

The most famous of all is the Tian Tian Chicken Rice stall that proudly display it awards. Jin Hua Fish Soup and Zhen Zhen Porridge also have awards to display and together there are eight other well known and well patronized stalls. A unique stall is named China Street Rickshaw Noodle at stall 87. It was originally a street stall selling economical no frills noodles that rickshaw riders frequent. It is now popular with the ordinary folks of Chinatown. Another unique one is the fried pancake stall that allows patrons to have a hand in frying their pancakes. At 6 (small) pieces for a dollar I would believe it is the cheapest in Singapore. The row that is facing Maxwell Road is ‚Äòreserved‚Äô for Muslim food and mostly Indian stalls can be found here.

When I visited the Center there was a hugh noisy built up area in front and at the side but as there are four entrances you can have access from the non affected sides. The
Thomson Express MRT station will be sitting next to the Center with a line running all the way to Woodlands North and in the very near future the line is to run all the way to Johor, when completed in the last phase. In front and opposite the road you can find and should not miss the large impressive Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. On the side opposite at Maxwell Road junction is a Church which was once a cinema for Mandarin movies. Someone died in there and two seats were always reserved for the spirit that used to haunt the cinema. And on the rear is the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) building. Maxwell Food Center is not difficult to locate."
,,Variety of local delights,4.0,,"Love The tapioca with coconut topping snacks! It's super soft even after several hours. other popular food includes the fish soup, spinach soup, chicken rice... Lots of tourists visiting the place too n there were occasions where our ""tissue chope seats"" was over-taken as they wasn't aware of this uniquely Singapore culture ;)"
,,Great food,4.0,,Very busy with many choices for great food. Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice is very popular. Best tip I could give is get there just after before the worker lunch time.
,,Good enough for Anthony Bourdain - Good variety of food - Tourists should visit,4.0,,"Review by Dr Sim, Good variety of food. Many stalls are good. Tourists should visit. No air-conditioned. Basic. Little ambience. Anthony Bourdain ate there. My favourite stalls are Tian Tian Chicken Rice and Porridge (cannot remember the name) which you can recognise by the long queue. Regards Dr Sim"

,,Good cheap Chinese Food at fair dinkum price!,4.0,,What you expect from a Hawker centre - variety of decent food and juices. Can feed the family for under $20! Handy for China town.

A must visit if you are around the Chinatown area (less than 5mins walk from the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple)."
,,Great food! Chicken rice,5.0,,"Maxwell road may not be the best hawker centre in Singapore but it was close to where we were and I wanted the kids to experience chicken rice. The food was delicious my Singaporean friends have always said if there is a queue it it worth the wait, so there we waited. I know it's just chicken and rice but the kids thoroughly enjoyed it and both used chopsticks. It was about ¬£12 to feed the 4 of us."
,,Hot,1.0,,It was hot and no ventilation. Must do something to improve. The place was dark even though it was a hot afternoo. The food was expensive. Will not go again.
,,Singapore Popular Dish - Haninese Chicken Rice,5.0,,"Hey! there You can find one of the Best Local Food in Singapore here.
Our very famouse Haninese Chicken Rice - our very own creations and ther are a few store selling the same local chicken rice, but you need to taste them all to find the different. Tips - can be the chilli , How different the rice is cooked and tastey depend on your taste buds. The tenderness of the chicken and the way the stall owner/Hawkers sharing with you how to eat your chicken rice or should I say the steps to starting your food or rice. They can be to add black sauce an accomplement to the rice first or the chilli and even the fine blended ginger sauce or the pounded gingers depen on the stall or hawker recommendations. with different steps you will find and savour the different.
As for me = straight up with a spoon of Rice to find how fragrance is the rice before any thing else; but of cause there must be ginger and or sometime the Chicken rice chilli that is also with ginger, this chilli ginger juice makes the different..You will love and the taste linger on.........."
,,Lots to choose from,4.0,,"First time at the Maxwell Rd Hawker Center, was surprised how big the center was and the number of stalls, too many... we stopped for lunch around 11:45 am by the time we finished our meal and drinks which was around 12:30 it was really busy most of the tables were occupied, we had three meals between the two of us which was plenty and tasty, if your out for a quick, cheap and tasty meal make sure drop into the Maxwell Rd Hawker Center, the fresh fruit drinks were also yummy and refreshing."
,,Great street food experience,4.0,,"We went to Maxwell on the day after Chinese New Year. So not all of the stalls were open that day but there were still plenty of good choices. Notwithstanding its prime location (very central to my understanding), the prices were really reasonable and the variety of different cuisines was very wide. Don't forget to take a beer - nothing goes together with some noodles as good as a local or Thai beer."
,,Great food,5.0,,"We visited here twice so far, and both times went to stall No 71 fantastic roast duck and pork with either noodles or rice, the man on the stall is so friendly and this stall had the biggest queues by far. Very cheap and tasty"
,,Probably the best in town,5.0,,$8 kong bou claypot frogÁî∞È∏° $6 Seafood omelette without eggÊµ∑È≤úÁÖé $3 big bowl porridge! Friendly hawker operator. All delicious and cheap. Will come back again! $1 mineral water 600ml
,,Eat local fare at local rates,4.0,,"Maxwell has much more food varieties to offer than just that particular Chicken Rice. A sure sign that it is no longer as local as it should be is when more tourists queue for it than locals. Recommended below are the stalls that opens till late everyday. Not the usual afternoon ones.

1st stall to recommend, Hoe Kee Porridge serves a hearty cantonese styled porridge. You can choose different ingredients to be cooked with your porridge like lean pork, century egg, pork liver and pork inards. They also make their own tofu, which is fried and served with their in-house sauce, spring onions and fried shallots. They also sell claypot frogs legs or claypot pork liver in Gong Pow sauce. Their serving is huge and the porridge is dense, not watered down. Their porridge and special tofu goes for a standard price of S$3.50 each. If you would like to add any other ingredients, they are S$1 each. The same stall also sells steamed buns, chee cheong fun (rice noodle rolls) and an array of fried dim sums. What's better is that they are opened daily from 7am to 3am with occasional off days.

2nd stall to recommend, Tong Xin Ju (Special Shanghainese Dumplings)
This stall is not a native of Maxwell Food Centre but was originally from Margaret Drive Food Centre. Must tries are their GuoTie (ÈîÖË¥¥), Steamed Dumplings (È•∫Â≠ê) , Hot & Spicy Soup (ÈÖ∏Ëæ£Ê±§) and Shanghainese Rice Cake (‰∏äÊµ∑ÁÇíÂπ¥Á≥ï). For the GuoTie, have together with their vinegar and their special made chilli sauce. The Hot & Spicy Soup don't need to add anything other than vinegar, if you prefer more sourish flavours. The Shanghainese Rice Cake is good as it is. If you mix their chilli sauce and vinegar into the rice cake broth, you will end up with a slightly lesser version of their Hot & Spicy Soup. Prices goes for S$4 for 8 pieces of GuoTie or Steamed Dumplings. Hot & Spicy soup or Shanghainese Rice Cake for S$5 for the smallest size. They operate for lunch, dinner and supper time.

3rd stall to recommend, Ye Lai Xiang Tasty Barbecue. Another stall originally from Margaret Drive Food Centre. They have been known to have queues starting before they even start their business. Queues usually form when the shutters are halfway up. (Means the owners are finishing the preparation and going to open soon) Must tries are their old school Hainanese pork chops with brown sauce that is different from any other pork chops that you will have ever eat before. They also serve steaks and chicken cutlets. All portions are generous (Pork Chops comes in 3 slices and the Steak thick) and prices starts from S$6.50 onwards. Their food runs out as fast as they open the stall. Be prepared to wait for 30 minutes at least during peak hours.

4th stall to recommend, Teochew Rice & Porridge. The standard Teochew Porridge fare you find everywhere with difference in flavours. Must try the minced pork and picked vegetables. The rest is up to your selection. Pricing will depend on what is ordered. If fish is ordered, usually will be more expensive. Be prepared to wait for up to 40 minutes in the queue as people do take their time to place their orders.

5th stall to recommend, Juice Farm. They serve great fresh juices at affordable prices like ABC (Apple, Beetroot and carrot) at S$2.50 and Watermelon Juice at S$2. Their juices are not watered down, sugared up or filled with ice to reduce costs. They occasionally add honey into the juice if you want them. Fruit juices are a much better alternatives to can soda drinks anyway."
,,Great Hawkers market,4.0,,So much choice of excellent Asian cuisine at cheap prices. My Indian choice was Indian served on paper on a tray. It was delicious. You can't go to Singapore and not try one of these food markets.
,,"Stall 71, well worth the wait.",5.0,,"We were near Maxwell Road Hawker Centre at dinner time so popped in. Stall 71 had a queue of about 15 people so we joined on the end. Was it worth the wait ? Too right it was ! One plate of roast duck noodles and one mixed meat rice were purchased for the ridiculously low price of sgd 7.50, such a bargain as the quality was superb. Not far from Chinatown if you are in the area."
,,Eat like a local,5.0,,"Good place for cheap eat. There are a lot of choices ( more than 60 stalls) in Maxwell likes fish soup noodle, Japanese ramen, curry, chicken rice, laska, singaporean dessert, freshly squeezed juice,etc. Most of the main dishes are around SGD 7. Please noted that the food court is not air-conditioned. The peak hour for lunch starts at around 12 on weekdays. Make sure you arrive early (better befort) 11:30) to get a table and order food before there are long queues."
,,Cheap and cheerful,4.0,,"Not everywhere is cheap to eat in Singapore but you certainly can't complain about the prices at the Maxwell Road Hawker Centre. We enjoyed sharing some Hainanese chicken (best I've had), dumplings and craft beer. A perfect dinner! But there's plenty of choice and it's easy to eat here as a group as everyone can be catered for by the many stalls selling many different types of food and drinks."
,,"My favorite for local food, good & cheap!",4.0,,It remains my favorite for local food. Everything freshly coocked and far from becoming a touristic spot like Lau pa sat is doing. Not far from Chinatown and close to the nice old building district of duxton rd area.
,,A Touristy Spot with Touristy Prices,3.0,,"Having been born in Singapore, food has always been one of the themes that would emerge even before each meal began. It was always ""What are we eating today?"", or ""What do you think we should have today?"" an hour before a time remotely appropriate for eating our meals. Perhaps the ravenous urge for the consumption of food comes from our utter boredom with the monotony that living in Singapore is, and perhaps this is also the reason why we love congregating a variety of food stores together that bear food that could possibly tarnish our waistlines.

Newton Food Court has all of that waistline expanding criterion, and more. If you are into touting (illegal as it is), it is the perfect place to be at. Shaped in a colosseum-like circle that reminds one of the Ancient Roman's love for gladiator sparring, the food court possesses the same vibrant and energy of a Flavian Amphitheatre in the late evening. But while instant death is involved in those arenas, slow death through the clogging of your arteries with lard-infused food permeates this particular scene.

Some of the more notable food products that are cardiac-worthy would be the Satay, Hokkien noodles and Beef Noodles.

My verdict is this: Eat if you have the waistline to spare."
,,"So many choices, cheap and yummy",5.0,,"My favorite lunch place .. tried many things and love mala, porridge & fried tofu, noodles with fried dumpling ... just to name a few.
It's not so drama to find a seat if you are not in big group (less than 4) during lunch hours."
,,Good place for cheap Singaporean food,4.0,,"We visited Maxwell Hawkers Centre on our Chinatown walking tour and were told that this was the place to go for Hainanese Chicken Rice and that since we were early we would beat the rush before it all sold out.

It was also interesting to learn about the rating system for each of the Hawkers stalls and how they are inspected and regulated to ensure cleanliness and the safety of the food. Basically each Hawker stall is rated A, B or C but will seldom see many C‚Äôs as I think we were told they get shutdown to rectify the issues if rate C.

Anyway we survived with after effects."
,,Great chicken rice and oyster cake,5.0,,"There's a wide variety of local dishes. It's known for chicken rice: loads of tourists are lined up at Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice. Apparently, they beat Gordon Ramsay in a cook-off.
TIP: If you don‚Äôt wanna line up for Tian Tian, AH TAI CHICKEN RICE is just a few meters away and his chicken rice is cheaper by S$1. The chicken rice is great, and he also used to work for Tian Tian.
The oyster cake in the food center is also good!"
,,Where locals eat,4.0,,"You have the chance to try different local dishes for a rather reasonable price (2-5$).

We had a chicken curry, seafood fried rice and some satay skewrs. All was good.

Not as crowded as other hawkers. There is no outside dining! It might get a bit hot."
,,Awesome place for food,5.0,,This is one of the best places in Singapore that houses almost all the local flavours that Singapore has got to offer. Some of the stalls here have a long history. Gordon Ramsay even came here to steal some tricks. Definitely a great place to fill that tummy!
,,Looking for lical food at a old district,5.0,,"Maxwell Road Hawker Centre is one of the many oldest food centres located at a very intetesting district of Chinatown n Tanjong Pagar.
Chinese hokkien noodle, Fied kueh teow noodle, Laksa, Malay mix rice dishes (Nasi Padang) Ayam Penyet, Indian Rojak, Indian fried noodles, Prata n Murtabak Indian pancake) some of the food and many more.
You can walk across the street to the Old Ricksaw Station building n Buddha Temple. From there you can stroll down to Chinatown. There many budget hotels in that area too.
Nearest metro station is the Tanjong Pagar Station and Chinatown Station.
Dont forget to visit this place in the city atea."
,,LOVE THIS PLACE,5.0,,We were staying in a hostel just a couple of meters away from this place and we ate almost all of our meals here. I love that some stalls stay open until late at night though you only get few options. I love how diverse it is inside.
,,Yummie!,5.0,,"Its loud and crowded here, but the food is really delicious and the prices are low. If you want to try real singaporean meals you have to eat here!"
,,Interesting,3.0,,"We were there at lunchtime so it was very busy with all the workers who were dining and it was a little hard to get around to all the stalls with long cues everywhere
- however once we decided on our choice of cuisine - one went looking for somewhere
to sit and the other one stood in line - they have a very funny way of ""reserving"" a
table - if you see a small packet of tissues on the table - it is ""taken"""
,,Great variety of food but rather stuffy inside,4.0,,"The must try items are:
1) ngor hiang prawn crackers
2) handmade soya bean curd with gula Melaka/ginger syrup
3) Tian tian chicken rice
4) seafood white beehoon sold by the stall selling spinach soup
4) handmade tapioca kueh and kueh kosui

All tastes very good but the place is rather stuffy and hot that's all."
,,Lots of great stalls!,4.0,,"Zhen Zhen porridge is my favourite... And in my opinion, the best porridge in SG. Thick, and with really fragrant toppings (preserved veg, fried onions and scallions) - perfect breakfast and only $3 for a small bowl, which is actually pretty sizeable. Hock Lee does great snacks; tapioca chips are my favourite. He Wei Zhou do great handmade fried tofu, which is another favourite here. The famous chicken rice here is alright too. Wouldn't say it really lives up to the hype it gets, but worth a try if the queue isn't too long. Lots of things to choose from here and most are really good - best thing, it's very affordable compared to restaurant dining. Really worth a visit!"
,,Iconic Hawker Centre,4.0,,Its big with lots of choices and a few outlets starring with long lines and pics of famous people (LKY) visiting. Was here 10yrs ago and again recently - love the atmosphere despite the heat and crowds üòäüëçüèº.
,,Very pleasant experience,4.0,,Any food hawker centre is a good time to experience local foods for a fair price and meet fabulous people. The workers seem to love what they do. Making the entire experience a delight. I look forward to my return.
,,Variety of food at cheap rate,4.0,,"Lots of food at cost effective rate, mingle with locals, feel the hustle and bustle, first rate food, great Chinese, Thai, and you must try Tiger beer! Or if you need a cool drink try the local lemon tea & fruit mixers, loved the mango juice drink."
,,Visited with Sneakpeak Singapore Tour Group,3.0,,"I was keen to try local food at a hawker marker and I got the opportunity as part of the Sneakpeak Singapore Tour. Our tour guide brought 3 different types of local dishes to our tables to sample. We tried Hainanese Chicken & Rice, Fried Carrot Cake (a tasty savoury vegetarian dish flavoured with blackbean sauce, it's not Carrot Cake at all!) and Popiah. Food is very inexpensive, no frills dining, if you know what you want."
,,Stop going to Marina Bay Rasa Singapura,5.0,,if you want the real deal come here. don't go to that overpriced food court. you won't ever experience real hawker street food there. this is where you want to be. not Newton. here. amazing variety of sights smells and tastes. this is the where you get real Singapore food.
,,Spoilt for choice,5.0,,"You can't really go wrong with any hawker centre, the choice is so big it's hard to distinguish which one is better. Maxwell is obviously great."
,,Local Hawker Fanfare,4.0,,"There are great local hawker fanfare in this Market. Especially the middle rows of the market. If you are looking for a variety of choices, this will be the right place."
,,Absolutly great choices!,5.0,,I had a great time.choosing food around all the stall my favourite was Sichuan hot pot on the go ( owner is from Sichuan).and after that a coconut icecream.cone and tapioca cakes ( this 2 stalls are in front of the Sichuan atall). The juice stall is fantastic too: nice fruits and veey clean. You can buy fruits by poece too!. Food heaven!
,,Something different.,4.0,,"At this Maxwell road hawker center, tourists may taste a few outstanding local cooking like the famous chicken rice, mee sam, mee reebus. A number of stalls are available to provide many choices and seatings; however avoid lunch hours (12 noon) as the place is also popular with office staff working in the vicinity. This attraction is reachable by public transports. After a meal, one can walk across to the chinatown and other icons nearby."
,,Local food near the CBD!,4.0,,"hot, sweaty and busy!
Excellent choice of local Singapore hawker cuisine, however some will be closed at different times of the day!
Like many places, go for the stalls with the longest queues!
Value for money and you get a taste of most cultures in Singapore!"
,,Simply the BEST,5.0,,"There is one question to ask any traveler to Singapore: ""have you eaten at Maxwell's?""
If they haven't, they have missed one of the better collections of hawker-style food outlets in this wonderfully food-obsessed society. This is a local venue, serving local food at local prices . . . and the variety for someone not yet accustomed to Singapore hawker markets is mind-boggling. As we prefer to stay in Chinatown whenever visiting Singapore, it's always breakfast at Maxwells . . ."
,,Lunch.,4.0,,"This is a great stop off for cheap,tasty food that is served in large portions. Love how the stalls have hygiene ratings. Avoid during peak hours,unless you like waiting for food and waiting to find a tableüòâ."
,,Christina Ang,5.0,,"Cheap and tasty good food. Always go there for authentic traditional food that cannot be found in other hawker centre.
Rickshaw noodles at $1 per bowl. Side orders are flour coated deep dried prawn @$0.30 per piece, ngo hiang @$0.20 per piece. Ngo hiang guang Chang is another stall that I do not miss whenever I am there. I will ""ta pau' home for my dinner. There is a 'hum chim peng' stall where you do the frying with super long chopsticks yourself. Another of my favourite is the ondeh ondeh which sells out around 12 p.m."
,,Delicious food,5.0,,"I visited Maxwell Hawker Centre twice. A few dishes worth trying - Tian Tian Chicken and Rice, Zhen Zhen Porridge and Maxwell Fuzhou Oyster cake... The line to get to Tian Tian was insane but the wait wasn't as long as I expected.. There is a reason why the line is ssoooo long.. The chicken and rice dish really lives up to all the hype !!! There are so many other dishes I'd love to try so I recommend going to this hawker with a big group so you can try a bit of everything..."
,,Best Food Ever In Singapore,4.0,,"My daughter took us to this center to eat all sorts of satay. We ordered mutton, chicken, beef and shrimp, which were huge by the way. The marinade that was used was awesome. Price was right and the beer was cold. Tip: If ordering a beer, if there's two or more of you, get the pitcher of beer. A lot better value. Awesome walking around and seeing your food cook as well. Surprisingly, the mutton was not gamey at all. Everything was so fresh and so good. Do not pass this up!"
,,Nice place to eat.,5.0,,"Great place to eat with a lot of seafood options, I had the oyster omelete, wich you can choose 3 diferent sizes. I had the biggest one, and it is a lot of food!! I like to eat, and I use to eat a lot, but I could not finish this omelete, even though it's delicius. I would recommend it."
,,Awesome Selection,4.0,,"We visited here early this year at the suggestion of every guide boo, travel program, and locals. The selection was awesome and every palate is accommodated. Some of the food is amazing, while others are not so amazing. Some of the food we got was even undercooked (Not good for chicken). All three of us left stuffed and were even treated to a craft beer at one of the stalls. Will definitely visit next time I am in Singapore!"
,,Very cheap food.,4.0,,Amazing variety of cheap food and drink well worth a visit. Dress for the heat though ! Easy walking distance from Chinatown and surrounding area. Some construction disruption around the centre but still serving.
,,Love,5.0,,"It is near my workplace, and less stuffy as compared to the nearby telok ayer market (amoy street market)
So many good food around!

Here are some of my favorites
1. Jin Hua Sliced Fish Bee Hoon - personally i like the sliced fish noodle, there's always the fried fish
2. Hoe Kee Porridge - fried tofu is awesome! claypot pork/frog leg is good for sharing. i usually order fish or lean meat with century egg porridge. Shorter queue compared to the very good Zhen Zhen porridge
3. Hainanese curry rice - pork chop is my absolute favourite. try the standard combo : pork chop, fried egg drizzled with dark soya sauce and braised cabbage
4. Xing Xing Ondeh-Ondeh Tapioca Cake - try them all! ondeh ondeh, kueh kosui, tapioca cake
5. Zhen zhen porridge - long q, awesome porridge though never filling for me.

Do try and let me know if you agree !"
,,A great place to eat,4.0,,"Maxwell Road is a peoples place to eat, you can really try what the locals in Singapore really eat, there are so many stalls to eat and try, the different types of food is just amazing, for me the best time is breakfast, I like to fresh porrage, its fantastic, you walk away saying that you must return again, most times you do."
,,Chicken Rice,5.0,,We went to the famous chicken rice hawker stall. There was a massive queue but moves fast and definitely worth the wait.
,,Excellent food at an amazing price,4.0,,"I've commented on previous posts about Hawker Centres in Singapore but Maxwell Road Hawker Centre is worth its own review. This centre on the edge of China town is excellent. It has a huge range of outlets with a hugely diverse range of food. We had Chicken rice, the classic dish which is simply that Chicken and rice. Don't be put off though, the flavour is amazing and for $5 Singapore amazing value. Whatever your tastes you'll find something here. I also tried a very unusual combination of fried fish served in a spicy sauce with sesame seeds and a century egg. These are black eggs with a grey-green yolk, reportedly aged for 100 years. It's an acquired taste as it has a subtle ammonia flavour, like a mix of egg with aged Camembert, unusual and needless to say my wife and son thought they were disgusting, I on the other hand thought they were a unique flavour and part of the culinary delight of Singapore. The centre is always thriving, bustling with Singaporeans and a truly fascinating dining experience. If you're on a budget these places are a must because they're so cheap, if you're not they're a must because you get to eat some excellent food with local people. Service is fast and efficient. Don't forget to tip the cleaning staff a few dollars, you'll make their day."
,,Tasty food adventure!,5.0,,"We visited on a Sunday morning, staying for lunch. It is a bustling, noisy place, filled with amazing food stalls selling all kinds and varieties of foods. The fact that the Hawker centre was chock-a-block full of locals was a great recommendation!! We opted for some Hainanese Chicken from Tian Tian shop - great, but you will have to wait!!! The queue goes on for a bit!! Well worth stopping by the centre for lunch or dinner - highly recommended."
,,Worth the hassle,5.0,,"Maxwell Road is currently a bit of a building site, and presumably will remain so for a while longer as an MRT station is being constructed there. Therefore, getting into the hawker centre is a bit of an exercise, but there are signs and (usually) plenty of locals to take cues from.

It's worth the inconvenience, too. Most of the stalls are open during the day only, so make it a lunchtime visit and you'll have your choice of plenty of good options. Tian Tian Chicken Rice and its nearby offshoot are justifiably famous and have very long queues, but there are very few bad choices around here. Even just a couple of the banana fritters are well worth it."
,,Maxwell Silver Hammering Great Food Market,4.0,,This is the place to go for GREAT food in Singapore. Many good stalls in my opinion usually operate till late noon. Special mention to those with China Street stalls as they were from the old street in the heyday of the 70's Singapore. It's an old market - no aircon so be prepared.
,,Delicious and exciting,5.0,,I loved the wide range of food available that is all good value and absolutely delicious. I would recommend it to everyone.
,,Yummy food,4.0,,"A traditional hawker style food center with plenty of choice. We tried rice and noodle dishes and soy bean milk and desserts. Try it and you will be full and have money left over, not easy to find with the current works but worth the effort."
,,Surprise at the low prices!,4.0,,"Though it was just after 8 am this stall was already doing well selling noodles and kuih to cyclists, locals and some travellers like us. It was really cheap and the same for the next door hot drinks too."
,,Must do,5.0,,"One of the last of the original hawkers cenres, great food, cheap beer and cheerful stall holders. Highly recommended if you want a taste of the Singapore of old"
,,Lots of delicious hawker food to be found here,4.0,,I ordered a fish and prawn soup from one of the stalls and was amazed at how reasonable prices were compared to some other fish soup stalls. The seafood was fresh and 2 or 3 dipping sauces were available. Great value for money.
,,Gordon Ramsey lost in a cook off here,4.0,,"Great place to eat, such a wide range of choices and the prices will make you wonder why you paid so much else where.
Eat stall only has a few dishes, but they have been perfecting them for years, so you get top quality food. Stalls are also checked by the regulators and receive a A to D rating, you won't see a D as that means close down for 2 months.
As a tourist go out side local meal times if you want a seat, most stalls open 11:30 for lunch.
It is like a large food court, but with really good food.
There are also drink and desert stalls.
TV Chef Gordon Ramsey lost in a cook off with one of the stalls.
Well worth the visit a must do."
,,Maxwell Hawker Center,4.0,,"With lot of good food, maxwell hawker Center is a little small but the food here with reasonable price, especially during lunch time, here is forever crowded, with bus stop nearby about 2mins, cross opposite is Chinatown, convenience location, love the food here."
,,Great choice of good Chinese food stalls,4.0,,"The Maxwell Road Hawker Centre is a colourful covered downtown location where there is a great choice of competing stalls providing a variety of Chinese foods at economical prices. Nothing particularly fancy - but certainly authentic! The market is patronised by many local people, which is a good sign for visitors to join in!"
,,"Great selection, good food.",5.0,,This is a street style food court that is very popular with locals and tourists. Hainanese Chicken And Rice was excellent and worth the wait as there was a long queue. They are building a new MRT station outside so it is a little to get to but worth it. It is also very inexpensive and a good choice of cusines to choose. I highly recommend this place for a meal.
,,ÊúâÈªûÈÅ†‰ΩÜÂÄºÂæó,5.0,,"I go Maxwell Road Hawker Centre from the Chinatown Station, I think it is a little bit far, but the hawkers there are good!!! Â§©Â§©Êµ∑ÂçóÈõûÈ£Ø, ËÄÅ‰º¥ÂºÑËä±, È≠öËõãÁ≤â, very good!"
,,Taste Singapore,5.0,,"The Hawker markets have a huge range of authentic foods. We stopped and tried a few and they were full of flavor, absolutely delicious and very cheap. Don't go around peak periods if you can help it, because they are extremely popular, and when you try it, you will see why. No need to worry about getting Bali belly, ur not in Bali. Everything is fresh and made daily. Their English is not so good at some of them, but they get around that barrier with easy. Very enjoyable."
,,Good food,4.0,,"We enjoyed our visit to this hawker centre, so many stalls with loads of local food. We enjoyed a meal, some cold drinks and the hussell and bussell of the place. If you see a vacant table with a packet of tissues on it it means the table is reserved."
,,Is not a tourist attraction is a food court,4.0,,"Don't get caught up in the hype thinking that you are going to see anything else then people enjoying their food and chatting. Maxwell Hawker Centre is not a tourist attraction. That aside if you are like me and you travel for food then this is a must stop. You are going to find a lot of tasty dishes some good some awesome, don't hold yourself back.

,,Overrated,3.0,,"No idea why this is such a ""must eat"" spot in Singapore. Its hot, crowded and the food just typical hawker food where you can get the same quality at an abundance of other cheap hawker centres in Singapore.
I had the chicken and rice and it was average. Hit up the hawker centre in the chinatown complex instead!"
,,Great Variety of Asian Foods in A Vibrant Atmosphere,4.0,,"This is a great place to bring any visitors to Singapore
The good is very good with a wide variety Washed down with a few cold beers. Superb
There really is something for everyone
I like it at night where the hustle and bustle is at its best"
,,Great atmosphere and good food,4.0,,"We visited the Hawker Centre on an evening looking for authentic street food and thought it was great. The chicken satay is fantastic, the varying aromas, coupled with the hustle and bustle of the place create a really vibrant atmosphere. Great fun!"
,,Maxwell hawkers,4.0,,"The day i arrived at Singapore coming from HK we had lunch right before coming here. I was so full but I love eating so i ate anyways. I had an order of rojak, popiah, and of course Hainanese chicken. It was tasty and i thought this food center was amazing(I later found out there are many other ones that are bigger)."
,,Chicken rice is awesome,5.0,,Went here for the Tian Tian chicken rice! Flavoursome rice and chicken was super tender. Love it!! Would be back!
,,Warm environment but good location for affordable local food in the City/Chinatown/Tg Pagar,4.0,,"It's very crowded between 1130 and 1330 hrs - lunch period for workers from surrounding offices. Avoid this period if you don't wish to rush with the crowd. Currently, lots of construction due to new mass rapid transit (MRT line- Singapore subway system - causing inefficient ventilation so can be hot inside the hawker centre. Hot favourites are distinguished by the long queues of customers such as chicken rice, roast pork/chicken and fish soup. Food prices (exempted of taxes) are displayed together with pictures of the dishes but please note the pictures are professionally done so should be deemed as representation of the dishes.
Seating (fixed tables and seats) are shared so expect strangers to take the empty seats at your table. Also there's a local practice of seat reservation a.k.a 'chope seats' where diners place umbrella, paper tissue packets, name cards,etc mark the reserved seats or one of the diners will sit at the table to indicate reserved seats.
I recommend a 'cheap/inexpensive and good' 'yong tau foo' store - less than S$4- can get adequate meal of vegetable, toufu (soya bean) stuffed with fresh minced fish meat. Look around the diners to get a sense of the food portions so that you don't over-order your food. I seen foreigners ordering too much food. Most hawkers can speak English and they are fluent in Chinese (dialects and Mandarin) and Malay language. A typical meal - a main dish and a drink/dessert - should cost about S$6-S$8. Most stalls are opened by 10 am. Some stalls are opened for breakfast, too."
,,good hawker in chinatown,4.0,,"good hawker in chinatown, has decent selection of food, one of the best stalls inside is Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice."

This food court is always full of people, of course it's one of the favourite spots for tourists. The busiest time are between 12-2.30pm. Prepare to long queue and difficulty in finding seat during lunch time.
Tried the chicken rice, fish porridge, bean curd drink and local dessert ( tapioca and pumpkin), yummy."
,,Great spot to try a ton of food,5.0,,"Maxwell Food Centre is my 2nd favorite Hawker Centre in Singapore. Granted, I was only able to visit 5 of them, but we hit up a lot of the highest rated ones and most recommended by locals.

Of course, you have to try the original Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice, but make sure you also stop by Zhen Zhen Porridge, Special Shanghai Tim-Sum Tong Xing Ju, & China Street Fritters."
,,"Cheap, cheerful and excellent food!",5.0,,"You can't go wrong here. There is an abundance of stalls open from morning till evening and you will get a feel for the most popular from the lines!!

There are 3 aisles of stalls. Great dumplings in the first aisle closest to maxwell rd (our miss 4 gave these the big thumbs up)
Famous chicken rice in the aisle closest to Erskine st ( one is open at night and one in the morning)

Great juice stalls and a craft beer stall as well!"
,,Huge variety of food of 1st class quality,5.0,,"Although there is no air conditioning at Maxwell food centre, but for all the good food, it is the place to go to.

,,Good hawker food,4.0,,"This is a typical hawker food center, where you can find chicken rice, char kway tioa, soups, porridge, all kinds of drinks. There are Halal, Chinese, Thai, Malay and Indian foods. Prices are very cheap. There is a lot of construction going on nearby at the moment but it is sill business as usual in the center."
,,back again after a couple of years,4.0,,"The Tin Tin chicket rice is tasty and delicious. We (4 of us) have order an entire chicket for late lunch. We have a great lunch with various yummy food taken.
Try not to come during peak hours due to long queue with many people moving around.
However, if you come too late (after 3pm), some shop will take a break before dinner time."
,,Still good to visit,4.0,,"They are doing road work at the moment for the new train station, expect noise and dust. Other than that it is still a good place for a cheap eat. Shop around for those stalls with good rating."
,,An unusual but fun experience!,4.0,,"Dumpling? Satay? Noodles? Fish? Hainan chicken and rice? All are possible options at the Maxwell Rd. Hawker center. We were not sure what to expect, but it was a lot of fun and our choices of pork satay, and pork and dumpling noodles with veggies were great. We would have tried one of the stalls for Hainan chicken and rice, but the line kept getting longer and longer....a good sign! Our one way cab ride was more expensive than our dinner, including two beers! We understood from locals that this was a good Hawker choice, and we cannot disagree!"
,,Ms,4.0,,"Bought the pumpkin and carrot cakes from one of the popular stalls there. Quality not so good @$2.50 per portion. Lack the authentic favour, can be better. There are plenty of local food stalls there. Probably I didn't try the good ones yet."
,,Hup Kee Wu Xiang Guan Chang,5.0,,"Food here is very delicious, Wu Xiang ingredients are different from others. They are home made and very yummy. This food business has been around for more than a century. If you are around this vicinity, you should give it a try :)"

,,Great food for dirt cheap,5.0,,One of my favorite things about Singapore was the Hawker centers. These are outdoor food courts with a plethora of local food that's ridiculously cheap and seriously delicious. I had the chicken rice and it was amazing. The place is a mix of tourists and locals and you can get lunch there for less than $2 USD.
,,Authentic hawker food,5.0,,"Cheap, tasty and quick. Well worth the visit to see where the Singapore local will go for a cheap meal."
,,Our daily staple for 1 week!,5.0,,"Absolutely love this place. My partner and I visited at least once a day for our entire week trip in Singapore. Morning was a fresh baked bun with many variety of fillings for $1, a cup of coffee also $1 and a fruit salad for $2 that kept us going until either lunch or dinner when we would head back for a rice/noodle + meat dish for $4. Most food is great some good and some average but you quickly learn what you like and where the locals eat from. Don't expect the place to be spotlessly clean and it's hot as it's outdoors but cold drinks are on sale for $1 - $2 each and you can sit beneath a fan at a table. No need to tip but if you really enjoyed the meal I'm sure the vendor would appreciate your repeat business or an extra couple of bucks. WARNING: this place is not for fussy eaters or people who liked to be wined and dined. Real food from real locals for locals alike. 5 stars."
,,Great if you are on a budget,5.0,,"Great food. In fact we had our best Laksa here. Meals average around $3 AUD. We will be back. We walked from uptown and found the centre very easy. It is just past China Town. It is worth a visit, paritcularly if you are on a budget. Singapore can be expensive, so this is a great way to save money. All of the Hawkers were very clean."
,,Best eating ever,5.0,,"Maxwell is a famous hawker centre, always busy, right in the centre of town. Don't be put off as it looks so chaotic, take your time look at all the stalls and if you are unsure of what to eat, stick to the chicken or duck rice, delicious. Noddles also very good, of course there are some strange sounding dishes, but hawker centres cater for the population not foreigners but be brave and enjoy the food. It is cheap, plentiful and you can feel part of the community. When a bit braver try some of the more unusual dishes, carrot cake, or mea goreng lovely. I always go to the hawker centres for lunch when in singapore. Chinese, Indonesian, Indian and regional dishes are all there including Halal stalls, so give it a go."
,,Best Chicken Rice,5.0,,"Try the chicken rice from Tian Tian Hainanese - you'll need to queue but it's worth it. Reasonable prices, good selection and great food."
,,Good food for the traveler on a budget,4.0,,"Conveniently located just next to Chinatown, this hawker (food court) offers a variety of Asian foods on a very low budget. Generally you can eat here (well) for a budget of 2-4 USD per person."
,,Singapore's iconic food centre featuring great local food,5.0,,"This is one of Singapore's iconic food centres that both locals and tourists go to. You can find all types of local food - chicken rice, fish soup, porridge, ngoh hiang, oyster pancake, curry rice and more. You have to visit several times to try all the yummy food!"
,,I'm hungry for Hainanese Chicken!,5.0,,Are you hungry and looking for a good and cheap place to eat? Maxwell road hawkers area is the place to be! Try to order the Hainanese Chicken rice at Tian Tian. It's a never fail chicken recipe that's already world renowned for it's flavor and consistency. Now go and eat! Now I'm hungry again!
,,Food court,2.0,,"Nice and cheap food court in China town area. Heaps of stalls with lots of traditional food. Got the Hainanese Chicken, traditional dish from Singapore. Beautiful"
,,Definitely a Must-go in Singapore,4.0,,Dun missed out the famous chicken rice called Tian Tian chicken rice. There are really quite alot to eat there and I recommend to slowly explore.
,,At least a third of the food stalls were closed on a Saturday night!!!!!!!!!!!,3.0,,"Made the trek to get here and arrived at 7.30pm after walking through Chinatown only to find at least a third of the food stalls were closed. I was disappointed as I had particularly come for the 'famous' Chicken Rice and both the Tian Tian and the Ah Hin stalls had the shutters down! Ended up getting a pleasant meal at Hong Xiang which did the trick. Not sure why so many places were closed on a Saturday night but I wouldn't come back. The atmosphere, like the surroundings were dull and dreary. This place is definitely overrated. Next time I'll go to Lau Pa Sat."
,,"Big selection, good food, minimal ambiance",4.0,,"Maxwell is famous for chicken rice, among other things, and it's busy all day long. One of its standout virtues is that some of the stalls are open late - great for noshing after the bars. But at peak times, finding a place to sit is far from easy."
,,Local hawker market,5.0,,"Eat where the locals eat ...busy,busy ,busy and so cheap for delicious food ,online this market has great reviews and the quality of the food was excellent"
,,Great selection of food in this food centre,4.0,,"We always come here for the five-spice stall that has been in operation for a few generations. The main issue here is the parking space (or the lack thereof). Once you've managed to park your car OR if you don't drive, you'll find yourself at the next hurdle - getting a table! Because of this, we often come during off peak hours i.e. not breakfast / lunch / dinner time. Good luck!"
,,Julie Buttery,5.0,,"Maxwell centre is a great place for food , day or night . Very reasonably priced , super delicious . Try food stall number 12 , we had beef curry with crab bones stew with chillies on the side , $24.00 (Singapore dollars) or ¬£13.00 for 2 people , sounds weird but utterly delicious. We went back the following night and had the same again. Allso Ho Peng coffee bar for large Tiger beer $6.50 (Singapore dollars) ¬£3.56 ."
,,Cheap eats and plenty to satisfy,5.0,,The food was extremely filling and varied. Very cheap meals and if you don't want a meal choose certain dishes to make up your own. There's plenty to choose from and at the prices they sell eat all you can is definitely an option ;)
,,More Than Just Good Value,4.0,,"We had heard about Hawkers and Maxwell Road did not disappoint. The choice was amazing. The value was unbelievable and experience is not easily forgotten. The only problem we had was selecting which outlet to go to, but generally the one with the biggest que indicates a favourite preferred a by the locals."
,,Long lines for the most popular places,4.0,,"This is a food court (like in a shopping mall), except it is outdoors (but under cover), with many shops offering their particular specialty. Yes, the Tian Tian chicken draws the most people, but there are many different shops. To us, the big draw was not the food (which was just so-so), but the relatively low prices and large servings."
,,Hawker!,4.0,,They have the famous Tian Tian chicken here which is the main draw of people. I tried the oyster pancake which was good but not amazing. Also I tried the popiah which was again not bad but not out of this world.
,,Local food with great atmosphere,4.0,,"Arrived at lunch time , where everyone sits or stands to eat. Three corridors of fast food, made on the premises. Very noisy. Great Buzz. Meals are cheap, provided on plates if required, with knives and foods.
Plates are cleared away.
Should a bottle of water , or tissue packet be on the chair it is a reserved seat/ Cultural issue.
Sit where you can!
A must to see the local life and taste a selection of food, from curries, rice, chicken, bananaa fritters."
,,Nice food court,4.0,,Lots of food and juice stalls. Among them is the famous chicken rice. You can get kaya toast and coconut juice too. Good for a quick lunch.

,,Good variaty and nice quality,4.0,,"One of the famous/touristy foodcourts in Spore. Plenty of choices of nice quality food at cheap prices. This hawker center hosts Spore's oldest Western Food & Steaks Stall (est. 1976 or something like that) for almost half an year now there is also a craft beer stall - very good beers, must try! :)"
,,"The best Hawker Centre, surely!",5.0,,"We found this by accident as we stayed nearby. Then we found out it is one of the best in Singapore. Something for everyone's taste, but do try the carrot cake - nothing to do with what we call carrots, but it's delicious, especially for breakfast. Great prices, too."
,,Great Food!,5.0,,Anthony Bourdain and Gordon Ramsay have eaten at this food court so it must be good. Maybe 10 minutes from the Chinatown Food Market.
,,Very crowded with locals. Always a good sign.,4.0,,This place is always very crowded with locals which can only be a good sign. It's crowded and vibrant and the food is varied and tasty.
,,Foodie's delight,5.0,,"If you like excellent, cheap local food on your travel adventures then make sure to visit the Maxwell Road Hawker Centre. A couple of the stalls have a bit of a rivalry with regard to their Hainanese Chicken Rice.... I think both are excellent."
,,Hawker Houses,5.0,,Very good choice of foods at all the Hawkers. Get the real taste of Singapore Cruisne. Eat like the locals.
,,When you need Chicken Rice!!!,4.0,,"When I need my hit of chicken rice, then Maxwell Food centre is the place for me. Fresh, tasty and oh so cheap. We always get here a bit before the lunchtime rush and always get a seat and quick service. Our favourite chicken rice shop is Hong Kong Hainese‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
,,One of those food court located inside the CBD,3.0,,"We initially was going to go for lunch in Lau Pa Sat but the taxi driver took us here instead and told us this more local and authentic Singaporean. The famous Tian Tian chicken rice is located in this food centre. We unfortunately missed it as they happen to be close on the day we visited. If they are the main reason you plan to visit here be sure to check which day they are closed to avoid any misfortunes. There is a large selection of food stalls. And each food type there could be up to 5 different stalls that sell the same thing. Chicken rice, laksa and skewers are all over the food centre. I think the food is average but exceptionally cheap. This place is perfect if you are looking to get involved with the Singaporean food centre scene. None of the food we had were exceptionally good nor exceptionally bad. The location of this hawker centre makes it quite an easy access as it's very close to the financial district and CBD."
,,Good Food and Value for money,5.0,,"Mawell food court are near to Chinatown. I was really pleased to see the food court are very clean, hawkers mostly very friendly . Food serve here are delicious especially the chicken rice and all value for money."

,,Something for everyone!,4.0,,"A bustling, thriving food court in Chinatown. Many different cuisines to suit all tastes.

,,Great food for very little money.,5.0,,"Singapore has a reputation of being expensive but you can get great food, cheaply at a hawker centre like this. Most of the stalls have english menus. Each stall has a hygiene rating given by the Singapore government. Me and my family managed to find something that everyone liked."
,,Reasonably priced good food,4.0,,"If you're looking for authentic yet less expensive food, this is the place for you. A wide variety of food selection is available. It is also a good time to meet other people as you really have to share table with them."
,,Great variety,4.0,,"We had never been to a hawker centre before and when we got there, there was an overwhelming choice of food stalls open to us. All the food looked brilliant so we took the advice of our many guidebooks and joined the queue that was the longest! The Hainanese chicken rice that we had was superb and full of taste- you can see why so many people go here for a quick and tasty meal. We then sampled other foods such as pork dumplings and spring rolls which were equally as good. All in all, a good, tasty lunch option."
,,Very good Hawker Centre,4.0,,"Location is key for Hawker Centre and This one has great location not far from Chinatown. It is MUCH more pleasant to access by the main road than back entrance which greets you with very stinky trash area. This Hawker Centre has a great mix of choices from Thai, Dim Sim decent Western, chicken rice, Noodles, it is difficult to go wrong. TIP: sit the closest to the main road in the open with fans it is the best location. Favourite food there is Thai place at the extreme left when you have you back to the main road. Bon Appetit!"
,,So yum,5.0,,This is the best place in Singapore to get some very good and ver cheap food. Ate here a few times. Had some really good chicken rice.
,,Pls avoid No. 34 juice stall,5.0,,"We went to the food court just for the most famous Tiantian Hainanese chicken rice on 20/04/2017 at around 2:30pm, was sitting in front of the No.34 juice stall where it is right opposite to the chicken rice stall, my husband went to get me an ice sugar cane drink( not in stall 34, because we had tried their sugar cane juice before, it has no sugar cane flavour, 80% just water) , the owner ,a 50 year old woman stares at us right away once she see us put down the sugar cane juice which was not purchased form her stall, and rudely told us don't put our handbag and back pack on the chairs, she said we occupied too many chairs , the whole food court has plenty of empty tables and chairs , and everyone is putting their belongs on the chair, and she only barked on us because we didn't buy the sugar cane juice in her stall, she continued shouting and yelling us at least 20 minutes, saying we are selfish for taking too many seats( my handbag on 1 seat,my husband's back pack on another seat, total 4 seats we took, and it was not in the peak time of the food court, we were there at 230pm), lots of empty tables and chairs around the foot court at that time. She has to pick on us because we didn't buy sugar cane juice in her stall. I love Singapore for everything, I general think majority of people are very nice and friendly. Obviously I wasn wrong!"
,,Singapore Culture,4.0,,"This is one of the better hawker centre in Singapore in terms of tasty food. Every 3 months all hawker centre in Singapore will have a complete cleaning which the stall cannot operate for 2 days and thus it will maintain a certain standard of cleaniness.

Maxwell market has many good food stalls like - Tian Tian Chicken Rice, infact all the chicken rice stalls are tasty, Fish Porridge stalls, Rickshaw Noodles, Peanuts Soup, Tim Sum, local desserts - kuehs, fried pancakes, Shanghai Foods like dumplings, shanghai noodles , mee pok etc....

It tends to be hot and crowded thus is better to go for early lunch like 11a.m. Pricing is cheap depending on what you order."

So try stall No.7, virtually as good. There are so many stalls to buy from so see what you fancy and give it a try. The China Street fritters are tasty prawn fritters and fish cakes etc."
,,Cheap,3.0,,"Food is very cheap. Most main dishes average at about 4 sgd. it seems to mainly open for lunch as limited places open at around 6pm. The staff are brilliant, very friendly and polite. Food itself isn't brilliant. Edible but don't expect anything outstanding"
,,Tian Tian,5.0,,"Heard rave reviews about the Hainanese Chicken rice so I went to see what it is was all about. When I got there, there was a queue about 40 people long so I joined it. The meal for $S5.30 was all it promised."
,,Great Atmosphere...,4.0,,"Some interesting dishes found here, a must raved about 'oyster omlette' and the unusual tasting 'popiad'! All dishes reasonably priced. The guide book said it closed at 10.30pm, but was well on it's way to closing at 9pm.... Get there early!"

This food centre boasts some very popular stalls like Tian Tian chicken rice, Zhen Zhen Cantonese Porridge, Fuzhou Oyster Cake, Jin Hua Fish Soup, China Square Hum Jin Peng (Chinese dough fritters), China Square Lor Mee etc. My personal favourite is a unique dish not ordinarily found elsewhere - Rickshaw yellow noodle soup, a sort of comfort food for many older generation Singaporeans.

A very good place for entertaining visitors from overseas to give them a Singaporean eating experience.

Do note that most stalls operate for breakfast and lunch only."
,,Amazing value,5.0,,The hawker centres are the places where locals eat in Singapore- amazing value and brilliant food! Maxwell Road is famous for chicken and rice and well worth s visit. A meal will cost around 5 dollars and the experience is well worth it.
,,Foods are still nice there,4.0,,"Currently there is construction project next to the Maxwell Food Centre which did affected the business as most though it's closed.

Food are good and reasonable price, but don't go there too late as most of the store should be closed after 10pm.

It's walking distance from Chinatown and nearest MRT station is either Outram(EWL), Tanjong Pagar(EWL) or Chinatown(NEL)."

Get there before 11:30 or after 1:30 to avoid lineups at the most popular stalls and get a seat at a table.

I was looking for a place which made Wok prepared food, but ending up with noddles and fried dumplings and a drink made by a mix of yogurt and grape fruit. I enjoyed both the food and and the drink.
I will for sure visit this food court again next time I am in Singapore and I am within walking distance to this place."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Visited here a few times for food while staying at Fragrance Hotel Riverside. It was about a ten minute walk, easy to find, and well worth the effort. The food was fantastic, cheap, and plentiful. All washed down with a cold tiger beer."
,,An experience not to be missed.,4.0,,"At the hawker centre you find a table the order your food from one of the many stalls. We were advised to watch which ones had a line and choose from there. Everything was tasty and cheap, as long as you happy to eat in the noisy atmosphere it is fun to try it out."
,,One of the best hawker centre in Singapore,5.0,,"Maxwell Hawker Centre.....One cozy place for lunch or dinner in Singapore.

,,Excellent local street food centre,5.0,,"An interesting array of street foods that are fantasies to foodies where there are varied cuisines and Asian fusion food to enjoy. Its street food and so fairly economically priced, but more importantly there are many interesting choices and all of very good standards. Tian Tian chicken rice has one of the highest recommendation where even Anthony Bourdain had raved about it."
,,Good food. Cheap.Not fast.,4.0,,"We went to the maxwell Road hawker Center because we had heard about the Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken rice.So we got into the Tian Tian line and waited.From what I've heard, you always wait. Was it worth the wait? You'll have to decide that. I can tell you that we enjoyed the dish. Chicken very tender but the rice was really really good.
Got the vegetables too.also good. Also got an oyster omelette from a stand 4 or 5 stalls down which was also very good. had to wait a little for that because the one cook there makes every dish to order.If you're in a hurry go to another place to eat but if you want really good food at a good price, the Maxwell Road hawker center is definitely worth the trip."
,,Nice,4.0,,"This place is worth visiting if u r into street food, especially if u r craving local food. After u finish, don't forget the sugar cane juice üòãüòã"
,,Amazing variety of cheap eats,5.0,,We tried a bunch of different dishes here all were really good and cheap. Cheap beer too. Wait staff to clean up empty bottles and food trays / plates.
,,Food court for lunch,3.0,,"If you are looking for a cheap lunch in Singapore then head towards Maxwell food court near China town and only a short walking distance from Tanjong Pagar MRT. There are variety of Chinese, Malaysia and Indian food stalls that will cater for all but not if you are looking for Western food. I particularly like the fruit and juice stalls where for less than 5 dollars you can fill a plate with all sort of fruits on displayed in the cooler. Only warning I will give is arrive early, after 12 noon the place is packed and you would have to wait for seating."
,,Good food at great prices.,4.0,,Have eaten here a couple of times. Good food you know it's where to eat when the local community flock there!
,,A Singapore food institution.,4.0,,"I was lucky enough to go here with a couple of locals, and it was well worth the visit. So much to choose from. But do follow the locals they know where is best. Had the fried oyster cakes, an awesome drink plus some other goodies. And super super cheap. Well worth a visit if you want to taste authentic chinese singaporean cuisine."
,,Looking for local cuisine,3.0,,"While walking around the Chinatown in Singapore, Maxwell Road Hawker Centre came up and we headed to find the place. The first impression was this was an old food court with a lot of food shop. Unfortunately less than 40% of the shops were open. We ordered chicken and mutton satay. There were delicious, well seasoning, soft and tender. Must try."
,,Very tasty chicken rice,4.0,,Maxwell Road Hawker center is the best place to find tasty chicken rice and fresh coconut juice. It is just opposite Singapore city gallery.
,,Authentic food,5.0,,Great local find. Authentic food.... Best Hainanese Chicken Rice Great value And down-to-earth service
,,Famous Chicken Rice,4.0,,Really need to try this one of the famous shops in the Centre. There is always a long queue outside the shop. The price is reasonable and you need to go early because the chicken rice is sold out quickly.
,,Lots of varieties!,5.0,,"Maxwell food centre is a must visit with lots of fantastic food!. Lots of typical local food to hunt down! The tapioca local kueh (cake) is the best even though friends tell me that there are better ones! It is soft and to me the texture is just right!
The oyster cake is fragrant with powerful ingredients! $2 seems too much compared to before but it is a difficult search for this type of local cake. The roast meats especially the duck is great but there's also a queue!
Although there are plenty of chicken rice stalls, there seems to be always a queue for ""Tian Tian chicken rice"". Tried it and must say that the rice is good or.. maybe I was super hungry!
What about the others? Well there are lots to explore and in Singapore, when there's a queue, it must be good!"
,,Little food gem,5.0,,"I somehow found myself Wandering, and came Across the food centre. Let me start by saying the variety in choices n types of food is unbelievable. I ended up going with one of the only Thai food stalls in the market and let me tell you i enjoyed every bite of the meal. Had the Thai basil leaf meal with no meat. Also found a small little tea shop within the market n ordered a Thai coconut tea smoothie. Strongly recommend checking this place out (spend time going through the different stalls to see the options first then pick a place, lunch time mon to fri this place is packed)"
,,A famous and amazing food court,4.0,,"It is situated near the MRT ""Chinatown"" and convenient to go there by 10 minutes. A new MRT station is constructing by the side of the food court, so it will be more convenient later.
There are many varieties of food types including the chicken with fragrant rice, desserts and drinks. Foods are cheap and delicious.
However, the food centre is rather hot. Yet, it is clean."
,,"Fantastic food, great price.",5.0,,Maxwell Road Hawkers corner is a great place to eat. Good variety of foods including award winning Hainenese Chicken. It currently has lots of roadwork around it as there is a new train station being built. Definitely worth the time to find your way in and have something to eat.
,,Food Galore,3.0,,"for a taste of singapore. try this place.things to look for

1. chicken rice - Tian Tian chicken rice. cannot find the stalls, look for the longest queue ! chicken is succulant and the chilli sauce a must to have

2. Teochew Oyster cake - deep fried snack that brings back good old memories

then finish it off with a large cup of sugar cane juice with lemon. that completes a meal below 10 dollars"
,,Makan at Maxwell,3.0,,To avoid during office lunch hours due to many offices around there. Many stalls with long queues. Obviously those are the more popular ones.
,,Food Court FOR Every Taste,5.0,,"Way to much to single out here, I had my first coffee here at 5.30 AM cost 70 cents, most food plates from $3.50 up so my advice is to try as much as you like, We did not have anything we didn't enjoy"
,,Amazing,4.0,,"I loved this place. The first Hawkers Centre I've ever been to and it was fantastic. Cheap, delicious and bustling. What an experience. I'd go again and again but I'm back in London now and am craving chicken-rice. I also found all the stall-holders very friendly and helpful to a newbie like me.
Locals might have other favourite Hawker Centres but for a tourist like me it was a great introduction."
,,So cheap you won't believe it!,5.0,,"This place is full of locals so that shows how good it is. There are so many stalls to chose from, you are bound to find something that takes your fancy. And it is so, so cheap - especially considering how expensive Singapore restaurants are! We bought lunch here and then went back for more food around six (don't go any later or your I may find all the stalls shut?) In total we spent about ¬£30 and that included beer money."
,,Just go!,5.0,,"Holy smokes, this is the THE place to get cheap, tasty eats! We had the Hainan chicken and rice because we were told it is just something you need to have if you are in Singapore. Are we glad we did. There are lots of food choices at this place and what makes it nice is that it is sort of outdoors but is covered over so if it rains....who cares?! You'll be dry!"
,,Many choices,3.0,,"The hawker center offers many food choices. Some were amazing, others okay. The center is crowded and loud. The prices are much cheaper than in the Chinatown food Street. But it did become an touristic place.
If you walk away from the touristic places, you can find restaurants with better/equal prices. If a lot of locals eat there, you can expect it to be good."
,,you'll need to go more than once!,5.0,,"5-star review for a $5 meal? yes, sir!

well I think I spent over $10 because I went back for more

you can't go wrong here. there are dozens of stalls with so many choices. chicken and rice, noodles, thai, malaysian, halal, and on and on. grab a table with some friends, a couple of large bottles of beer or coconut water and chow down. have to come here at least once every time I'm in SG. and walking distance to Chinatown where you can go for dessert!"
,,Ah Tai has the best chicken rice!,5.0,,"Tian Tian is the top name when it comes to Singapore chicken rice, but Ah Tai, which was set up by Tian Tian's ex-cook, has the better version, in my opinion. You get better tasting chicken, and for the same price you get a bigger serving, soup, and all 3 sauces. Admittedly, the rice offered by Tian Tian is better, but I wouldn't trade it for Ah Tai's chicken.

The best hawker center I've been to in Singapore. Don't forget to try it! Just make sure you go there early (before 8pm) since many stalls close by then."
,,Duck noodle maxwell,4.0,,"We like to noodle texture and generous size of meat in Maxwell duck noodle shop, they also have barbeque and roasted pork noodle/rice"
,,Disapointing : take 2 min walk to China Town Food Street instead.,3.0,,"Having read the reviews, we decided this was the best hawker market (food center) to try.

Maybe, were a little early, I don't know, but many of the stalls were closed.

We immediately noticed the famed Tian Tian Chicken Rice stall. This was the only stall with a que. Thinking we should try the local delicacy we ordered.

While the chicken was amazingly smoothand tender, both it and the rice were very bland/tasteless. Also the food was barely luke warm.

I accept that we should have explored the food on offer more extensively.

Due to the lack of stalls open there was very little atmosphere.

However, China Town is very close... China Town Food Street is full of stalls cooking hot food to order. ATMOSPHERERIC

TIP: Forget the Maxwell Road Centre take a 2/5min walk to China Town Food Street."
,,Good value local food,5.0,,"We wanted to try local food while in Singapore, we visited China tow in the afternoon and had planned to eat at Maxwell Hawker stalls. Due to roadworks it was not as straightforward to find as expected but clearly signed so no problem.
Lots of choice and prices very cheap , unlike everything else in Singapore. We had noodles and chicken and pork and fish, only 9 dollars with a large tiger beer to share ar 7 dollars. Food was delicious and freshly cooked fantastic value for money and a great experience"
,,Very Good,4.0,,Very good for the food I've manage to eat that day but would suggest that some stall owners to starts operate earlier.. Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice starts at 10.00am while the Fish Noodles only available at 11.15am
,,Simply good and without tourist hassle,4.0,,"Found this hawker center by chance on google maps. When we took a cab the driver said it's a good choice because it's frequented by locals which want good food for a good price. And yes food was very good, fresh and prices low @ 3-5 S$ per plate. To top it off there is a booth that has 11 craft beers on tap.

There is a place called ""chicken and rice"" towards the end left in the right alley that has a constant number of people lining up. It's the one the taxi driver recommended specifically.

It's not a cosy place but the food is good and the prices a bargain."
,,Traditional,5.0,,"Everyone says Singapore is expensive but if you are willing to experience local food and daily life this is a fantastic place. Lunch time with the local workers descending on it are really busy but you get to see an unusual sight-mobiles left on tables while owners go and get there food from one of many stalls! Stalls include traditional fried chicken rice, satay, fruit stalls drink stalls. Amazing and cheap. 3 dishes and a jug of beer for less than ¬£
20."
,,Very local choices,4.0,,"There is local craft beer, warm Rojak pancake, and succulent Hainan styled steamed chicken. The place is full of surprises that you normally would not find in a regular restaurant, I mean, those assessable to tourist. Some of the hawker centres are becoming very touristic and are stocked with very international dishes only. This one at Maxwell Road is still keeping its charm and is a must visit place if you are want the original cuisine in Singapore."
,,Authentic experience,4.0,,We enjoyed our meal here and the chance to try and the real Tian Tian chicken rice. We went just after lunch time so the queues weren't too long and there were seats available at the tables. The centre is quite clean and there is an enormous variety of food choices. Well signed once you find the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple.
,,Local place with good food.,4.0,,Have been here before and decided to go back as food very good and it's so authentic. Very busy so grab a table when you can. Have a look round before choosing the first thing you see. We had Hainese chicken rice which was very tasty. Poached chicken with rice cooked in chicken stock. Give this place a go! Very cheap.
,,Delicious,5.0,,Foodie extravaganza. There is so much choice difficult to decide what to eat what not to. Could come here time and again and still not cover all you want to eat.
,,Great food,5.0,,We went here with another couple & we all enjoyed our selections. It's busy but the vendors are friendly & helpful. And the Laksa we had was really good. Definitely visit Maxwell Rd Hawker Centre.
,,Busy place good food,4.0,,"Great place to visit and see all the different types of food on offer. Had the local chicken and rice washed down with a tiger beer both where very good. Reasonable prices and a great selection of foods, was spoiled for choice."
,,Authentic Local Food,4.0,,"Close to China Town, this hawker market offered lots of Asian authentic food fare. Fantastic value for money, no frills tables, chairs and cutlery just great selection of dishes. We shared Thai and Cantonese dishes and ice cold bottles of Tiger Beer."
,,Yummy hawker food at great value,5.0,,"Great place for sampling many of Singapore's hawker food in one convenient location. Typical outdoor hawker/food court feel, with many good choices for chicken rice, popiah, char kway teow, hokkien mee, sugar cane etc.

Considerably clean. Must note that some stalls close after they've sold out for the day, so go early for dinner to avoid disappointment. Great value for money."
,,Best Hawker Centre to experience local food,5.0,,"Maxwell Road is considered to be one of the best hawker center to experience local foodfare and I certainly do not deny that. There is a good spread of food varieties and if you are unsure of what to order, just look for the queues. You can try chicken rice there, fish soup and so many. So remember to pay a visit there."
,,Eating hawkers style,4.0,,"This is the only way to enjoy real food with real locals. So much to choose from,the mind and taste buds tingle. The hard part is working out what things are and making a decision,but thats the fun part.Cheap and no added taxes for this that and the other.
The selection and variety makes the mind boggle,so take the plunge and enjoy."
,,The Best Hawker Center in all of SE ASia,5.0,,"Get Your Taste Buds Poppin'...Maxwell Hawker Center has so many options available that you can eat for days! The chicken n' rice is really good, as are the pork dishes and anything bbq'd. I was recommended this place by two locals, once at the airport upon arrival and then again at my hotel. The meals are quite budget friendly as well. Had lunch once and dinner two times! Great place to have a meal and people watch as well!

If you've ever been to Malaysia...the food here reminds me of Georgetown in Malaysia! Options for everybody!"
,,Terrific food stands - great quality,5.0,,"Maxwell Road Hawker Center offers delicous versatile Asian food at the food stands. Eating out at the Hawker Center is a lot of fun, you're at the pulse of Singapore within a vibrant abd terrific atmosphere. The food is of great quality. Value for money!!!!"
,,Good spot to eat,4.0,,I found the center a little hard to get to from where I was staying but if you're in the area it has a great variety of cheap eats and is worth a visit.
,,If you scare hawkers - here everybody can go and will love it!,5.0,,"As many traditional hawker places in Malaysia closed, this is a perfect place to discover and enjoy the hawker food. One of the cheapest places to eat in Singapur. And every single place is so delicious. Very, very good. A must!!"
,,Living like a local,5.0,,We ate here several times as the centre was only a short walk from our hotel. The food was so fresh and delicious. Very budget friendly prices and quick service were a bonus.
,,Maxwell hawker centre,2.0,,"nice ""you teow"" go with both teh and coffee tareh less visitor due to under construction mrt station"
,,Lunch,4.0,,"Best heritage food court in Singapore. You must try the oyster cake, Ngoh Hiong and oyster omelette."
,,Yum yum,4.0,,"We had the BBQ stingray , it was delicious. Also had the cereal prawns .. very yummy. Both these foods were recommended to us by our hotel ."
,,ENDLESS FOOD OPTIONS,5.0,,"Maxwell road hawker center is a must experience. Translate hawker center to food center. Made up of individual food stalls selling all variety of foods of every type. There are 260 different stalls to choose from. An inexpensive way to try out new foods. People watching is a free bonus. Highly recommend, Hope this helps."
,,my visit,4.0,,Great value and excellent chicken rice despite other comments. Easy to locate and reach by MRT. Cheap and cheerful and great atmosphere
,,Great cheap eats,4.0,,Had lunch here a couple of times. Both times the food was very good and cheap. About $6 AU. Eat with the locals and you won't be disappointed.
,,that's what I call a Street Food festival!,4.0,,"As a German 'Street Food Festival' means: ppl put a super nice and fancy stall. You pay commission just to step foot inside. The food looks good, but is so highly overpriced you think double before you order anything. Mostly it's fastfood that got a bit of an up touch. Like a hotdog with black bun or a burger with shrimp. To Asians this isn't anything special you would pay entrance fee for and an additional 8,50‚Ç¨ / 70HK$ / 12S$. Here at the Hawker Centre you get anything you wish for, except for western food, which is great. When I travel I do not want to eat the stuff I get back home. I want to experience local cuisine. Singapore is so multicultural, you will have to choose from many, many, many different cuisines such as Malaysian, Indonesian, Chinese, Indian etc. Of course these food stalls aren't always the cleanest, but the food is great! Non of us had any problems with the hygiene. But if you want to make sure, most stalls have been proofed for the hygiene and cleanliness of the food and rated from A-F. A being the best condition. My favorite out of all these Hawkers have always been the Juices! All fresh and with pure fruits. No added sugar or anything else. Go for it!"
,,Just Amazing,5.0,,"we had lunch here, had Singaporian springrolls, they where so jammy there are heaps of people, but every body is nice to each other, which is SO nice to se. we can only recommend it, we had a ball"
,,Disappointed,2.0,,"The hainan chicken is terrible, far from as ok! Not fully cooked and no taste at all. We left that place in a hurry and will not go back any time soon."
,,Cheap but great !!!,5.0,,Went to maxwell hawker centre & it was a great experience food was great & so cheap 4 of us ate for about ¬£15 absolutely super value recommend to anyone drinks also reasonable went about 9pm not so busy then try it you will enjoy !!!!!
,,"Shouldn't complain, food was excellent!",4.0,,"Wanted to love this place. After reading such great reviews, must admit the food lived up to its billing. Negatives first... Lots (more than half) of stalls closed when we visited at normal dinner hour. May have to do with construction going on out front, but still... Also, long lines for the more ""famous"" stalls, so we didn't even bother. Upside... everything we got was great - chili prawns, laksa, mee goreng, satay, fresh pressed fruit juices... everything. Something just seemed off... a solid 4/5, go for food but don't expect much more,and be ready to go with the flow if what you want is not available."
,,Busy on the weekend,4.0,,"A great experience of a traditional food hall. It was extremely busy when we visited as it was a weekend lunch time. I wanted to try the famous hiannese chicken but the stall that is famous for beating Gordon Ramsay was sooooo long. I opted for the one next door which was a bit of a let down. Should have lined up with the 100 + locals and savoured the experience.
I would recommend going off peak and perhaps during the week.
Much better value than the prices just down the road in Chinatown $4 versus $18 for similar local food.
We go off the bus at China town and it is a 3 minute walk. It is well sign posted and the walk up the quaint streets adds to experience."
,,One Big Stop for Singapore Street Food,4.0,,"Hawker Centres/Food Courts are a unique aspect of Singapore culture and lifestyle. They provide good food at reasonable price for the general population, and for the tourists. Maxwell Food Court is one of the oldest and most popular food courts in Singapore, offering a huge variety of Singapore Street Food. This food court is so big that you need to go back many times in order to try all the excellent food. Here are a few of my favourite stalls: Zhen Zhen Porridge, Hainanese curry rice, Jin Hua Sliced Fish Bee Hoon, Xing Xing ondeh ondeh, Big Scissors curry rice, etc. There are many stalls selling fruit juices, beverages, etc. If you're a tourist, you must go and try the food there and enjoy a unique Singapore experience."
,,Real Singapore food,4.0,,"If you want to eat like singaporeans eat then you are perfectly right here.
Such an enormous choice of authentic food, I really love this hawker center.
All kind of the different Chinese food, nice people selling it, everybody being here should try it.
They also offer Tiger beer."
,,"Touristy, yes, but food is still good",5.0,,"We went there to try the roast duck and the oyster cake was a pleasant surprise. I wanted to order the char kway teow but the stall ran out of food halfway through the queue. We were not able to try the Tian Tian chicken rice because the line was too long and we just couldn't be bothered. But looking at what other people ordered there, just the food itself looked really good. I would come back if I get another chance."
,,Best Chicken Rice!,5.0,,"I went twice to to try the Chicken Rice war between the two top establishments Tian Tian and Ah-Tian- which is just right next to it. Both were excellent but Tian Tian is slightly better in my view.
I also tried the highly lauded fried bananas in a different place. Good but can be missed - not really worth going out of the way for this."
,,Great food experience,5.0,,Lots of hawkers that sell great Asian food. Just pick something you like and bring it to the tables between the hawkers. Friends can order from different stalls if they want. A very good craft beer bar is also inside!
,,Sunday lunch - super cheap lots of variety,4.0,,"Caught a taxi here for lunch after visiting the Singapore Flyer ($6 trip) be warned, not all the stalls were open as it was a Sunday - we got there early 11:30am so it wasn't overly busy. Lots of variety and super cheap ! A few vegetarian options, you can get a great meal for under $5. Beers also available. Scroll cake (peanut) for desert was delicious, I doubt you could get your choice too wrong - everything is fresh and cooked to order. A must for any tourist."
,,Truely Singapore,5.0,,"If you want to taste the local, this place is the place to be, as you can find soul and heart of every singaporean. You eat in the hot tropical heat with a bowl of spicy hot laksa, or a bowl of healthy fish slice soup with rice. Located there are many different types of food, of which many are top quality, and cheap"
,,Luscious!,4.0,,A pleasant place to visit! We‚Äôve actually visited here twice during our stay in Singapore. It truly worth $5 taxi fare from our hotel (Fullerton). We have tasted Zhen Zhen Porridge; Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice; Popiah @ Rojak Popiah & Cockle; King-Hwa sliced Fish Bee Hoon; Fu Jee Fu-Jo fish ball. All very delicious. Some people had to wait for 15-20 min during even non-busy hours. This place was almost always packed.
,,My favourite hawker centre!,5.0,,"Of the three we visited in Singapore, this one was my favourite. We had a simple but delicious chicken rice lunch, followed by two buns from the bakery cart. I wanted to go back for the doughnuts but the stand was closed. Highly recommended for a mid day meal!"
,,hawker centre experience,5.0,,the Singapore food scene is dominated by the foods stalls or hawker centres as popularly known. Maxwell centre hawker centre is a favourite and a must try for visitor to Singapore for under SGD 10 one can have a very nice meal
,,Sliced fish porridge,4.0,,Visited the Maxwell Market again this week for a dose of sliced fish porridge. Pretty crowded but after some persistence we were able to find some seats. The porridge was one of the better ones I've tried so far in Singapore.
,,Best place to sample all Singaporean dishes!,3.0,,"Located in the midst of the CBD, many office goers go to Maxwell for their daily lunch fix.
The dishes you can sample
1. Chicken Rice
2. Fish Soup
3. Char Kway Teow
4. Roasted Pork Rice
5. Duck Rice
6. Porridge
7. Peranakan food
8. Curry Rice
9. Indian/ Indonesian food

There are other options for salads, Western food, drink stalls a-plenty.

Around 30% of the stalls are shut due to the nearby construction, but you will never feel short of options.

Do carry a tissue packet to chop your seat!"
,,Deliciously Cheap,4.0,,"A delicious selection of Asian cuisines and fresh drink stalls. It opens early for breakfast, which was our favourite time to visit. Hearty plate of noodles, sausage and tofu or beans for less than AU$5 for two people! Great local atmosphere and friendly vendors. Easy walk from Chinatown and close to hotels such as The Club and Scarlett."
,,Enjoyed this experience alot!,4.0,,I was with people who didnt know what a Hawker's place was and I read somewhere that it's a must if you're visiting Singapore. It was fun for me. It was crowded but clean and organized! Food was awesome and clean!
,,Food court to the next level,4.0,,Make sure to try Tian Tian chicken here - the flavor is all in the hot sauce. Lots of great choices here.
,,Over-rated,3.0,,"We wanted to love our two visits here, but both times we were disappointed. Seems a bit dirty and past its prime."
,,Too easy!,4.0,,"I had Chicken Rice, a favourite dish of Singaporeans. It was delicious. The whole experience of 'booking' a seat at a table then eating with a group of unknown workers from nearby offices was very different, interesting and enjoyable. Highly recommended."
,,Very good,5.0,,Plenty of choices and a good atmosphere. food inexpensive and plenty of seating areas. It's good to see locals and tourists eating here
,,Street Food In Singapore,3.0,,"Well where to start This is as far removed from fancy as you can get But the maxwell Street Hawker food market is I am told the best among tourists
It is worth a visit The food is low cost and most dishes are very tasty.
Cleanliness is not high on the agenda but nothing that's not worth surviving can stand the heat it's cooked at
No jippy tums here folks
I always like to see locals eating the same food. Generally your eating authentic nosh
Considering Tiger beer is a Singapore Brew, it was pricey but dear lord needed for the szechuan chicken.
Go on you only live once"
,,One of the best cheap food court in Singapore,4.0,,"Went there Sunday evening (9PM) for food; most stalls were closed, but many were still opened. This is one of my favorite place to go for good inexpensive street-style food in Singapore (located in or near Chinatown, close to the Buddha tooth relic building). There are many stalls to chose from including dessert stalls (ice kachang feels great on a typical hot day in Singapore). My only knock against it is the limited vegan/vegetarian options."
,,Very good we loved it,5.0,,"We read good review abt Maxwell and tried our way from our airbnb home not far from this place. It was 0930 in the morning not so busy as I had expected as it was Saturday. Not all stalls are open yet but enough for us to see around and choose. We chose sea food char kwey tiaw, carrot cake, and oyster noodle from the middle stall. I also tried peanut soup (w rice glutinous ball) which the store owner told me is v famous till Japan. Excellent taste. In the afternoon we came back again and I tries the signature popiah. Very tasty - a bit spicy for me although I have ordered w medium spiciness level only. The sugar cane juice my husband got from stall next to popiah is also great. The highlight of the day is the mixed pork with rice. The roasted and barbecue pork are fatly sliced, fresh, and crispy. The owner also serve v generously. My daughter had pao with soy sauce pork and yam cake from the stall at the back. All are nice and cheap! Total less than 20 dollars!"
,,"Food, food everywhere and all of it to eat",4.0,,"Though there are other good hawker centres , Maxwell almost always draws me back to smell and taste the mind boggling array of eating and drinking (juice) options

Be it the world famous hainanese chicken rice , Tamizh Muslim biryani , sugar cane juice , cockles , porridge, Tim sum, bee hoon . This could be the best yet most inexpensive buffet in the world :)

Will be back"
,,Lunch,4.0,,"Almost everyday i am using my lunch in this food center is not because of it is nearer to my office. Evrnthough if my office is not inside cbd , I also take me lunch here. Here have my favourite food. Which was the curry rice. Not only curry rice. In this you'd centre there are more than 100 stall to choose from.especially when i tell u most of the stall here are famous in singapore. Some are do famous that I know this stall when I was in primary school. FYI I am now 44 years old."
,,Good Singapore local food,4.0,,"you can find many local Singapore food at this place , the place is very near china town by walking distance. suggest you try stall service by local ad the food will be good ."
,,Cheap and very nice local food,4.0,,"Maxwell Road Hawker Centre has many stalls that sell cheap and very yummy local food, the place is also easily accessible via the MRT or bus."
,,Best hawker centre around,4.0,,"This spot has some of the best Hainese chicken rice in town and not just Tian Tian's, but also Heng and others. There's really good Popiah form the middle store as well as satay and even a small craft beer joint! All the prices are reasonable, many more locals eat here, just be prepared to queue for chicken rice if you go on the weekend. The Bee Hoon fish soup is also excellent. Something for everyone, an authentic hawker experience!"
,,Good food and value can be found,4.0,,"I read other reviews and I don't get it. I went to Tian Tian for their famous chicken rice. This stall was made famous by Anthony Bourdain. I had the chicken rice, and it was good but nothing special. It was a simmered breast which was cooked well (not under or overdone) served on rice. there are a million variations on this in just about every culture. When I talked with locals, they said is their national comfort food. I went on a weekday at noon, and many of the stalls hadn't opened, and many offered the same dishes. What served me well was looking for stalls that do one thing, and then choose the one with the longest line. Language barrier can be an issue!

One stall I liked was a soup stall one row over from Tian Tian. It has ""Original soup"" in English on the sign. When I asked the owner what he recommended, he asked me how I was feeling. I actually was getting over a cold and he recommended soup with pork ribs. A few hours after eating that soup I felt noticeably better. A the soup was tasty!"
,,Best hawker centre around,5.0,,"First of all my wife loves Hianese chicken rice and theres a famous 1 there but after trying them all she rated Heng Heng Chicke rice up the end of the middle row of hawker centre was
absolute best of them. Theres alot of options to choose from and is open later in evening too compared to alot of hawker centres.

Great play to go and eat with the locals and try Heng Heng Chicken rice and you wont be disappointed.
Well worth going too."
,,Great food! Great value!,5.0,,"I have to visit here every time I visit Singapore. The Hainenese Chicken stalls and the roast Chinese meats are world class. And so cheap!!! Also, this gives you the true spirit of Chinatown."
,,Must not be missed when in Chinatown!,4.0,,"I stayed in Chinatown mainly to be near Maxwell Hawker and it was the best decision I made! This place is a must go, you have every Singapore signature dish you want to eat.

It's a really bit crowded though it may be hard to find seats so try going here on weekdays and a little bit earlier or later than lunch and dinner time.

Also, note that this place isn't airconditioned so be prepared. The food prices here are at least SGD 4 so your money can go a long way here.

Recently, I had my favorite steamed dumplings here and seafood soup and it was the best!"
,,Loved it,5.0,,Mix with the locals for some fabulous local cooking. Visited several times but my recommendation would be Nyonya which is stall 02 (I think) - a chance to sample Paranakan cuisine - rich and flavourful Chicken Rendang.
,,Top value local food,5.0,,Eat with locals and enjoy the local buzz. Excellent cheap and I mean cheap very good local food. Plenty of choice for most tastes.
,,Maxwell Road Hawker Centre,3.0,,"My wife & I recently visited Maxwell Rd Hawker Centre and while the food range is varied found better quality, range and prices at Chinatown Food Street & La Pau Sat 7"
,,"Big hawker center, less variety than Lau Pa Sat",4.0,,"We enjoyed our meal at Maxwell, but found the choices limited compared to Lau PA SAT. Still if you're around Chinatown, it's worth to have a meal here."
,,Delicious and cheap,4.0,,Hanoneise chicken is a must try. Can be a lengthy line up at some of the stalls. We visited a few days after Chinese New Year and several of the stalls were still closed.
,,"Great place, great food, reasonable prices",5.0,,A place which is very crowed at lunch time. This is a place where the Singapore people have lunch. Difficult to explain. So many food stalls with excellent food for a really good price. Just visit it and you know what I mean.
,,Amazing value food.,5.0,,"Enjoyed the experience eating here on the 1st day of Singapore visit so much that we returned once every day of our visit, either for lunch or early evening meal.
Good duck, seafood, chicken, noodle dishes etc and really enjoyed the juice bars.
My wife and I would both have a main course and juice each day for a combined cost of about 12-13 dollars each day.. Really enjoyed eating sometimes sharing tables with locals and other travellers."
,,local food,4.0,,great way to sample the local cuisine without a big hole in your pocketbook! Indiviual stalls selling all types a very typical Singaporean cuisine-chinese/malay/indian-it's all here
,,Daunting on your own first time,4.0,,I wish I'd read the reviews with their recommendations first! I walked round it twice before buying Chinese roast pork and a prawn fritter. I wish I'd bought the Laksa. I joined a table with some local office workers on their lunch break and had a great chat with them.
,,Place to visit when in Singapore,4.0,,"This was our second visit to Maxwell food center (the first one was four years ago). This well-located hawker stand has number of well-known, quality places. On our recent visit, we sampled:
1. Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken - Very long line, with mix of locals and tourists. Their Hainan style chicken rice is probably very good, but not something that I really enjoyed.
2. Maxwell Fuzhou Oyster Cake - These were good, definitely worth trying as a starter.
3. Fried Kway Teow - Very tasty noodles with seafood.
3. Lim Kee (Orchard) Banana Fritter - Delicious banana and tapioca fritters, now a second-generation business."
,,"Great food, great price!",4.0,,"We headed to the Maxwell Road Hawker Centre with one food in mind - Chicken Rice. This is best place to buy this dish, so make sure you give it a try.
We tried the famous Tian Tian Chicken rice stall.
Although there is plenty for everyone. We went later at night and it was not that busy."
,,Local hawkers,3.0,,"Maxwell is 1 of the more famous and central hawker centres, anchored by the Tian Tian chicken rice stall

The queue at Tian is incredible during peak meal hours, so i went at 2pm. It was good. The hawker centre was overall still bustling at 2pm

1 new find is the osyter cake stall 5 i think. New for me, but it has been around for decades. Like Tian, Anthony Boudain also like this, so it must be good"
,,"Cheap food, lots of choice and quick service",4.0,,"This was a great stop off for a late lunch. Peak times it's really busy, but off peak, we went twice and didn't struggle for a seat...take a packet of tissues, leave on the seat to reserve! There's some good and not so good food choices and it takes a good 20 mins to walk around and see what's on offer. Large bottle of Tiger beer are cheap."
,,Great place to eat just be confident!,5.0,,"Solo female traveller - found it a bit intimidating with all the locals not knowing which stall to go to. First time I went to the Japanese one and had chicken - was good. Then returned, each time becoming more confident - had traditional chicken one time and then duck. Be aware to order drinks at the specific counters, the food ones don't sell drinks. Also not a huge amount of tables so just sit down with someone that's what I did! Amazing atmosphere and cheap prices, sit with the locals and people watch! Good location I loved it!"
,,Just one of the average Hawker Centre,3.0,,"The food being served there is nothing special, so don't really have to go all the way there to eat if you have a nearby hawker centre"
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,We had less than 24 hours in Singapore & a friend living in the city told us this would be a great place for lunch. He was right. The line at Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice was very long but worth it. The whole family wished we had ordered two. Everything you want a chicken & rice dish to be. We also had some delicious dumplings from Special Shanghai Tim Sum (located near the main entrance). I watched the woman hand fill the dumpling before steaming them. They tasted like heaven. It was crowded but most people don't linger unless they are tourists ;) Lots of people cleaning tables & very chatty with tourists. I would eat here again.
,,Great selection,4.0,,A really wide variety of stalls offering lots of different choices. Inexpensive and truly good food. The atmosphere is busy and a little restless but otherwise a great place for lunch.
,,Burp!,5.0,,A fusion of Asian carte du jour! Cheap but yummy. Most meals are at S$4 and below. For those who are on a budget but picky on food.
,,Cheap eats,4.0,,"Lots of different variety food can be found here, from Chinese, Malaysian, Indian to western and Japanese, we tried the famous chicken rice roasted duck rice, fried oyster, fried koey teow and fresh young coconut, all were really yummy and cheap ,this is a really local hawker centre located near Chinatown ,worth a try !"
,,Never fails!,5.0,,"This place never fails for consistently good, cheap food. Love the duck items. Plate of duck, pork and noodle S$4. It's always busy when we go so it make take a while to find a seat if there are a few of you. Cold beer also available (large bottle S$7). Love the freshly squeezed sugar cane juice for S$1.50. Can't beat it!"
,,"Hot, crowded and over-hyped",2.0,,"Give this a miss. It is overly crowded, the stalls are a mixed bag. The good ones have ridiculously long queues and the mediocre ones are deserted."
,,"Cheap, tasty and a good vibe",4.0,,"Great spot in Chinatown that friends got us on to. Good authentic street food where if you can grab a table you can simply just relax with a few coldies and eat to you can't anymore on the many dishes surrounding you.

I love a spot where you go and the stall owner stops you to say you have given him too much and the dish was only $3!"
,,All the things for lunch!,4.0,,So much choice here. I came here for lunch and it took me over 20 mins to walk around and choose which vendor and which food I wanted. Settled on some Japanese fried chicken in the end which was delicious and filling.
,,A bit out of the way given the construction in the area,3.0,,Went there to seek out the 'famous' chicken rice - it was over rated. We went around 3 in the afternoon so between lunch and dinner many places were closed. There is a good variety of local street food
,,Very Interesting,4.0,,"We visited this center twice during our visit to Singapore. We enjoyed the local food. It is large, but quite crowded. Visitors must be patient in order to obtain a table"
,,Eat like a local,4.0,,So many people had told us to eat here and we were not disappointed with the food. Its quite a large place and we couldn't remember which places had been recommended so looked for the locals and went for the busiest stall that sold Chicken & Rice.
,,Excellent Hawker choice.,5.0,,Hundreds of vendors Find the longest line and order whatever the people in front of you order. Look for the deep fried bananas. Finding a table at lunchtime is near impossible. Worth the search. Elderly folks sell you a package of tissues for $1 which reserves a seat for you so you can look for food.
,,So fun and delicious food,5.0,,Came here this past January friends to check out the hawker food scene and it does not disappoint! There are tons of stands with different types of Asian cuisine and fruit juice stands and the area is very clean and easy to navigate (near chinatown) definitely worth it!
,,Bomb dot com !!!,5.0,,Awesome little hawker hall with some AMAZING food !!! Highly recommend we ate at a few places here over a couple of days and they were all awesome. There were 2 places you have to go one had the most amazing duck & crispy pork there was a massive line which is how you tell which one it is but so worth the wait . The other was a place where they do and made dumplings !!! Did I mention it's dirt cheap like ridiculously cheap 2 words DO IT
,,Largest dining area,5.0,,Maxwell Road Hawker Centre is a largest dining place near Chinatown in Singapore. Huge area with different local foods one can taste. Very cheap compared to other food courts in Singapore.
,,Fun and delectable,4.0,,"A must-see on every tourist's itinerary, this place didn't disappoint us at all. The food centre does possess a lot of character and we were slightly adventurous to relish a few dishes. The Mei Goreng was that delectable that my kids and spouse had most of it. I then ordered a Seafood Crispy Noodles, and of course Tiger beer as an excellent accompaniment helped us enjoy the food."
,,Everything your tastebuds want and more!,5.0,,One of the best Hawker Centre's in the city with just about every imaginable type of food possible. Enjoy the madness!
,,Hawker Centre with nostalgic food,5.0,,"This market is very busy during the day with office personnel from the nearby CBD area coming for their lunch. The Tian Tian Chicken rice, Ho Kee Porridge, Zhen Zhen Porridge, are just some of the popular stalls in this centre. Besides selling real meals, a lot of snacks can be also found here. For example the Maxwell Fuzhou Oyster Cake ‚Äì Stall 05, the traditional snack is still made the old way. There is also Hum Chee Peng ( Chinese Sweet doughnut fritter)at stall 28.
Of course, the food centre also sells alcoholic beer and now, they even have a craft beer stall which sells hand crafted beer from USA and other countries."
,,Great cheap eats.,4.0,,"This is one of the must visit locations in Singapore. Cheap rates from a range of local cuisines. They have the policy of putting a packet of napkins on a table or chair and no one will sit there. It implies the table or chair is reserved for someone who is away getting food. Just be wary of the toilets in the complex. My wife went in and came straight back out and did not eat any more. Bit nasty. If you are on a budget and want to sample the local food, go here."
,,Clean and friendly,4.0,,"Visited for a late dinner at around 9pm and there were plenty of stalls still open. I'm vegetarian and was able to find a couple of options. The stall owners were very friendly and welcoming, as well as the cleaning staff who took our plates from us once we'd finished and were constantly wiping down tables."
,,Good variety of delicious food!,5.0,,"Visited Maxwell food court second time in two years. Selected a lot of different style of food. I recommend to try Hainanese chicken rice, some halal dishes and fresh fruit juices."
,,Don't judge the stalls by whats hanging in the windows! Best Chicken Rice in town!,5.0,,"We visited Maxwell Hawker for a late lunch - and had some spectacular chicken and rice. I would not have normally ordered food from a place with chicken heads hanging in the window and no picture of the food being served - but I decided to go out on a limb while experiencing asian food and culture to try it! AMAZING! So flavorful, moist and tender"
,,Delicious Cheap Eats,5.0,,"One of the best Hawkers Centre in Singapore, even Gordon Ramsay had a Chicken Rice Challenge here. Some of the stalls are even open late night, good after clubbing. Food here are authentically local and very affordable."
,,Wide variety of local food selection,4.0,,"Home to various local cuisines, Maxwell Road Hawker is convenient place to go from ChinaTown MRT. It's unlike other hawker centre because it is cleaner and more spacious. There centre offers a wide range of local Malay, Chinese, and Indian food, from Halal to non-Halal and from main dish to drinks and desserts. For starters, try the local Chicken rice and Bandung for drinks. Try the one served by the long queue."
,,Delicious fresh food,5.0,,My partner and I came here and just could not decide what to eat. So much to choose from and so much nice smelling food. What we did go for was very tasty.
,,You need to be adventurous and also know a little what is happening,5.0,,"Like all hawker markets in Singapore, this is also an excellent place. Because it is in China Town it specializes in Chinese food but also you can find one or two from everything you can thing of from a Singapore eating house.

Been there 3-4 times and I have tried chicken rice from the famous Tian Tian and also Ah Tian ( 2 doors next door) they are both excellent, I even seem to think that the Ah Tian is slightly better due to serving it the traditional way ( with soup)

Maybe this one or another one close to your hotel but you should defiantly try a hawkers market when you are in Singapore.

They are clean, home made, delicious, and anything you can ask for is there. It gives you a great understanding of why Asians are slimmer ( small servings) and the houses are small ( you do not need a kitchen if you have an eating house next to you.

You can try Chincken Rice; Malaysian Noodles, Nasi Lemak"
,,What not to like?,5.0,,"Probably one of if not the best hawker centre in downtown Singapore. Prices are reasonable if not lower than other hawker centres. Lots of varieties including one vegetarian stall. One tiny negative point I have is the seats and table are not movable. I was in group of 7 and one person had to sit at different table. Overall, great centre, great location, a must visit when you come to Singapore."
,,Cheap Eat,3.0,,"People recommended me to come to this centre for the chicken rice. I queued up to get a plate of this famous Hainan chicken rice but found it to be good, but not the best.
Frankly the place is hot and not a good dining experience. I would prefer to go to the Ion centre B4 level and get a plate of this chicken rice and eat in comfort"
,,Oh What Fun!,4.0,,"Singapore is one place you can feel safe and enjoy the local flavors! Hawker food in Singapore is legendary and not to be missed. The Maxwell Center is covered and clean. Hawker Stalls line the sides and tables and chairs go down the middle. They are constantly being cleaned and debris discarded by the employees. One side of the center is almost exclusively the local favorite, Chicken and Rice. Not to be missed. Each stall has a proprietory recipe and you will have to decide which you like best. Try to go off hours as it is very crowded. The other side has more offerings. Don't miss the barbecued pork and duck."
,,Foodie paradise,5.0,,"Great place for trying a variety of local foods in Singapore. Numerous food stalls, each one specializing in one or two dishes. We tried Tian Tian Chicken Rice based on the recommendation of our hotel front desk staff, and were pleased. Fun place to spend an hour soaking up the local culture."
,,Great food!,5.0,,So much to choose from at very reasonable prices! Each person can have a different meal in the same place-no one has to have the same food as each other! Love hawker centres!!üòã
,,Excellent food court,5.0,,"We went for one reason and that was to eat Hainan Chicken, the food court was very busy, lots of Office Johnny's eat lunch here, can't blame them cause if I worked around here I'd eat here every day. The variety of food and beverages are excellent."
,,Fried Bananas!!,4.0,,"Cool place.. great Local eats.. chicken rice, juice drinks, japanese fried chicken.. and my fav Fried Bananas!"
,,Food Paradise,4.0,,"Numerous Ethnic restaurants. Food is good and very cheap. I tried Hainan Chicken and it was excellent. Several stalls selling deserts and fresh juices. A little caution, be ready to share table and bring your own napkins. If you forgot the napkin there are old ladies selling them for a few cents."
,,Terrific lunch,5.0,,"As always, a terrific lunch was had! I loved the chicken rice and my husband had the dumplings! Great fun. They have even added toilets! Great place!"
,,Tapioca cake,5.0,,"A must must to eat at Maxwell Hawker Centre.Be forewarned that they do run out fast , so be EARLY.By 1plus, at times, the super soft tapioca cakes would have been snapped up already.It happened twice to me. Highly recommend this lovely delicious cake ."
,,The Ultimate Singapore Local Food Experience,5.0,,"I went here for dinner with my family. It has heaps of hawker stalls and great beers can be bought at the beer stand near the road. This is not a posh food eatery but a loud place full of chinese families going about their business. Food is chinese, malayan, vietnamese and also thai so it covers all bases !! It is clean and service is fast. It offers heaps of different types of food outside of the standard fare so make the effort to walk around the stalls and see what is on offer. Very cheap and good quality. Highly recommended !"
,,Great intro to singapore street food.,4.0,,We ate here as we'd heard about the tian tisn chicken & rice stand here. As reviewed separately it was fabulous. But once here we felt obliged to try a few of the other stalls. No 71 had a great duck & rice dish with great tender duck meat. Two shops down from tian tian they had a good prawn & pork dumpling in noodle broth. There were stalls selling fresh coconuts & others with juices like lime & sour plum ( actually salty plums). We also tried rojak which was an interesting experiece in local fruit & chewy fried bean dessert covered in crushed nuts. There was a large thunderstorm at the same time and we stayed completely dry with all the locals. It was a great experience
,,Recommended by locals,4.0,,"The best way to determine if an eatery is good is to see if locals eat there, and you'll find lots of locals here. Considered to be more authentic than La Pau Sat which is though to be a tourist trap, Maxwell Market offers a wide range of cuisines for your palate. It's easily accesible, like most places in Singapore. It's about two minutes from Tanjong Pagar MRT or a 10 minute walk from China Town MRT."
,,Brilliant introduction to various Chinese cuisine,4.0,,"Do not expect posh eatery, here is the simple food stalls serving dishes from recipes liked by locals.Shelter but hot and sticky it is.Authentic local food at reasonable prices."
,,Street Food City,4.0,,"Maxwell Road Food Centre has one of the best collection of yummy street food in Singapore. I have tried the Tien Tien Chicken Rice, Teow Chew style pork porridge, deep fried dough fritters, fish broth noodle, etc. Its just a shory walk from Chinatown MRT station."
,,An excellent food court / hawker centre.,4.0,,"The food and the beer is cheap and good. Tian Tian chicken rice is very famous, and worth the queue, but if you don't feel like queuing all the chicken rice stalls are good - and they all have blue signs, so if you do want Tian Tian check the english lettering :-) As well, there's a couple of stalls that have really good oyster or prawn omelettes, otherwise noodles, char kway teow, etc., etc. - but no satay ..."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"What a lovely little ""food court"" with the locals. Chicken rice dish was yum but the egg tarts were amazing. Crazy cheap. Oh and try the fresh coconut drink yummmm"
,,maxwell road hawker centre-The best hawker centre in singapore,5.0,,"I visited maxwell hawker centre almost every fornight and the stalls which stood out as one of Singapore best or the best indeed are many. I just highlight a few here, the first is the tian tian lye chicken rice stall which ranks amount the top 3 chicken rice in Singapore in my opinion. (They are comparable to Singapore BEST in this category as the chatterbox of mandarin orchard and POW SING restaurant in serangoon garden, opposite chomp chomp). Their steamed white chicken is so succulent and soft that it could melt in your mouth and the rice itself is so delicious that you could even eat it alone without anything else. The chili and dark soy sauce that come with the chicken rice is so nice that you can never have enough of it. However, the queue could be rather long and usually took about 30 mins in peak hours. The other notable stall is the LIM KEE GORENG pi-sang or banana fritters stall. This so crispy and deliciously sweet and come in generous portion . You can take it as a meal as you could eat one after another without any restraints. The Teochew porridge or AH HENG Porridge comes with very fresh ingredient such as steamed fishes and fishball and other vegetable dishes. Very reasonable prices and tasty indeed. The curry puffs and sardine puffs stall is equally good and so are the drink and fruit juice stalls which also sell fresh coconuts and healthy fruits juice are good value for money. Likewise the thai food stall at the corner looks very appetizing even though I have yet to patronize it . The Chinese restaurant at the other corner sell currey fish head and claypot fog legs looks delicious and prices are reasonable as advertised. All in all, Maxwell hawker market offers a wide variety of good and delicious hawker fares which are reasonable in prices and really value for money stuffs. You should be there whenever there is an opportunity. Don't missed it if you are travelling to Singapore."
,,Great Food with heaps of choice,5.0,,"So much to choose from! How to decide! A great, clean hawker centre with heaps of food choice. Close to Chinatown. Currently have construction out the front, but centre is still open."
,,Chicken Rice yam yam,4.0,,Yummie Chicken Rice...delicious streetfood!!!...i really like...self service..good price..good foood...good people...Done!
,,Great local food,4.0,,Great local food. Very cheap & lots of choice. I love the tian tian chicken & rice. I visit here every time I am in Singapore
,,A huge food complex,4.0,,A very busy hawker food area with more than 80 various outlets. Open till about 10PM but we went for lunch and it was very busy and a long wait for your food of choice and a table near what you choose. Excellent food and prices are fair.
,,Choices,5.0,,"If you are with a party of different opinions, bring them here while you are in Chinatown. There are more than enough choices to satisfy everyone's cravings. All the good food under one roof. Pick something here and there and you will have a full meal, including desserts and drinks."
,,Foodlovers paradise,5.0,,"I loved this place! I have had amazing chicken rice (forgot the name of the place, but there was a long line with locals so i guess it is famous) and enjoyed sitting by myself, getting a glimpse of local life."
,,Excellent and good local food can be found here at reasonable prices!,5.0,,"Firstly, this isn't a restaurant but a hawker center. This is an excellent place for local delights that any tourist can come by and savor the taste and smell of Singapore food. A place not to be missed or unchecked on your To Do list."
,,My fav hawker food in singapore!,5.0,,"Loved the atmosphere here...tourists n locals all looking for the good food in every lane in this hawker center.

Personal favs are:
1) Tian Tian chicken rice - do q! It's worth the wait. The rice, chicken, chillie are all too rate. In other stalls, you'll get one of the above good, but at this stall, u get the best of all these elements!

2) china street curry rice - messy curry dripping over the edge of your selection of pork chops, cabbage and char Siew...but so yummy. If u like more spiciness, add their chillie.

3) Tong Xin Ju dumplings and hot/sour soup. Value for $. Especially the hot sour soup, $3 is good for 2 pax. The dumplings are smooth and have tasty fillings.

So many more yummies...quick go look for the stalls with q!"
,,"Freshly made, very tasty AND very inexpensive!",5.0,,"During our short stay, we stopped by Hawker Centre to check it out. We were told by the Uber drive that the first stall by the entrance is where the Singpore's PM often frequents for some Fried Kway Teow. There was a line even at 2PM. So we waited about 10 mins and concluded, yes, this was definitely good, especially for SGD $5! Then we decided to try couple other places in the Centre. The stall across made fresh dumplings and wontons. We order some spicy wontons - seriously, they made it fresh for each order and they were THE BEST wontons I've ever had. Frankly, compared to all dumplings, probably one of the best I've ever had! And these are not the typical wontons you get in wontons soups at Chinese restaurants in U.S. These were fat and perfectly cooked wontons! I literally want to go back on our return layover this weekend for them! Then my husband ordered some duck and he was also blown away by how tender and good the duck meat was! They were all SGD $5 each!!! This place is amazing! We need something like this in San Francisco!!!"
,,"Brilliant Place to Eat, Drink and be Merry",5.0,,"What a great find. After being told about this Hawker Centre by the wonderful reception staff at our hotel we gave it a try and were not disappointed. Wonderful food, unbelievable valve and nice cold beers."
,,Cheap eats!,5.0,,"It's a must go if you are looking for variety and on a budget. It's a 5-10 minute walk from Pagoda street in Chinatown. There were more than 30 stalls in there but many serving the same entrees. I suggest looking for the long queues to know which stand is good. We had the bak kut teh, Hainese chicken and the Singapore noodle. Everything was about 3-6$ Singapore dollars."
,,So many great places!,4.0,,"Our tour guide took us here - one of his favorites! We ate ""chicken rice"" from world famous Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice, where lines can be over one hour long at lunch. The hawker experience must not be missed."
,,Very unique,4.0,,"The atmosphere was hot and sticky and so was my food. There was a wide variety of stalls to choose from. Cleanliness was average, but the facilities were well organised Would go there again."
,,Variety of Chinese food,4.0,,"I can recommend the food market - we had dumplings, pork and noodles for 4.50$ which was an acceptable price for the amount of food! Additionally we had a mango smoothie. We really liked the atmosphere and the food there and would go back."
,,Succulent chicken rice,5.0,,"Maxwell Hawker center is located close to Chinatown. Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken rice is a must, but prepare for the Long wait... Anyways worth the wait. One of the most succulent chicken I have ever had!"
,,Food,5.0,,The hawker centre was just outside the so Sofitel such a great place to eat everything you could want to eat and more. Seems the place to go for everyone to enjoy. No unhappy people. The road is closed every night so satay sticks on the go every where. So tasty great place to meet.
,,Power Hawkers,3.0,,"Over here where you can find some if the most powerful hawkers in the area. From Fried Kuat Teow to chicken rice, to pratas... remember to get your Sugar Cane with Lime drink! Sure to bring the heat down."
,,Clean and spacious,4.0,,The food court is clean and spacious. Separated tray and cutlery for halal /non halal food. Many of food choices including nasi padang. Reasonable price.
,,tasty cheap food,5.0,,plenty of singaporean and other asian dishes at really cheap prices. if there's a line then it's generally worth waiting for. if you're vegetarian it's a little harder as even if it's vegetables it may be cooked in oyster sauce or pork lard. make sure to have cash as they are small stalls and don't take card.
,,lunch with close friends,4.0,,"I came here to eat fot lunch! Great to try the carrot cake or/and the hainanese chicken... around lunchtime it can get really busy , so try to avoid the busy hours."
,,Cheap local delights,4.0,,"Opposite the tooth relic temple we visited here for a quick bite. Nothing quick about it though as there was so much to choose from! A meal will set you back only $3-5, with blended ice drinks about $3.

There are local dishes (dried carrot cake, Peranakin dishes etc), as well as other Asian cuisines.

For the money, I'd recommend it. Plenty of locals also come here, we were amongst the handful of westerners eating there."
,,Great little find,4.0,,"Great place to eat any time of day, night or early hours of the morning... can get very busy peak hours (meal times) great veriety of Asia food from all over the region plus some western fast food thrown in for those not so adventurous.. food is good quality local, great tastes.. a must place to check out if visiting or just here for a few days on business.. it's under cover so no problems if it's rainnng"
,,Perfect way to sample local food,4.0,,"A bustling & clean hawker centre with a huge range of local food to choose from.
Grab a seat as soon as you can find one & take it in turns to go & explore the food options - or leave a packet of tissues or hat on the seat to indicate it's being used.
The stalls with the longest queues are the local favorites and worth the wait."
,,great place to go if you don't want to be bothered all the time,3.0,,Good honest food for a fraction of the price you'd pay in a restaurant. Singapore has as many food courts as much people from different backgrounds live there but i found this one particulary european friendly. p.s. don't fall for the carrot cake... :)
,,Cheap Food,4.0,,I came here to eat for lunch. They have delicious hainanese chicken rice in this hawker centre. All the food and drinks in this hawker centre is cheap. So it's a good place to eat and drink.
,,Maxwell Food centre,4.0,,"The Maxwell Food Centre provides a wide variety of Asian food and refreshments at an affordable price. It is a hawker centre. Food is purchased at stalls and eaten at common tables. The food is great, but the serving portions can be small. The tables and eating areas are clean and well maintained. The toilet facilities are typical of public toilets in Asia. Smoking is not allowed. Beer and soft drinks can be purchased."
,,Best Food Hawker Center,5.0,,"It might not be the biggest, but it has all the essential stands with quality street food and amazing prices: Tian Tian Chicken, crispy duck, soybean pudding, and fruit juices galore."
,,Easy yummy food,4.0,,"Had a chicken rice..yummy than the other famous one, chicken was juicy and the sauce was fabulous. Price was cheap compare to Singapore standard but quite limited space in this food court."
,,One of my favourite places,5.0,,Sadly we haven't been back to Singapore since 2014 but this is one of my favourite places. We thought we'd check it out partly out of curiousity as we'd heard about Anthony Bourdain's review of one of the stalls there. But the whole place was awesome. We ate from as many stalls as we could til we couldn't fit any more food in. And the fried tapioka was a perfect sweet way to finish off our very long lunch there.
,,Another good food hall,4.0,,"This food hall is similar to others in that it is a large area of food outlets with tables all around to sit at. Choose any outlet and sit where you want. No hawkers pushing you to their place! Cheap food and drinks in a reasonable location not far from Chinatown.

Check out the Ann Siang Hill area just down from the food hall after eating. It is a nice area of restored shop houses and buildings."
,,Dinner with close friends,5.0,,"Very good choice of food & specialities but choosing the food stalls that u are planning to get bcoz a friend of mine chose a Oyster Omelette store owned by.a mainland Chinese & his helper or wife, (I ain't a racist person) but Oyster Omelette,either cooked by Singaporean or Malaysian,both are good chefs but don't goes with those Chinese cooks bcoz it's not their specialities in Asian Singaporean & Malaysian....so never make a wrong choice in choosing the food & stall,depending on their specialities with their own countries' specialities!"
,,Food and drink to the hearts desire.,4.0,,"Probably one of Singapores more famous food courts or Hawkers as they are locally called, the Maxwell Road Hawker Court is a delightful food court offering a wide range of choices from many little shops. With plenty of drink choices from fresh fruit to soft drink available. All at very affordable prices. Hainan chicken is probably one of the specialities here. A real mix of colour and aroma to visit."
,,Try anything,5.0,,We rutted a few different places. Loved the fried fish dumplings hi fun at ah liang Such a wonderful clean broth. Very tasty
,,$2 noodle soup,4.0,,"theres this shop which sells a $2 noodle soup, delicous and cheap, we were there after 2am when we just finish bar hopping, the uncle was so cute coz he dont speak english and yet theres a long cue at his shop"
,,"Wow, lots to choose from",4.0,,"This is fast food Singapore style. I tried 2 hawker sites and this one, near Chinatown seems more authentic. There are small door stalls selling very reasonable priced foods of various types. You buy Chicken rice from one censer and then buy your drink from another. There are large tables to sit, with a roof over the whole area. Very informal eating at a very reasonable cost, as formal restaurants might cost $50-100 SG whereas the hawker stands might be $5-6SG per plate."
,,Our favorite eating spot.,5.0,,"Luckily for us we were walking distance from here which allowed to have a lot of visits. We also were taken here on a food tour took with Singapore City Explorers.
You CANT have too many visits here if you love food. There is even a craft brewery stall where you but several very good beers from around the world.
We loved the Hainanese Chicken rice from Tian Tian and the roast pork (2 styles both great) and the roast duck from a stall in the middle row on the right hand side when you are facing in the direction of Singapore City Gallery (with the construction site for the new Maxwell MRT behind you). There is usually queue but the search and the wait is worth. I am having withdrawls writing this.
Be brave try as much as you can."
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,"This hawker center is great! Great to try the carrot cake or/and the hainanese chicken...or anything you feel like...Around lunchtime it can get really busy, so try to avoid the busy hours or just plan extra time and mingle with the crowd."
,,Amazing food taste and quality for price.,5.0,,Great local eating spot with a wide variety of local selections. Some local area construction makes it seem closed but go beyond and experience the delights. Everything I ate there was well portioned and very tasty.
,,Real Singapore,4.0,,One of the great treats of Asia is the Hawker Centre. Singapore's are among the very best. Maxwell Road is an excellent example. Dozens of food stalls serve everything from Chicken Rice to Sattay and Tiger beer to fresh squeezed fruit juices. Don't miss the Hawker Centre experience.
,,Fantastic lunch,5.0,,"Fun visit with first time Singapore visitors to a hawker center, great selections to pick from and both cheap and tasty too."
,,Yummy and reliable.,4.0,,"Some great, long-standing vendors are here and their food is consistently delicious.
Tian-Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice is outstanding as are the fresh daily kueh from the elderly couple.
I am scared that the kueh making tradition and expertise will die out with their generation; so enjoy while you can.

Also fantastic is the roti prata and the fish ball noodle stalls.

Not all stalls are open at the same time, so you need to time your visit or just be happy with what's available.

We came for breakfast, brunch and lunch and afternoon tea - and were able to eat all our favourites.

The food is well priced and the environment is typical of a Hawker Centre. Being Singapore the hawker stalls are regularly inspected for hygiene standards and the shops display their certificates for all to see.

Maxwell Centre is"
,,Good cheap local food,4.0,,"No frills but most of the locals eat here. Watch them cook it up in front of you. Not the most gorgeous looking place but it's popular and is the oldest hawker centre in Singapore so when in Singapore eat like a local with a local.
Very cheap- get a filing good meal for $5!"
,,Excellent food,5.0,,"Tried a few different food stores, great varieties. My favorite was Tian tian hainanese chicken rice. Best chicken ever. Very reasonable price. Fried banana from Liam Kee was very yummy too."
,,Various Food,4.0,,It's a very nice places that you can enjoy a lot of dishes and many kinds of food to choose with cheapest price.
,,Cheap and yummy,4.0,,"If you're tight on budget, this is the perfect place to eat. There are a lot of options and you can have a full meal for as low as 3 SGD. It's also surprisingly clean."
,,Delicious street food!,4.0,,"Wonderful assortment of cheap local eats served in Chinatown. On a Sunday, it had fewer open shops than expected but there was plenty to choose from. Try to do a little research before going so you can be familiar with the names of the dishes. Then carry your list with you. Try to look for the longest lines that are essentially telling you that these are the best stalls. Don't miss the fresh fruit and soy based drinks. Enjoy."
,,Various food,5.0,,One of the best food center has a lot of various menu with reasonable price. Soon there will be a MRT Stop near this place.
,,Standard hawker lunch,3.0,,Nothing special but cheap good value and clean. Beer nice and cold. The chicken rice mix was just that and the chilli sauce very hit
,,Authenticity Galore!,4.0,,"All the must taste Singaporean dishes are here.
I've had the popular Hainanese Chicken here courtesy of a very friendly Auntie and her husband.
I also had a variety of rice cakes from an Indonesian immigrant who made his life better by selling at Maxwell.
Don't get fooled by the hawker name, the place, like any in Singapore is clean and orderly."
,,Yummy,4.0,,"I went during off peak hours of about 3pm. The area it is in is Chinatown. There is a lot of construction going on around the area, but I was still able to navigate it from the Chinatown MRT. Lots of food to choose from. The seafood noodle soup was good, spicy, and fresh. The sugar cane juice was refreshing on a hot humid day."
,,Tasty lunch,4.0,,Famous for best chicken rice but expect to queue. Tried the kway teow which is tasty but a little sweet.
,,Interesing experience,4.0,,"Of course, it's way more fun to go here in a group but I was alone. You can see a great mix of local people and tourists here. I ended up sitting at one of the round tables with the guy who had made my lunch. I guess they deserve their lunch break, as well!
The place has a wide variety of different dishes available and if you play your cards right, you'll eat someting delicious for not much money, at all. If you are unsure and a bit lost, just look for the longest queues! They are a pretty good guide. :-)
Don't forget about the freshly made fruit juices, either!
Yum!!"
,,Chicken and Rice,5.0,,Visted twice while we were in town. Cheap and pretty tasty. I had the highly recommend chicken and rice. Was basic but tasty none the less. Pretty tourist friendly.
,,"Amazing food court, great prices and choice",5.0,,"Some real good eats here and only a hundred metres or so from the chinatown tourist rip-offs. Hainan chicken and standard Chinese plus a few Malay choices, plus some great drink choices and cheap beer. Maybe about fifty places to choose from in total."
,,Hustle and bustle with the locals,4.0,,"Great food, prices and atmosphere. You know it's good when it's mainly locals eating there. Please try!!"
,,Not to be mssed,4.0,,"If you enjoy down to earth delicious food cooked o perfection with no frills then this is a great place. We have had two restaurant meals, both very expensive and bland, two curries here were just amazing, plentiful and delicious. Sure there was no air conor fsncy waiters but I came for the food not the service or rip off prices, each curry was eight dollars and a beer seven and just outstanding."
,,Heaven on Earth,5.0,,"This is my favorite place on earth, any time of day. Roast duck and char siew noodles, white/black carrot cake, kopi, shakes, tea, chicken rice... pretty much anything you can imagine is here. This is my first and last stop every time I pass through Singapore. It is not classy, but it's clean and awesome."
,,"Choices, choices",5.0,,"Huge range of food options to choose from. Two challenges here, first is making a decision on what you want to eat and the second is finding a spare seat. Second can be made easier by not visiting when office lunch breaks commence."
,,Beautiful Place - Maxwell Road Hawker Centre in Singapore,5.0,,It's a well known food centre for tasty and huge variety of local Hawker food in Singapore and it's very famous for Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice which most people say that it's the fragrant and tasty Rice that makes them to come back for more really it's awesome one must visit this place during their visit to Singapore.
,,Is a place for local food,3.0,,the taste of the local food in Maxwell Road Hawker centre is quik Ok. price also reseable compare withmost of the most of the place for the local food (taste not nice at all)
,,Affordable and good!,4.0,,The first time I ate there I had the porridge which was highly recommended by friends and true enough it was one of the best tasting porridge I have tried. I simply love their tofu dish as well. What I really like about Maxwell is the variety of food options. It is so hard to decided what to eat simply because everything I tried tasted good for the price you pay and considered really affordable. So definitely a must visit for anyone after your Chinatown visit.
,,Worth getting around the massive new station construction to visit,5.0,,"Worth getting around the massive new station construction to visit, if you want the real taste experience of China Town, Singapore. Long lines of people waiting outside some of the venders, most have pictures of the menu to help you choose (or avoid if you do not fancy gizards etc etc). Very good freshly cooked food, plenty of tables to share, most venders provide chop sticks, few forks and spoons, purchase bottled drinks from other venders.
Take your own hand sanitiser and napkins; all venders are regularly inspected by health authorities.
Just brilliant taste experience."
,,Good eats and reasonable,5.0,,"Do not need to break your bank to try local flair. Good selection of food, can't try all at one go. Have your breakfast - try the choke (porridge, congee as some may call it). For $3.00, should last you till your lunch break. The stir fried taro cake/noodle soup is yummy, have it for lunch. Some seafood, satay and oyster egg - reasonable. Go for the one with a line, maybe a little wait but it is well worth it. Don't forget to have some freshly squeezed fruit juices or the coconut water."
,,Completely authentic food,5.0,,"You can just tell by looking at the other folk that this is a place frequented by many many locals. You get local (non tourist) prices so incredibly cheap, many main courses were only S$5 each. A lot of competition between the stalls. We followed the crowd and if most of the locals were lining up at a particular stall for a certain dish then that is a sure sign of where to eat. In this case chicken rice at Tian Tian's yummy although I prefer spicy food, but when in rome...."
,,great food choices cheap fresh juices,5.0,,great variety of good and drinks good affordable prices. lined up for about 20ins for poplular chicken rice. chicken was nice average but rice itself was delicious. the centre is undercover but not airconditioned though so be prepared to sweat while you eat.
,,Best Cheap Eats in a City With Costly Food,4.0,,"TianTian chicken rice gets all the hype and has the long lines, but there are many other (read: better) choices within this complex. Ambiance is poor, it will be a construction zone until 2021 when the MRT station being built there finally opens, but the great value grub remains unchanged."
,,So many choices!!!,5.0,,"Great and cheap food. No nonsense, food hall style eatery with so many choices you'll have a hard time deciding what to eat. The place is full of character, fool of locals enjoying great food and wonderfull smells of fresh herbs and spices. Guess what? There is an outlet there with a Michelin Star to it's name! You'll have no problem finding which one!"
,,Decent food at a relatively low price,4.0,,"Singapore street food isn't cheap when compared to the rest of Asia, so don't expect things to be dirt cheap.
Having said that, the street food is likely to be safer eating than most of Asia.
The Hawker centre has quite a few stalls, although at the time we visited, past 8:00 pm on a Sunday night, most were closed. The famous chicken rice stall was still open, so we had that, as well as the poh piah from one of the other stalls close by.
The poh piah was very good. The dark chicken rice was good, the white chicken rice I felt was less so.
Overall decent food for just over SG$10."
,,Cheap local fare,4.0,,Used this food court for breakfast while staying at the Scarlett hotel.just around the corner . large array of local food and cheap prices. Most importantly clean.
,,Maxwell Fuzhou Oyster Cake,5.0,,"What a little parcel of muchie heaven. A deep fried parcel of mince pork, peanut, prawn, celery leaf and oyster. Wonderful. Maxwell Fuzhou Oyster cakes have been producing theses tasty morsels for 45 years."
,,Fun place for tourists,4.0,,"This place is just jam packed with food stalls of great variety. There are obviously going to be establishments selling the same types of food. Look for the ones where you see the locals waiting in line. I walked through the whole place and found one place that sold only Hainan chicken and there was a line, although it moved very quickly. The food did not disappoint at all, probably the best Hainan chicken I have ever had and for the price, it could not be beat. The fruit juice stands are also very plentiful. There's a reason the locals eat here."
,,Dinner stop,3.0,,"Great place to go with a big variety of different stalls for your meals.
Cheap meals and this is where the Tian Tian Hainan Chicken store is located made famous by Anthony Bourdain.
Loved the sugar cane drink that was sold at the fresh fruit juice stall.
Make sure you try and get seating around a fan otherwise it gets very warm inside."
,,Excellent,5.0,,Authentic hawker street food at reasonable prices. Good atmosphere and long queues at the best stalls! Well worth a visit. Each stall tends to close as they sell out so don't leave it too late. Go before 630pm.
,,Great,4.0,,"Super food at super cheap prices but do not expect comfort or even clean tables.
As a food court you are spoilt for choice food wise. The prices are cheaper with your bottle of tiger costing more then a main course.
The place is always full but these days mostly tourist but also a significant number of locals."
,,Lots of good local food stalls at Maxwell Food Centre,4.0,,"There are lots of good local food stalls to try, here's to name a few:

1. Chicken rice - Tian tian is the famous stall with a snaking long queue but if queuing is not your style then head a few stalls away to another chicken rice stall which is just as good.

2. Hainanese curry rice - The difference between hainanese curry and indian or malay curry is hainanese curry is less spicy, of a thicker consistency and possibly a little sweeter than its counterparts. I would reccommend the pork chop, chap chye mixed cabbage vegetables and a sunny egg for a complete hainanese curry rice deal!

3. Octopus Ball noodles - One of the few stalls left that does handmade octopus stall in Singapore. The other that I know of is in Hock Hai food centre but the very narrow hours at that stall makes it hard to catch the stall in operation. This is a good alternative. Have it with noodles in soup or dry with a chilli vinegar sauce!

4. Peanut Mochi Balls in sweet peanutty soup (Ar Bor Ling) - A traditional dessert that delivers the oomph of crushed peanut straight to your senses!"
,,ANYTHING YOU LIKE,5.0,,"Maxwell Road Hawker Centre is located in a very nice area of Singapore. Nice old style buildings and plenty of greenery to see. After your stroll juts get to the Hawker Centre and roam around before you make your choice!
You can find anything, from one of the best Chicken Rice in Singapore to fantastic dumplings (freshly prepared of course!) and fantastic BBQ Stingray! If you don't like Asian food (i pity you!) there are some stalls selling Western stuff too... but really you should try something Asian! There is the typical coffee, fresh juice and beer available to go along with your food. Also important, the prices are extremely fair!

If you have had too much to eat, just go for a walk again!"
,,Crowded but so good,4.0,,"Yes yes, Tian Tian chicken rice is so much raved about but there are really so many good places to choose from here. As usual, go where the locals go and you won't go wrong. Be sure to try Lao Ban chilled soya bean!!!"
,,Singapore Laksa yummmy,5.0,,"A great and famous Hawker centre for outstanding food. The Laksa was delicious, and lime juice refreshing. The building itself is old and beautiful. A must do in a city of must do's"
,,crowded but delicious food,4.0,,"very crowded during the week days. the food is very affordable and yummy.

love the chicken rice, fried ball with vegetable, vegetarian meals. A excellent location for all 3 meals a day (Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner) and some say supper!

Other than that, there is a range of food from Chinese, Western, Seafood, Thai, Indian and many more.

The only thing is it is difficult to spot it on the main road as they are doing road correction now."
,,Handy Cheap Eats in an interesting area,4.0,,"Maxwell Food Centre is not only a great Hawker Centre, it is in a really interesting area to explore. I use it as a resting point and refuelling spot when visiting the various galleries, bookshops, and admiring the local traditional shop house architecture.
It is a clean and open centre with plenty of seating and loads of different cuisines to choose from. The roti stall at the far end does very good trade. As in all Hawker Centres - look for the long queues to pick the best food.
Plenty of drink stalls too if you just want a coffee, cold drink, beer etc."
,,Great value,4.0,,Authentic and fantastic priced food - you have to go past there if you fancy to save a dollar or two but still fancy to eat decently.
,,Delicious Late Saturday Lunch,4.0,,"The carpark next to it was closed for DTL3 MRT construction. Park at opposite URA building. Order the fish bee hoon with milk which one of my favourite when visit here. Same taste, same aroma. The fish still the same fresh. Take a sit at the table facing the main road, order the ngo hiong with fried bee hoon. I order the eggs cake, fish and shrimp ngo hiong, also the standard pork and liver ngo hiong, plus a century eggs. Still the same standard, probably one of the best ngo hiong in the island. What a full filling late lunch for two person."
,,Great local food concentrated in one place,4.0,,"Brought the family for a good meal and we love the place. We had award winning chicken rice, fish ball noodles. Place is clean and ample place to sit. Well ventilated with many ceiling fans.

Many other food like fried oyster, pancakes, duck rice, fish porridge, Mee goreng, Mee rebus, satay, Nasi lemak, lontong, Hainanese curry rice, economy rice and so much more

Highly recommended Abd happy eating"
,,Delicious and cheap,4.0,,"The food is delicious and cheap! The Centre has plenty of food options (Thai Indian, Chinese and more). It isclose to Chinatown and very easy to find!"
,,Maxwell Market,4.0,,"Chicken rice, anyone? Go grab a plate at Maxwell market. There are many choices there and many are of a reasonable standard. The very famous Tian Tian chicken rice store has its flagship store there and you can see a constant queue for their chicken rice. Well, they did beat a very famous chef for that dish in a competition.....

The market has diverse choices and provide you a variety of choices. Prices remain reasonable. So its definitely worth a visit."
,,Local Food Hall,4.0,,If you are looking for a locals food hall experience this is the place. Because it is a roof over with no enclosed walls it is fresh and inviting looking in comparison to quite a few others we have been to. Food in most of the stalls look fresh because of the high turnover from the locals. It is within walking distance of the back side of China Town so is easy to find.
,,Great food,5.0,,Lots of options and the food is great. The duck noodles were amazing and so was the satay roll. Great food.
,,Lovely ducks üòä,5.0,,I really don't eat ducks but Singapore push me to eat some and it was awesome. The flavor is just really perfect and sweet. I can eat it every single day. Here in maxwell hawker centre you can have everything you're craving for. Name it and they have it for sure! And another good thing it's walking distance to Buddha tooth relic temple and chinatown. So after a tiring walk you can go and have some yummy but cheap meals here. Another thing the place was so clean.
,,Fun place to eat,4.0,,"This was a really fun (and cheap) place to have a meal in Singapore.

Tian tian Hainanese chicken rice was delicious, as was the carrot cake from the stall opposite.
Plenty of choice for good meals. Not many options for vegetarians though...

Easy to reach via the MRT."
,,Fair,3.0,,"Fair place to have food especially Chicken rice. The price is fair. The taste, for me is not really good."
,,Delicious eats at cheap prices,5.0,,"Everyone can find something to satiate their food cravings here. Chinese, Thai, Malaysian, Indian. You name it and they have it. Consisting of food stalls and tables and chairs to sit and enjoy your selections. We tried the chicken rice which is so highly touted and the fish head soup. Both delicious and deep in flavor for just a few bucks. Be prepared to share tables since space is limited and bring your own napkins or tissue since the vendors do not provide any. Great area to try a lot of different local dishes for not a lot of money."
,,Good value for Singapore,4.0,,"We came here today (Saturday) for lunch, around 12:30pm. The place was pretty busy but we managed to find seats without trouble (sometimes sharing tables), although I would say around half the stalls were closed - not sure why!

The chicken rice (I forget the name of the stall, but it had a queue about 20 people long) was very good. It comes in a tasty gravy. A medium portion was 5 SGD, and a small was 3.50 SGD.

We also tried some other stalls and enjoyed the 'carrot cake' - which has no carrot in it at all as far as I can tell, but is a form of rice flour and water which is solidified and cooked with egg in a sauce.

There aren't many choices for vegetarians unfortunately, but there are a few and one place does a tofu clay pot. Green veg cooked in oyster sauce is also available - and tasty! There are drink stalls, some places serving beer, and a few dessert stalls too (such as a kind of filled pancake or banana fritters). You can try food from numerous stalls and eat it at the tables.

The place is pretty clean, with many cleaning staff around, and it is under cover but we didn't find it too hot because of all the ceiling fans. Worth a visit if you fancy some cheap eats!"
,,Outstanding! Clean and easy to get to!,5.0,,"The food is great! Cheap! And the Centre has plenty of options. Close to Chinatown, very easy to find. We would have eaten here again if we had the time."
,,Quiet place to eat on a Sunday,4.0,,"I went for lunch on a Sunday, and it was pretty quiet, probably because only half the stalls were open.

I started with Chicken Rice from Tian Tian. Very tasty and only a 5 minute wait.

Next was dumplings from Special Shanghai Tim-Sum. Also very tasty and served very quickly, no queue here.

Finished with a deep fried banana fritter from Kim Lee (Orchard) Banana Fritters. This was absolutely delicious, probably a biased view because I love banana fritters anyway, but this was really good.

Prices were good value."
,,Great authentic food,5.0,,"We visited Maxwell Food Centre after reading the reviews on trip advisor and were not dissapointed. It was great food with plenty of choices. We ordered chicken and rice and Laksa both were delicious. It was our last day in Singapore otherwise we'd have eaten there again.
It was a little tricky to find due to the current building works but you will not be dissapointed. We caught the tube to Chinatown and it was only a five minute walk."
,,Plenty of stalls to choose from,4.0,,This food center has plenty of stalls to purchase food from and is well maintained. Go here for lunch or around 5 pm-ish to catch most of the hawker stalls open.
,,Went for the chicken and enjoyed more,4.0,,"Even after alighting Chinatown MRT, walking past Pagoda or Temple streets, everyone knows how to direct tourists to Maxwell Food Center. Its easily navigatable - even with the construction at the corner. There is always a bee-line of tourists making their way to where many claim the best chicken rice is this part of the city. There are dozens other stalls selling a variety of other dishes and drinks but the (long) queue is perpetually at Tian Tian. However good their chicken rice is (and at SG5, very affordable), there are other establishments serving good food, as well. We tried the oyster and carrot pancake next door and they were great.The beehon located in the adjoining wing was very tasty too. Prepare to fall in line especially during rush hours (we went at 3pm and there was still a line...). There is no airconditioning, just electric fans, so get ready to sweat a bit."
,,It's OK,4.0,,Really a long queue for Tianian Chicken Rice Tastes Ok but not worthy of a half-hour queuing. Other food are just average. Price is as reasonable as other Hawker Centres. Location is good so many tourists.
,,"good price, clean, close to Chinatown.",4.0,,"normally high living cost in Singapore may concerned by most tourist, food centre is a good choice for budget. The location, affordable price and facilities are standard and satisfied."
,,This is where you go for Chicken Rice,4.0,,Friends suggested to go to Maxwell Rd Hawker Center for Chicken Rice. We were not disappointed. The Chicken Rive at Tien Tien was excellent and the rice cooked in the chicken broth is delicious. A must revisit place the next time I am in Singapore
,,Busy,5.0,,Plenty of variety for the most choosy of eaters. Although always busy this hawker's place offers excellent value with little or no fuss.
,,Dodgy - Don't waste time here,2.0,,"I love Singapore... and I love food. Indeed, one of the main reasons I visit Singapore is for the street/hawker food (in addition to the fact that Singapore is clean, safe, polite and has a very good public transport system). This trip I decided to try the Maxwell Road Hawker Centre as I had missed it on my previous stays. What a total disappointment... the 1st sign that things weren't right was the lack of patrons... then, there was the smell (hard to describe, but dodgy). There was a sign stating that the centre had been closed for a day or two (a few days before my visit) for cleaning, but I'm not sure what they had cleaned as the whole joint was dodgy. I limited myself to Ice Kachang, which was very refreshing in the heat & humidity on the day. There are a lot better places to eat in Singapore."
,,Tian Tian chicken rice!,4.0,,"I recently went to Maxwell food centre to find the famous Tian Tian chicken rice. Although the queue was long (I waited for about half an hour), it wasn't nearly as long as the nearby Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice and Noodle in the Chinatown Food Complex. The chicken rice was delicious, definitely the best I've had in Singapore. I'm giving in 4 stars because many of the food stalls are closed on the weekends and the seating is limited for the number of people who come here. We were a party of 2 and had a constant stream of people joining us at the table, making it very crowded. I recognize that it is a food centre and not a restaurant, but it would have been nice to have had a table to ourselves."
,,Busy but delicious,4.0,,"The place packed with tourists and locals alike, delicious and inviting stalls. However it is very hot and humid so it's uncomfortable while we ate."
,,Fantastic value - Sisaket Thai,4.0,,"If you don't mind sharing a table and eating out of your comfort zone you'll love this place. The beer is cheap, the lime juice cold and refreshing and the Thai food we had (green curry, mango salad and pineapple rice) enough for two was delicious and only cost $12.50! The two ladies running the stall were a delight."
,,A wide variety of delicious and inexpensive food to be found here,4.0,,"There are many stalls selling good food here - fish soup (Jin Hua is my favourite), porridge, chicken rice, wonton noodles, nonya kueh etc. The place is full of local flavour and is conveniently located within walking distance of Tanjong Pagar MRT station."
,,Value for money,4.0,,Never visit Singapore without calling in here at least twice! Chicken rice is awesome. Trades late and always busy. Not far from Chinatown.
,,Lunch at Maxwell Center,2.0,,We have eaten here a few times but on our last visit we were very disappointed. The wasn't a lot of stalls open even though it was lunchtime and the quality of food had gone down.
,,Go for everything n bring friends!,5.0,,"My advice when u come here is not to come alone! Friends mean that you can try and share all this fabulous local street food. The porridge, five spice mixed meats, chicken rice, fishball noodles and nasi briyani..etc are all must tries!"
,,Just a hawker ctr. Nothing fantastic,3.0,,"Food: average Variety: average Price: average Cleanliness: good Frankly, the standard have dropped, many stalls are closed. Which food do I recommend? None. Price is close to that of hawker pricing. Else, I'd say, no point making a 'special trip' just for food."
,,Casual Lunch or dinner,4.0,,"This is a typical singaporean hawker food centre with high ceiling fans and a warm atmosphere is expected. Food prices are reasonable, displayed and paid in cash. All manner of local food from Chinese , Indian and Malay food are sold. Very busy during peak lunch hour but eases in the evening."
,,"Vibrant, noisy and delicious.",4.0,,"Myself and two colleagues from overseas ate at these hawker markets twice during our stay in Singapore. The food selection is ample and caters for all tastes and individual dishes as required. The food is presented well and the quality is of a high standard. Visitors to Singapore can't go wrong at these markets, the satay, seafood, rice dishes and specialities from regional areas are all delicious and are delivered to your table quickly and the beer is cold and at a reasonable price. The mixture of local people and tourists add to the vibrant nature of the markets and is a great way to start your evening on the streets of Singore. Well worth the visit and a guarantee you will return for more fresh and delicious food."
,,Good and famous,4.0,,"People go there for good, not pricey local food- like Hainanese Chicken Rice. The choice is great but you may get the same quality and even better prices at Chinatown Market Hawker Centre. If people queue somewhere, it might indicate that the food is really good there (or the vendors are slow;-))."
,,GOOD PRICE GOOD FOOD,4.0,,"We tried the Maxwell Road Hawker centre, it was a Monday night not every shop was open but the food was nice and the prices were good. It was not overly busy so easy to get served and easy to get a table."
,,Loved the variety of food.,5.0,,"We had a variety of Satays, the best I have eaten, Loved the atmosphere and all the food looked amazing. Best and cheapest way to eat in Singapore. Beer was cold too."
,,Don't miss...Maxwell Road,4.0,,Don't miss Maxwell road hawker centre. You should eat Tian Tian Hainanese chicken rice (Stall 10 and 11) .
,,people go here for the chicken rice,3.0,,":( after 45 minutes in a queue we gave up, it is very popular, if you want to eat this much raved about meal join the queue before midday"
,,Good selection and cheap meals,5.0,,"The chicken and rice at Tien Tien was great. The frid rice from another vendor was also very good. The whole place was quite clean. You can eat good simple food for a fraction of the cost of restaurants.

We went at dinner time on a week day and got a table reasonably easy, although there were only a few free.

We ended up getting dinner for 4 people for under $20 excluding drinks."
,,Make the most of trying lots of things - avoid lunch time,5.0,,"Cheap, fast and tasty, those are the three words I'd use to describe this place.

Here's some of the dishes I'd recommend
Tian Tian Hainanese chicken rice - it's a well trodden foodie path, it's no nonsense, it's succulent, and the rice is fragrant. There is no bs here.
Maxwell centre Fuzhou Oyster cake - stuffed with pork mince,prawns and oyster, it's deep fried and a great tasty snack - kind of like a big flattish takoyaki - it's piping hot so be careful
Ondeh-Ondeh tapioca cake: a good not too sweet snack to finish off your meal, also purchase a sugar cane juice to cool you down

Some tips:
*Avoid lunch time
*Grab a table first, reserve a seat by placing a business card, tissue packet or something else (of non value) on the seat.
*Most places are self-service (no, this doesn't mean you plate your own food, just means you wait at the stall and take your food to your own table). Some places will bring your food to you, so grab a table and remember the table number.
Halal and non-halal food are served on different coloured plates so do not mix them when you're finished - stack your plates so it's easier for a cleaner to take. Don't use halal food cutlery on non-halal food unless it's disposable.
*Just enjoy the experience. It's cheap and cheerful at it's best

Afterwards wander over to the Buddha Tooth museum and take the time to visit the Singapore City gallery to learn all about the history of development of this island nation"
,,Eat with the locals,4.0,,"We like to immerse ourselves in the culture when travelling and hawker markets are great for this. We wandered the stalls and chose what we wanted. We were having breakfast so some stalls weren't open. Never seemed to find them all open - each day seemed to find different ones opened or closed.
Breakfast was good with pastries - my favourite was a soft flat roll filled with cream cheese and dried cranberries - delicious. And local iced coffee that was strong and sweet - made with evaporated milk.
We also had dinner one night - the famous Hiannese chicken. Looks really plain, but definitely try it - full of flavour.
A bit of construction work going on around it (for a new train station), but don't let that deter you - just get in there.
We found all the local traders to be friendly and patient with us in explaining what the dishes were."
,,"Chicken rice, outstanding",5.0,,"Had to have chicken rice somewhere, heard about Anthony Boardain going to this hawker centre and chose to go there. Had our 4 year old with us so went early, wasn't to busy, apart from the site he bought his chicken rice from! I bought mine from another one and it was great. Also had oyster omelettes also very good. Would recommend all food here, but don't think you need to que where Anthony went"
,,Many things to choose,4.0,,"I went there about 11 am. to have some hawker food. I had Chicken Rice which is famous in Singapore, good taste and nice seller."
,,"Basic, cheap local food.",1.0,,"We have eaten at many Hawker centres, Warungs & markets and enjoyed most. Maxwells has a good vibe although very hot so pick a cool night to go there. We tried a few dishes from different stalls and were very disappointed with the quality."
,,Best Hawker in the Island,5.0,,"The fish soup noodle, hu xiang me hoon, peanut soup with tang yuan, hainanise chicken rice, Cantonese porridge, Teoh chew porridge, ham Chee Peng and a full list of delicious hawker food can be found here. Even Thai food too. A single trip will not be enough to taste all the delicious food here. But beware of your body weight if visit too frequent."
,,So many choices!,5.0,,Some of the best and cheapest food you can imagine! Everyone's taste is catered too with a multitude of choices. My suggestion is save the money on food and spend it at some nice bars around the city and take in the views!
,,Chicken Rice queues worth the wait,5.0,,This is a god hawker centre located next to China town so it's a good place to plan to visit as you move around the city. There are some long queues for Chicken Rice at lunch time so I decided to join one and see what the fuss was about - was not disappointed and well worth the wait.
,,Good Hawker Centre,4.0,,"Cheap food and good quality (mostly), and cheap beer. Located in Chinatown, this is quite a 'local' place, although attracts a lot of tourists. The food is almost all local though and quite a lot to choose from - doesn't appear as 'touristy' as other well-known hawker centres.

Can be quite busy and hot - with no a/c and just fans to cool you down. But a decent atmosphere all the same.

Getting there a bit of a pain at the moment due to all the construction, but worth it when you do get there"
,,"Good Food, Homie atmosphere",4.0,,"Tipical hawker center but much bigger and cleaner as well as offers wide array of food from chinese, malay to indian food. A bit hard to find seats especially during lunch and dinner time."
,,Not as good as advertised,3.0,,"Lots of road works and development in the area due to a new MRT station being built. Food was good, but not exceptional as expected. Cheap eats and beer were a drawcard. Not much of an atmosphere, hawker market in Newton was better."
,,Great hawker centre for our family,4.0,,Went to Maxwell hawker centre twice during our recent Singapore trip. Tried the famous chicken rice and also duck and a range of food all of which was great. Lots of variety we found and a great juice place with sugarcane and lime juice. Centre was clean and tidy and toilets were good.
,,Eat like locals,5.0,,"Some said that it would be a place for tourist only and that made us a bit considered as we would like to enjoy the city as locals did. However, we fell in love with Maxwell right from the first time we visited it. The centre was clean and convenient. Food was very tasty and cheap, even my Singaporean friend who accompanied us loved the food here. After that, we came back the centre for three more times :) Really love it."
,,Great Eats,4.0,,"Maxwell Hawker Centre is a favourite of ours, plenty of choices to eat at very cheap prices. The building is open aired, like all the hawker centres, but plenty of fans to keep the air moving, and relatively clean for the amount of people using it. Currently undergoing some renovations to allow more buses to park, this centre is probably the main tourist attraction on organised tours, so just be aware that it can get very busy here."
,,Hawker food,5.0,,Hi the thai food and the dough in this maxwell market is super duper delicious. Well known for. Do not miss Oh not forgetting the soya bean stall üëçüëçüëçüëçüòãüòãüòãüòã
,,Not Expensive Local Food,4.0,,"This is a food centre that serves all kinds of local food. From Malay to Indian to Chinese but predominantly local Chinese. The most popular is the Chicken Rice, there are more than three stalls here. Since the food is not expensive, you should also explore a few others depending on your appetite. Some stalls only operate in the day, have early lunch or dinner to avoid the crowd. Wear something comfortable because it can get very warm at times. Everything is self-service."
,,This is an insitution for Singaporean hawker food...,5.0,,To pick any of the stalls and talk about only about the few is to do great injustice to the entire experience. This is a place you should spend a good hour of so just to survey the things you might want to try. There is even interactive portions where you get to help cook what you want to eat. Bring an open mind and an empty stomach to get the most out of this place.
,,Hawker Food for Tourist,4.0,,"As an expat living in Singapore, I would like to share my experience on Maxwell Rd Hawker Centre.
Been to about 10 other Hawker Centres in Sing and this is a bit better than others.
* Cleanliness - So so....
* Atmosphere - Lively & crowded during meal times, obviously
* Food - Above average with a better than usual Hawker Centre mix
You get more tourists here than any other hawker centres around, simply because it is walking distance from Chinatown.
Usual tourist crowd, but coincidentally, it has a very good variety of food ranging from Chinese (mostly), Indian & Malay.
Not just a good mix but also better than average.
Tourists come to Sing for the famous Chicken Rice and this hot spot for tourists have more than its fair share, with more than 3 stalls selling them.
I shall not judge them but the one with the longest queue would be ""Thien Thien Chicken Rice""
I have tasted better.
The famous local saying goes :
"" The stall with the longest queue with the Owner having a long face (in Hokkien: Bin chow chow) must be good ! ""
I do not have a penchant for stall names, however, the best stalls would be the :
* Hum Jin Peng - Chinese donuts minus the hole (to me, the best in Sing)
* Teochew Porridge - Among the best for hawker Teochew porridge (long face/queue)
The Chinese Donuts is a Must Try, however, they are open only in the afternoons."
,,Shanghai tim sum,3.0,,"Try the shanghai tim sum especially the hot & sour soup that is a little spicy but more to the tangy side which will definitely whet your appetite before you indulge in the chicken rice!
The zhen zhen porridge is good too but it closes as early as 2pm."
,,ÂÜ≤ÁùÄ‚ÄúÂ§©Â§©Êµ∑ÂçóÈ∏°È•≠‚ÄùËÄåÊù•,3.0,,"#Â§©Â§©Êµ∑ÂçóÈ∏°È•≠# As a Chinese, Tiantian's chicken rice is not bad, but just so so. The chicken is very tender, tasted is light."
,,Great place to eat cheaply,4.0,,"A great place to visit but not necessarily for the Tian Tian chicken as the queue was huge. As a result I picked a place that had a smaller queue and had a fantastic curry. The food was superb and it was very well priced. Great atmosphere , a bit hot but an experience that you have to do."
,,Famous Hawker Fare!,5.0,,"Here are my favourite stalls at Maxwell. Google them for exact stall number but here they are.

The Popiah
The Shanghai Dim Sum stall
The Fish Soup
The Hainanese Curry
Tian Tian Chicken Rice

Go & have a ball at this place! You gotta go here if you're in the Tanjong Pagar/Chinatown area or you can even walk there from Outram Park for that matter.

Nothing is too far in Singapore."
,,Worth it to see the diferent food stalls,4.0,,"Like in the title, worth a visit. Take the Mrt to China town then take exit A. Walk to the end then turn right, cross over and the hawkers centre is on the left. Take the table number then order your food from the many different types to choose from. A decent cheap meal!"
,,its either a breakfast then Chinatown; or a lunch after Chinatown,5.0,,"Maxwell center is a definite must-do eat place, if your headed to Chinatown. The sheer variety of cuisines, each being a treat in its own right, is something that'll keep you coming back. The Chicken rice stall, or the Porridge stall are what many will suggest.. but you should walkabout & savour the place, and understand what is on offer. in the far corner are the Indian stalls, and a worthwhile bite in themselves. The variety of drinks' stalls also makes for a good compliment to the meal you'll be having. If you're unsure what to have, just look about at the tables to see what others are having...."
,,Birthday celebration,4.0,,Maxwell food centre has the wide variety of local food. Most of them are famous and delicious... although it's a bit warm to eat there. But the sweat is definitely worth for exchange of the yummy yummy food!!@
,,Visit early for a great experience.,4.0,,"We lined-up for the famous Tian Tian.....excellent chicken rice. We tried noodles, carrot cake and peanut pancakes. We were there at about 10.30am on a Sunday morning.....there weren't too many people there at that time. Prices were cheap....food was amazing. Overall a fantastic experience."
,,Hawker Food,4.0,,Always reliable and filled with hungry locals and some tourists. Lots of variety in the food stalls. Spot the ones with the longest queues and you are on to a winner. We dined on our favorite - oyster omelette which was mouth watering.
,,Good option of foods!,4.0,,"I came here for last minute dinner, around 9:30 pm and surprised there were some food stalls still open. Then i chose Laksa for my dinner, it was delicious with reasonable price. Will be back for my hawker visit routinity in Chinatown area!"
,,Lots of Variety,4.0,,"A very popular place, crowds there, but many places to choose to buy food from. Cheap and quick service. It is hard to choose what to eat with all the delicious smells emanating from the stalls. Great atmosphere."
,,Very Popular!,4.0,,We had read and heard so much about the Maxwell Road Hawker Center. After trying twice to get the famous Chicken and Rice and failing we opted for other meals and were still very pleased. If you want to get Chicken and Rice be sure to get there when they open (around 10 am) since they only make a certain amount. Do not bother to go around lunch time since it is packed with office workers. Worth a trip!
,,Favourite Singapore food place,5.0,,"My family and I love to come here for their cheap and good food.

Food stalls that you can't miss, just to name a few
Oyster fritter cake
Zhen Zhen porridge/congee
Fish head Beehoon-Opp congee stall
Vegetarian food
Tian Tian chicken rice
Japanese ramen
Sweet potato balls
Wanton noodles

Best you can never forget the taste"
,,Local Heaven,5.0,,"Looked at trip advisors reviews of top hawker sites in Singapore and this was near the top of the ratings. It is one of the best we visited too.
At our lunchtime visit it was crowded, noisy, hot and a little smelly, but the most wonderful local experience of old-time Singapore.
As in a lot of the literature, you find a spot to sit and reserve it by leaving an umbrella, packet of tissues, a few business cards with rubber band around them, in fact any personal property to claim your seats. Then wander around the many stalls until you find something delicious, which isn't that hard. Look for the longest lines....that's sure to be the best food. Most stalls now have a sign saying "" self-serve"" which means wait for your food and take it to your own table, rather than the old custom of the stall holders delivering to you.
Most stalls specialise in only a few dishes, but they make so many they are very quick and efficient.
Highly recommended!"
,,Great place to eat traditional foods,4.0,,"We ate here on our first day (and subsequently came back). It took a bit of working out - the choice seems overwhelming - but we took the view that the busiest stalls were going to be the best! It offers good value for family meals, rather than restaurants, and was a great place to try a range of traditional foods. The stall holders were friendly and helped us negotiate our way round their menus."
,,Tian tian: good chicken rice,4.0,,"Good chicken rice

No soup/sauce included (except red pepper). Despite that, very tasty indeed, but not so spectacular that i will go through the line/wait (30 mins) again. I am sure there are good alternative in the food center with less wait and will check them out :)

Overall very much Recommended as part of local experience!"
,,Local Taste,4.0,,"You did not come to eat what you eat at home, so come and try some good home cooking. The stalls have a letter rating posted letting you know how they compare to other stalls. A, B and so forth. Sugar Cane juice and Ice Lemon tea are so refreshing. You must try some local desserts. There is a corner stall where a man sells Peranakan desserts that are very tasty. See the Buda Tooth Temple then come in have lunch and head back to explore Chinatown."
,,Great Variety with Some Traditional food,4.0,,I like the variety that this hawker center has compared to many food centers in Sinapore. The dim sum & pau (buns) are chunky and porridge stalls serve yummy light eat. The traditional foo chow oyster fritters was a good find.
,,Halal food available,5.0,,Great place even though it's hidden away. Also some halal food as well as Chinese food. We ate at the Malaysian stall and had the beef curry and my wife a noodle soup.
,,A Lot Of Choices,5.0,,There is so much to eat here but unfortunately there is just not enough time and stomach space for all the food. We wanted to tried the famous Tian Tian chicken rice but the queue is just insanely long hence we decided to try the chicken rice 2 stall away from Tian Tian and we werent disappointed as it is nice as well.
,,Good Food Good Price,4.0,,This is the place to eat if you want traditional SG food. From chicken rice to fruit to curry that will made you wonder what the sauces are made from. The variety and cost are unbelievable.
,,"Standard food, Nice price",4.0,,"Is the perfecet place to go for lunch or dinner. A lot of different dishes from different countries just for 3-4$. The quantity is ok, the quality ok too. things to keep in mind: the place is hot and not so clean, so it¬¥s a survival place."
,,Variety to choose,4.0,,"There must be over one-hundred stalls, offering a massive variety of food for nearly all tastes.Love the Jin Hua fish soup bee hoon, Tian Tian chicken rice and even the 24 hour bak chor mee sua which is great for late night dining!

Love the fresh FISH soup stalls here and the fresh juice stalls here too.
The most amazing part of this hawker place is the Coconut milk juice stall
across of the overrated Hainanese chicken stall that Ramsey and Bourdain
love. It's like soup NAZI from Seinfeld, but just rude and doesn't deserve
any of my MONEY or praise because their chicken rice wasn't good at all."
,,A Singapore experience,4.0,,"The food is is delicious and the atmosphere is something that's uniquely Singaporean. Between the crowds, aroma and sights. It's truly more than just your typical dining experience."
,,Chicken Rice Haven,4.0,,"This place located just a stone throw away from Chinatown. It is not too big yet not too small too. Quite some options of food - a little bit of everything but don't expect too much. However you can put high hopes on chicken Rice. Tian-Tian Chicken Rice is known as the best hawkers stall chicken rice in Singapore and the queue can get crazy long. But fret not because 4-5 other chicken Rice stalls around are also good, especially for people that don't like to line hungry."
,,No 71 Maxwell Food Market,5.0,,"Outstanding food! No 71 is the place to be! Number 6&7 on the menu is outstanding. It's in the middle row and will undoubtably have a queue, but do wait. Funny guys with a passion for what they do."
,,Old school,4.0,,This is one of the few old markets situated in the CBD besides Amoy street and Hong Lim centre. It's famous for its Chin Chin chicken rice amount other good food. It's very crowded during lunch hours. The tapioca kueh here is also very good. Be sure to check it out.
,,The It-Center,5.0,,"Maxwell Center is the most popular hawker center of Singapore and has often been featured in magazines or on TV. One reason might be its central location, but it is also known for the best Chicken and Rice in town. Get it at Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice Stall."
,,Down to basics in Singapore,4.0,,"An open-air under-cover eating experience with several rows of fresh food stalls, each with their speciality, and rows of tables and seats interspersed. We lunched the last two days on freshly cooked (while you wait) mainly Chinese style food. The turnover is rapid so you can be sure the food is fresh.
And where can you get good lunch for two for under $10."
,,So much to choose from,4.0,,Maxwell road food hawker centre is a great place to have genuine Singapore food at the same low price the locals pay for it. Eat in a multi ethnic environment and all ages and types of people. I went twice with friends. Have look at people's plates to get an idea of what you might like. I paid 4:50 for a large laksa which tasted lovely.
,,Chicken Rice Great,4.0,,"Tried Tian Tian chicken rice and loved it. Gave the Ah Tai stall a go at the same time as we had a group. As per other reviews the cook left Tian Tian and set up shop pretty close by.

We rated the Tian Tian higher but line was pretty long.

Also loved the ""Oyster cake"" from the Maxwell Fuzhou Oyster Cake stall.

Went at lunch time which meant it was hot enough to warrant ice in my beer..."
,,A good hawker centre to visit,4.0,,"This is a local hawker centre that has many good hawkers (or street food vendors as it is known in other countries). These hawkers are either 1st, 2nd or 3rd generation hawkers that were brought together and house in this gawker centre during the years when Singapore was developing. One of the famous streets where these hawkers used to sell street food were from China street which is near to the current location of Maxwell Hawker centre. Here you will find some of these hawkers having their signboards with the title of China Street added.

There are many good stalls here notably the following:
1. Prawn Fritters (Ngoh Hiang Kwan Chiang). There are two stalls. One in the middle and another facing Maxwell Road or a church building.
2. A dessert stall serving Tau Suan, peanut soup, and others
3. A delicious porridge stall
4. A great stall selling fish soup
5. A chicken rice stall next to the Tian Tian Chicken Rice. The original Tian Tian cook left and open a stall next to it. There was a fallout. So the current Tian Tian cook is NOT the original cook
6. A fried dough stall selling ""hum chern paeng"" where a lady is frying the dough. This was a dad and daughter team. But the dad had retired. Fun part here is you help them fry the dough. Good snack
7. A lady who took over her mum selling ""tum paeh"". A snack which has oysters embedded. Must try.

An experience to go or if one needs some good hawker food."
,,Good variety of local food,4.0,,"Great local food, ranging from chinese, chicken rice, thai, indian, etc all under one roof. Cheap and delicious. The stall vendors are also friendlier than other hawker centres. Good for a cheap and enjoyable lunch or dinner."
,,Delicious Chicken Rice,5.0,,"I went to Tian Tian. It was great, the chicken was really juicy and tender. The queue was long but was quick. Portion was awesome."
,,Great Singapore Hawker Food,5.0,,"Maxwell Road Hawker Centre is a great venue to experience the authentic culinary tastes that Singapore can offer. Chinese favourites as well as well as Malay satays and all at local prices! The food is always fresh, the service prompt with no nonsense !
Wander around first and look at what each stall has to offer.
Of course the range is great so making up your mind might be a problem!
Expect to have to hunt for a table on weekends as it is very popular with local residents.
It is lovely too how they have embraced diversity well with a lot of the staff who tend the tables people who might often be left unemployable because of age or disability! A great example of Modern Singapore at its best!
Visit next time you are there! The corner of Maxwell Road on the edge of Chinatown."
,,"Slice of local life, share a table",4.0,,"Came here with siblings and friends from out of town. I love bringing friends, local or visiting, here as it's a far cry from the touted (haha) Newton Food Centre. This is very much a slice of the local lifestyle. The slightly dim lighting, open-air sweaty ambience, and strangers sharing tables is part of the locals' daily routine of eating here. The infamous Tian Tian Chicken Rice is highly sought after, but consider the neighbor next door if you are in a rush and can't stand waiting in line. $2-3 fruit juices are amazing. And the old cleaner aunty or uncle may insist on helping you out, but you could help clear your cutlery in peak hours."
,,Tian tian chicken rice overrattd,2.0,,He chicken rice at tian tian is overrated.. Is so normal chicken rice.. The soup restaurant nicer and even removed all bones.. About same price in air cond condition and restaurant service
,,Authentic hawker experiennce,4.0,,"Maxwell Road Hawker center is still currently undergoing a renovation (as of Jul 16). The place is easy enough to find, with extremely reasonably priced hawker style food available. Free seating, non air-conditioned and serves food from the morning untill well after midnight. The overhyped Tian Tian chicken rice aside, the place is also host to a plethora of other local delights, like the fried sweet potato dumplings (vegetarian but may contain peanuts and gluten) and the Hainanese Curry rice."
,,How can food this good be so cheap?,5.0,,"Amazing experience. Wait in line for the roast duck and pork and you will not be disappointed. We went twice on a visit to Singapore and found early dinner to be a much better time to go than lunch. Even so, make this a go to place in Singapore when you visit."
,,Home of good hawker food,5.0,,"Maxwell Hawker Centre is a but of an institution especially as now it's the home of Tian Tian Chicken Rice which is in the Michelin Guide. The Q for this chicken rice is always very long even though there are other chicken rice stalls at this famous hawker Centre.
Besides chicken rice it has good oyster pancakes which although very oily are completely delicious.
You must also try the ondeh ondeh here. This is a green round ball desert filled with gula Melaka brown sugar. When you bite into the ball the sugar flows out. It's a really interesting sensation."
,,A Historical Food Haunt,3.0,,"It is one of the original old time hawker center not far from Chinatown that I used to favour for variety and taste. Sadly, like many of the food centers, it is a shadow of what it used to be as the food quality has diminished; disappointed."
,,A lot of different food to taste,5.0,,"We enjoyed tasting differnet kind of food from around asia. Good place to eat budget, a must for backpackers coming to Singapore!"
,,A Taste of Singapore Food,5.0,,"I know many of us shudder at the thought of having to brave the heat and humidity most time of the year in Singapore to eat at a Hawker Center. But believe me, if you want a authentic taste of local food you will have to do that! The experience cannot be duplicated in some sterile air conditioned environment. Maxwell is one of the best places for a sampling of local food. You eat where the locals eat. The thing is - even at stalls without a long line waiting for food the standard of food is good! Give it a shot!"
,,An interesting experience,4.0,,Not my favourite hawker centre but it's worth going just for the chicken. We went late at night so it was fairly quiet and many of the places were shut so check your times before you go.We still enjoyed ourselves though and would love to return when there's more choice.
,,great for groups who want different types of food!,5.0,,This Hawker centre is a must for any visitor to Singapore. It's not too big so you can quickly see what's on offer and make your choices. It was great as we all wanted something different and our son (14) was a little wary of the Asian foods.so we tried a bit of something from different places! All great value as was the drinks which you buy separate! Great atmosphere!
,,Popular chicken rice,4.0,,My husband and I made the trek to this hawker centre today. We took the MRT to Chinatown and then walked to the food centre. We ignored previous reviewers advice about getting there early to avoid the queues and boy did we suffer! The queue to the famous Tian Tian chicken rice stall was out the door. We had come this far so decided to wait in line. In the end we would have waited a good half an hour. We are seasoned chicken rice eaters and would rate this as well above average - 8.5/10. We did miss the absence of the soup but everything was full of flavour and it's extremely well priced. Unbelievable how long the queue was when we left.......
,,A MUST WHILST N SINGAPORE,5.0,,"We joined the long queue (over 30) at Tian Tian for their famous Hainanese Chicken and Rice ($12 half $24 whole) half was enough for 2 we also had steamed greens with oyster sauce.
Chicken is fragrant moist and really delicious... A stall 2 doors down has a sign saying he is the original chef from Tian Tian, however, he had no customers.
A great place to eat and enjoy local well cooked food. Freshly juiced fruit drinks from only $1.50 are also quenching.
Take your own paper towel and or wipes as none are provided."

,,Good food with big crowd at lunch hour...,4.0,,"It is a nice hawker with a lot of good food. Try to go before lunch hour or u need to q for your food especially famous stall. I personally recommend few following stall:
1. The traditional friend five spice meat roll. Very yeasty with the fried noodle. Try the one with pork liver, really a delicacy.
2. The Hainan mix vegetables rice with lot of curry gravy on top. The pork chop is really yummy...
3. I try the famous chicken rice stall call Tian Tian. Not recommended, the chicken is too soft n not tasty.
4. One of the stall sell the peanut soup is really good. Very traditional dessert.."
,,rather inconvenient location,3.0,,"It is located in a busy business district in the daytime but very quiet in the evening. The nearest carpark is pulled down and some big construction is going on right now. Since the location is rather far away from those places tourists usually visit, it has not many food stalls open during the evening period. Many stalls closed down and the whole food centre seemed to be dark.
However, it may be worth to go during the lunch hours but it is crowded for many office workers having lunch there."
,,Secrets behind China Town,4.0,,"Not just taking Chinese food or buying souvenirs from China Town, you could make your way to the nearby hawker centre. There is always a long queue waiting for a taste of the famous Hainan Chicken Rice. To be honest, this was already the third trial for the different chicken rice but this time is the best. If you still want some dessert, I would recommend you to have a bowl of Lao Ban Soya Beancurd. It is amazing to find a layer at the top of the dessert which means they serve the best quality of the soya beans."
,,Food Centre with many great food,4.0,,"Maxwell Centre is a food centre i will visit for the Chicken Rice and despite the long queue, it never fails to satisfy my palette. There are also many other food stalls like the Teochew Porridge Stall and of course the Thai food Stall situated at the corner near to the main entrance. A Food centre not to be missed. Prices range from SGD2.50 onwards.

,,Chicken Rice Haven,4.0,,"Strategically located next to Chinatown and Club Street, Maxwell food centre is a must go hawkers center for Chicken Rice Lover!
There's one super famous chicken Rice stall here - you can notice by the size of the stall and the queue - but they also have at least 5 other chicken Rice stall that taste good too!"
,,Great food experience,5.0,,One of the things I love to do most in Singapore is eating at hawker centres. This one is ideally situated in Chinatown. It has a lot of choice for everyone - from the famous Hainanese chicken rice to fresh fruit. Went there already several times when I've been to Singapore and didn't regret it: The food I had there was always delicious. It's authentic and cheap.
,,Wonderful new experience,4.0,,"If u are looking for Street food in Singapore this is possibility the closest thing you would find. A wonderful myriad of stalls serving up tasty grub at really affordable prices. It's a tad warm, but the Singapore sweatshirt pretty common I reckon"
,,Food Paradise!,5.0,,"Go straight to 'Tian Tian', probably the best Chicken Rice in Singapore! There will be a queue. Just the perfect combination of rice simmered in chicken broth, succulent de-boned chicken (white or dark meat) and perfect chilli, ginger & garlic. No soup 'tho so suggest you order a plate of beansprouts, with which the cuttlefish is optional!

But leave a little space for an Oyster Cake, just a few stalls further to the left. VERY hard to find this in Singapore but MUSTRY!"
,,Great cheap food,5.0,,Went here for breakfast and then supper. Lots of variety a d it all tastes great. A meal is less than $6 in most cases and it's very filling. The shanghai tim-sum fried dumplings were a standout. All the hawker centres are great value
,,Great authentic atmosphere,5.0,,"Fabulous freshly cooked food. There is something for everyone. A real ""must visit"" place, very cheap, delicious food."
,,Singapore trip,4.0,,"My first trip to Singapore and want to try some local food. The best place must go to the hawker center, every one has theirs own foods and tastes."
,,"Tasty, authentic, cheap - don't miss it!",4.0,,"Local food center in Chinese district. Lot of food stalls offering from Hainan Chicken to noodle soup, fresh fruits, seafood etc. Perfect authentic taste and cheap. Far from an air-con lean restaurant, you will find here all local flavors of Asia. Don't miss it."
,,We want more! üòâ,5.0,,"This is definitely one of two hawker centres to taste local Singapore food. It is a must to go a little earlier to avoid peak periods during lunch and dinner. For lunch, go around 11:30 am, secure a table, and note down the table number. Next step is to order the food. Still not sure what to eat? No worries! The ubiquitous queues are a testimony to the popular dishes at this food centre and many more fantastic dishes that are waiting to be discovered. My favourite dishes have to be the spring rolls, rojak (fresh fruit/vegetable-salad in a unique prawn-based sauce), fish sliced soup in a delicious milky stock, and the famous chicken rice. Just give it a try for the taste, your value for money and rubbing shoulders with the locals."
,,A Foodie's Delight - 'The' place to try out local food,5.0,,"If you are a foodie and would like to try out local food then MFC is the place to do it in Singapore. This is like a large food court with over 50 stalls selling various kinds of local food (Singaporean, Chinese, Malay, Thai, Indonesian and Indian). This is the real fast food, but it is fresh fast food and most stores cook it fresh for each person (esp the soups and porridges). The pricing is so reasonable, you can have 3 satisfying meals a day for well under 10 USD.

The food is authentic as it can get, fresh, hot and tasty. You have a lot of options to choose from. If you want to know the more popular joints in there just look at the crowd in front of each store. My favorite place was a fish soup stall that was the first stall on the left aisle of the middle section.

Foods to try for sure are the Fish Soup, Fish Ball noodle soup (Bee Hoon), Laksa, PadThai, SugarCane Juice and finish it off with a Pisang Goreng (banana fritters). We had 3 meals here to make sure we tasted a good part of it, it is so good :-)"
,,Chicken rice is overrated,4.0,,"Stopped at the Maxwell FC for lunch while in Chinatown. Busy, hopping place. Very popular with the locals. Met nice people at our communal table.

Friends raved about the chicken rice at the Tian Tian Hianese stand. Sure enough there was a long queue attesting to its popularity but we're not sure what all the shouting is about. Strips of tasteless boiled chicken on a plate of rice with a spoonful of sauce. Healthy and inexpensive to be sure, but hardly worth a trip across town."
,,Best value awesome variety,5.0,,"This is our favourite little eat whenever we travel to Singapore. Hawker food, always a taste sensation, family owned stalls, great value!

Singapore is known to be expensive for alcohol especially in bars and clubs, we always enjoy a meal here and grab a couple of tall Anchor beers at $6 each (3rd aisle)"
,,BEST HAI NAN CHICKEN IN THE WORLD!!!!,5.0,,Hainan chicken is the best chicken dish I've ever tried in the world!!! MUST TRY THE HAI NAI CHICKEN!!!
,,A MUST,4.0,,"It's very crowded when lunch time. so around 11-12 is still bearable, you gotta try the famous tian-tian chicken rice, lao ban (beancurd), the porridge (but I forgot what is the stall call, just look for the most crowded one), and lastly the guo tie (fried dumpling)"
,,The best food in Singapore is always at hawker center,5.0,,"Maxwell Road Hawker Center is a very nice Asian food court at the edge of Chinatown. Every hawker specialises in a few dishes, which is why the food is always fresh, savoury and authentic. Food and drinks are ordered at separated hawkers and people seat at common tables in the alleys. It is the best way to explore Singapore's food scene at the most affordable prices."
,,Will come back again and again and again,4.0,,"Tried the famous fried oyster bun and I felt that it tasted great. Yes, it was a little oily but you can just take one piece. In Singapore, this particular food item has gone pretty extinct. Difficult to find it anywhere.
We also tried the wanton noodle. This stall is filled with articles on how good their food is. Being courageous, I tried their signature wanton noodle. Yes!! Their fuzhuo fishball is so juicy and it will splurt juice out when I bite it. Its noodle is not too soft, not too hard. Just nice! This bowl of wanton noodle is just so heavenly!!! :)
There are a lot of other good food in this hawker such as chicken rice, mee pok in ramen style etc etc.."
,,Great place to eat with locals,5.0,,Found this place when looking for a good place to eat in China town. Recommend it if you are in town for cheap but good eats.
,,Tasty food,5.0,,"Authentic Singapore food, great selection. Food served hot, drinks served with lots of ice. It absolutely hums at lunch time, people everywhere, lots of conversation. I was checking out other people's plates, they all looked nice n tasty. A real ""taste of Singapore"""
,,Huge place everybodies food,4.0,,"This was the first time I actually managed to get time to go here unfortunately peak lunch time and that in Singapore means forum 12 to 2
Huge variety huge crowds difficult to get a sitting place fast
Some counters had huge lines and so. E were empty
From Indian to salads to Indonesian Malaysian Thai Chinese so called continental all types of food was there
I had Chinese and was fresh made and good and I had juice
Reasonable priced"
,,Fascinating Slice of Local Food Experience,4.0,,"This Hawker Centre is right next to the Singapore City Museum and Gallery, and very convenient for a snack. It is riotous fun, with an enormous range of choices and and very much a shared experience. I wandered the venue first, then picked the longest line for food and ended up with a delicious chicken rice plate with wonderfully good chili sauce on the side. You won't regret any choice for food, based on what I saw around me. It's self serve for the most part, so expect to clean up after yourself and to share your table."

Chicken is tasty and rice is full of favour. They also have ""fried""chicken which is in fact delicious smoked chicken. I also had freshly made sugar cane juice. No air-condition, so be prepared for a sweaty meal. Cost is cheap. Food is as good as it can be for hawker centre. Worth a try if you want to see what the local fuse about their chicken rice. Try to arrive before 11.30 am otherwise you will have a long queue ahead of you."
,,"Great food, value for money!!",5.0,,Went there after a suggestion from our hotel receprionist and never regreted it! Value for money and quality local food in this gem in Chinatown. The environment is nothing enchanting-don't expect to find something fancy there. Only good food in descent prices!!
,,Classic Singaporean Hawker market,3.0,,Food and drinks were really good and cheap. The place was a bit dirty and very hot. There were extremely limited vegetarian options so it is not advised for vegetarians. Otherwise it gave a very authentic Singaporean experience.
,,Best Chicken rice in Singapore,4.0,,"You will easily find the stall/kitchen Tian Tian Chicken as it always has a long queue. You won't be disappointed this guy has perfected the simple dish, I don't think you can eat anywhere as tasty and as cheaply."
,,Maxwell Hawker Centre is a Foodie Junkie Hub,5.0,,"When I first learned from my wife that there is this stall in some hawker place that offers hainanese chicken that food critics, chef and reality show host Anthony Bourdain supposedly raved about, I knew she will not stop unless we find it. So, we hopped on a cab that promptly delivered us to the Maxwell Hawker Centre. It was good timing. The lunch hour was starting. Or maybe not, for when we descended the steps leading to the place, whoa, people were already lined up, sitted, in varying stages of gustatory high.

Follow the cue. The longer the line, the
My wife wanted to explore the Maxwell Hawker Centre because she heard about the Anthony Bourdain endorsed hainanese chicken stall sold only in this haven. She dared we brave the noon heat so try the dish ourselves. The longer the line of people, the better the food. I recall she telling me. But this time, she also said I look for Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken stall, for sure there's a line of people. So, I navigated through the spaces and the throng of lunch gladiators. Then there it was. Indeed, the stall had a line that extended to the back. I looked for my spot and I was about 30 people back. I waited for my turn and was rewarded with my purchase of the famous combo meal, with sprouts and bochoy with oyster sauce. And yes, the stall proclaimed it was Anthony Bourdain approved. So like it on Facebook, twit in twitter, hash tag it, post in Instagram and WhatsApp, for the best hainanese chicken rice this side of the world!

Of course there were other finds in the center. One is a stall were the ondeh-ondeh was going fast. I nearly didn't make it as I scored the last order. Yes!

Across Tian Tian is a frust juice stall that have vats of cool drinks that is needed in the Sinagporean lunch heat. I grabbed a lime drink, sugarcane juice and one coconut. Cool and refreshing these drinks that completed the chicken meal.

In Manila where paper napkins are always available in food courts or even hawker like joints, buying this sanitation tool from elderly women, is a bit of a shock. On both counts, buying the paper napkin and the elder woman selling them. But it's also a bit of paying forward.

The location of the Maxwell Hawker Centre is ideal, and easy to find. Though a portion is under renovation, it still offers a lot of food finds that offer excellent eating adventure.

When in Singapore, while there are many such places, if you want to taste the hainanese chicken rice that went viral, as Anthony Bourdain vouched for it, then don't skip this place.

Just wear light cotton clothes, bring your own napkins, and be ready for a savory, sweet, and satisfying food trip."
,,"Great food, simple Hawker Fare",5.0,,"I'm writing about not only Maxwell Rd, but the many other Hawker centres like Toa Payoh, Ang Mo Kio, Serangoon, Bukit Panjang, Adam Road etc. I worked in Singapore for a number of years and have recently returned for a 3 week break from the cold !! I have not eaten in a cosy restaurant in this 3 weeks, instead choosing to visit all the old local favourite Hawker centres I got to know well. I have not been disappointed. To an outsider, they may seem noisy at times, a little dirty on the looks and floor with simple tables, but the quality of food, quality of preparation and taste, not to mention the price - today's lunch was $4.00 for a full meal set - add to this a nice Lime Juice or Tiger beer 640ml bottle and you are on a winner.

The people are local and many look with interest at the ""Ang Moh"" - and the only ""Ang Moh"" in the centre ( basically translated as red hair fair skin foreigner ), but I urge you to get away from the main tourist spots and catch a bus to somewhere to try these wonderful places."
,,Lots of good food!,4.0,,"This should definitely be on your list if you are nearby. Lots of local food to choose from, delicious and at cheap prices."
,,The world is your oyster,5.0,,Good enough for Anthony Bourdain : - ) try these legendary fried oyster cakes at this lovely husband and wife team stall.
,,Review Maxwell Hawker,4.0,,"This is one of the oldest and biggest Hawker ctr. It is also conveniently located next to Chinatown if you are covering that area. Plenty of local food options. Cheap so you can order a few dishes for sampling. Bear in mind, it's an older Hawker ctr, so it is not very cosy. If you wish to dine in comfort in an air condition environment, most malls have nice foodcourts which serve local food. But would be average $5-$7. Over at Maxwell below that."
,,Best chicken rice in Singapore,3.0,,"This hawker centre is in the heart of Chinatown and gives a real flavour of street food. It is the home of the most famous (and warring) chicken rice vendors in Singapore and although it doesn't look great, the food is good, authentic and very cheap. Not as posh as Lau Pa Sat, the hawker centre in the CBD, the lunchtime queues are testament to the excellent value for money"
,,Tian Tian Chicken Rice,4.0,,"I had a day to kill in Singapore and a good mate who knows these things and he gave me a couple of things to do but Maxwell Food Centre is well worth passing on. I love street food anywhere, but Singapore is as good as it gets.
At Tian Tian be prepared to line up and don't get there at lunch time and also I believe they sell out by 2.00pm.
The rice was perfect. The Chicken moist and tender. The sauce perfect and the chili also just right. If Haikenese chicken isn't to your taste, then the choice at this food centre is almost limitless. Explore to your heart content."
,,Typical street food of Singapore,4.0,,"It was a good place to stop for a quick drink and a snack. We tried a ""Milo"" which is basically a strong chocolate milk drink served with ice. Lots of interesting food in this small complex not far from one of the underground railway stations. Choose what you want from one of the stalls and you pay when it's brought to you table. Cheap and cheerful but authentic."
,,Cheap eats,4.0,,"Great traditional hawker centre with all the local dishes you have come to know as famous in singapore, super reasonably priced which makes it a busy place at mealtimes with many locals and tourists alike"
,,Cheap and great local food.,3.0,,Variety of tasty local food at local price. Ate chicken rice for S$3.00 with S$1.00 coffee plus milk. .Avoid week day office workers' lunch time crowd (1pm ro 2pm).
,,Singapore style Hawker Food,5.0,,If you wish to enjoy some variety of local Singaporean style Hawker food here is the place you can try many of them at one place. It is local food for local people hence no modification to gather for tourist etc. Try local taste.
,,Singapore cuisines all in one place! Tips for visitors..,5.0,,"And so the coveted ""Tian Tian"" chicken rice has one of the longest queue i have ever seen. I didn't think its worth the queue, not that its no good, but as chicken rice is so common, there are many other places that's very tasty too.

This place is still worth visiting even if u don't eat the chicken rice. You can find lots of local food there, and experience the setting of a typical ""hawker center"" - where lots of tasty cheap eats awaits you. I just find queuing more than an hour under the sweltering heat is a waste of time and energy..

Don't just chose any other chicken rice stalls over there, i tried one, i regret.

Tip 1: I will skip the queue by going to other branches of ""Tian Tian"" to enjoy this dish. Their restaurant outlets can be more expensive, but heck, time is money. Decide on a branch with good reviews and location to suit your travel itinerary.

Tip 2: Try the fried banana at this stall called ""Lim Kee"". It can be quite filling, so do a take away, but have it while its still relatively hot and it will be nice and crunchy."
,,Great choices,3.0,,"A great wide range of food during the day. Towards the evening many of the shops will be closed. Prices are slight on the high side, around the mid range region for hawker food."
,,Delicious brunch!,5.0,,"My fiance and I were looking for a clean and cheap hawkre centre and finally we discovered Maxwell. We arrived at Chinatown bus station and just walked in a few minutes. First, they have a clean washroom. Food were great and cheap. We tried dimsum, porridge, dry noodles and coffee. There's a lot of foreigners eating. Indeed a budget friendly yet clean."
,,Lovely food,4.0,,"Go gere for Hainanese Chicken dish. Absolutely nice. There are 2 places who are famous I guess by the line of waiting customers. 1 is most popular, where the second is run by the former chef of the first one..... Both are very popular"
,,Great food at a great price,4.0,,"A bit hot and sticky but the fans help you stay comfortable. Had the chicken rice...5$ with a soup. Many different stalls...from malay, Indonesian, thai, chinese. Get a freshly prepared juice at one of the many stalls. Delicious!"

,,Great choices,5.0,,We stopped for lunch after visiting the Buddhist temple. Easy to get there from Chinatown. Great choices for food one place had food for less than a dollar with long lines of locals wanted to try but kids were very hungry. Beer was $4 cheap for Singapore and water was $1. Definitely worth a visit considering the multiple choices and friendly hawkers. Be sure to tip some of the older folk that clean the tables.
,,vistors dont be afraid,5.0,,"It may look rough and scary but don't be put off. The council inspects and grades the stalls and one day every few months the whole place closes for a day for a spring clean. Everything is so fresh. If you worry about the crowds go mid morning or mid afternoon. Walk around and order what looks good, I especially loved popiah fresh spring rolls. There are more hawker centres around Singapore so ask at your hotel where the closest is and even ask what their favourite dish is to get you started. Hawker centres are also cheap."
,,Food galore at Max!!,5.0,,"Local flavor are the main food theme here. What's there to try ? Too many to name!! But do come and just follow the queue lines and you won't be wrong. Those without queue lines are great too and may not be tourist well known. You can see Japanese chineses Korean and Asian nationality coming to try the food there. Starts from $1 for a drink to $1.50 for a meal. Names to look out for :
Tian tian chicken
Ah tai chicken
Hainese curry chicken
The centre end of row porridge is great."

There a a heap of options to choose from along with several stalls selling cold tiger beer which is perfect for the hot temperature of the food hall.
,,A place to have some singapore food,4.0,,"It just brings back memories when I come back here. Most of the time ordering chicken rice at Tian Tian, coupled with a plate of fried dumplings and fruit juice (sugar cane or soursop). Have a nice chat with friends/ colleagues. Before I leave, I would grab a few croquette with sweet potato fillings, it's just so soft and tangy."

The price is cheap for Singapore and they are delicious! A must try is Tian Tian Hainanese chicken rice, this is one of the best chicken rice I have had in Asia. We also tried lao ban soya beancurd(tofu pudding)while we were there, it's so silky! Maxwell food centre is self service and do get busy during lunch hour so visit after lunch hour to avoid the queues."
,,One of the BEST Hawker Centres in Singapore,5.0,,If you hungry and in the area go to the Maxwell Hawker Centre. Heaps of stalls and a great variety of different foods. Its cheap and don't forget to have a Tiger beer to wash it down
,,Interesting place to eat,4.0,,"Maxwell Road Hawker Center is much like any other place of this type, but this was much cleaner than many others and the variety of foods on offer is amazing, spend all day eating at very good prices. Well worth it . Went back many times."
,,Our favorite Food Centre,4.0,,"Tian Tian Hainan Chicken is the top 2 chicken rice we must visit everytime when we visit SG.

Another newly discovered store (for us) is the one selling Fish soup with noodles are super yummy!

Anyways, Maxwell is a must go food market in town!

There are a few other stores which would be appeared on tourist guide book.

As we are bring our baby with us, we just tried the chicken rice & fish soup with noodles."
,,Fabulous food,5.0,,"The most increadable tasting food reasonably priced, great atmosphere. The range of options available on the menu would suit anyone's appetite."
,,"Wide variety of offerings, but only during weekday lunchtime.",3.0,,"Maxwell Road Hawker Centre can be considered as a food paradise for visitors. Most importantly, it provides a wide variety of choices for office workers nearby during lunchtime, where they can enjoy delicious local cuisines without breaking the bank.

Though, one must take note that the choices tends to be limited if you were to dine during dinner time and weekend, since most of the office workers are not working at such hours.

Apart from the chicken rice, one can also try the following food in the hawker centre:

- Curry rice with assorted dishes
- Eurasian cuisine
- Peanut soup
- Fried red bean pastry
- Steamed tapioca cakes
- Assorted noodles
- Western cuisine
- Muslim food"
,,Just like walking thru the Oven,3.0,,"I visited this place a few years back for 5 mins max. I was super hot and quickly ran out.

My second visited was yesterday. I was in the area and decided to stopped by for Tian Tian Hainan Chicken Rice and Ah Tai (closed yesterday).

It was still super hot as same as last time I was there. I felt like walking thru the Oven.

While I wait in Q at Tian Tian stall and by the time I got my take away orders >>> I was soaking wet.

Definitely I will run over to try Chicken Rice from Ah Tai stall (take away order) that it. I will be done with this place.

Never been to any hawkers in Singapore that have the same level of heat as this one.."
,,Should definitely be on your list,4.0,,The food is good and the choices are endless. But it's really the experience that you go for. Bring a hearty appetite and cash.
,,Our favourite food court,4.0,,"Maxwell Food Centre is located on Maxwell Road in Chinatown, behind some construction at the moment, signs will direct you. This is no shiny tourist venue, it looks basic, but is full of locals, a good sign anywhere in the world.
Our system was for one to order whilst the other looked for a table, but tables can be held with a coat or umbrella etc. it seems to work.
They do wonderful fruit juices and it is worth trying them, i loved the lychee and the lime versions, so refreshing in hot climate.
The crispy duck with noodles was the best i tasted in Singapore, also the chinese chicken buns were great.
The prices were so good, half the price of the Newton centre, but the surrounding are not so new and shiny, a place for travellers, not for tourists.
BE brave, give it a try"
,,One of my favourite Hawker centres,4.0,,"Been here twice but went late afternoon and late evening so there wasn't the crowds, good amount of food to chose from and really cheap, try the chicken and rice, simple but favourite dish costs ¬£1-2 Just across the road from China town"
,,Tian Tian is the best,5.0,,"The Hainanese chicken rice is a must have. There was a short queue to order, but the line moved quickly. You must find a table. Learned you can place your umbrella or some napkins on table to hold it while you get your food and drinks from any one of dozens of food stall. Cheap meal for local foods."
,,Eat and Run,4.0,,"A great food court with lots of choices. The food was good and cheap. Try to avoid the peak times as it can get very busy . Singapore has many food courts , and this one is typical of what you can expect. The Chicken Rice was great."
,,Wasn't a fan,2.0,,"Maybe it was the food I got. The chicken was cold and flavourless. Mostly, rice with little meat. Probably wouldn't go back."
,,MY Favourite Singapore Hawker Centre,5.0,,"Like all the Singapore Hawker Centres, Maxwell is self service, find a table reserve it and then find your chosen food, easier if there is a group of diners. My favourite because of the variety, it still feels authentic and a bit less sanitised than the other centres. Most stalls are very good value, my favourite was roast duck from a vendor at the north end in the central portion. A good selection of cuisines."
,,Many options for food selction,4.0,,You will get confused what to choose for your meal cause there are so many options there. Try the one with long queue. It is worth to try. Alot of option for the refreshing drink too. The price is afforable
,,Disappointed,2.0,,Reviews on TripAdvisor suggested going to stalls with the biggest queues. We didn't have much time so couldn't. Food was average‚òπÔ∏è
,,Don't miss this,5.0,,"A gastronomic experience of epic proportions as a level of affordability for everyone.

It is a must and there is nothing to fear for those who have a weak constitution, the food is all sold by registered vendors who are regulated.

Just do it. Take the red line on the hop-on hop-off bus. It's so easy."
,,Eat with locals.,4.0,,"Made a point in eating at this market. Dish is prepared in front of your eyes. Fresh, delicious and reasonably priced."
,,Carrot juice,3.0,,"This remains a very popular hawker centre, particularly on weekday lunchtimes. I stopped here for a carrot juice on the way back from lunch in Duxton. Easy enough to get a juice without a long wait. Some of the food stalls had quite long queues."
,,A visit a day keeps the hunger away!,5.0,,"My husband and I made this our first port of call everyday during our holiday, so many food stalls to choose from, but you will end up finding your favourites as we did, so a good plate of food, nice cold beer and one iced Milo and we were ready for the rest of our day."
,,Good place to dine out or buy take away in Chinatown,4.0,,"Maxwell Food Centre is located on Maxwell Rd in Chinatown. This is the largest Food Centre and there are numerous stalls, here covering every style of food you could possibly want to eat. This is basically a Locals food hall as tourists are not as common here as at Lau Pa Sat.
This a real no frills venue. Having said that we bought some very nice wontons, soups and stir frys, which we ate there and had as takeaway as well.
If you‚Äôre on a budget or just want a quick cheap eat it is definitely a great place to visit."

,,Tin Tin Chicken Rice - YUMMMMMM,5.0,,This recommendation by a friend did not disappoint. There was a long line but it went really fast. Know your order and be efficient when you get to the counter. Defiantly worth waiting for. Took me all of 10 mins to inhale the plate of chicken and rice once I sat down. Soooo gooood.
,,Filling noodles,5.0,,"In the heart of Chinatown, a much cheaper option than the tourist traps close by. Dumpling soup from the Handmade Noodle store was my favourite feed in Singapore. Followed closely by their fried dumplings. It is hot in here, thankfully the big bottles of Tiger are a reasonable $7."
,,Still my favourite hawker centre in the CBD area,5.0,,"I have always love the variety of food here and the vibrant ambience. It's not so hot during the lunch time due to its improved ventilation. However, I noted the human traffic is affected by the mrt work here. Still, the food quality is not affected. I will continue to patronise this hawker centre."
,,Inexpensive and diverse selection of food,5.0,,"We came across this food centre at lunch time - packed to the brim with people. There are at least 3 'avenues' of food stalls with tables in the centre. You select your food from the stalls on display and pick a seat - if you can find one!
Our strategy was once we picked a stall, for one to order whilst the other scouted for an open seat and table.
By 2 pm the masses had dwindled some what and empty seats and tables were easier to come by. The risk of waiting until then though, is that stalls close as soon as they have sold out. The more popular stalls (those with the long queues) would therefore run out. But then again if you don't want to queue for so long, I would suggest getting there even earlier.
There is SO much food available. And multiple kinds of fresh fruit and fresh fruit juice selections. various stalls also sell soft drinks and water. So everything you need is right here.
You could probably come back every single day for a month and have a different meal.
Come hungry!"
,,Some nice stalls,3.0,,"This seems to be a popular point for Chinese tour groups, which we saw lining up for Hainanese chicken rice. In fact, there were over five such stalls, all with similar looking blue signboards.

Do try the popular oyster and prawn fritters, as well as the famous tapioca cake, or the ondeh ondeh. Prices have gone up though, and a box of tapioca cakes now costs $5.10.

We also had dim sum feom Hokee, as well as the handmade sotong and fish balls with noodles opposite it. If you want spicy food such as Indian or Malay dishes, there are three stalls at the end closest to the URA building."
,,Remember to try the Chicken Rice,4.0,,"One of the more established hawker centre that can get really crowded during lunch time. You will be spoilt for choice but my favorite is the chicken rice. In fact, there are about 3-4 competing chicken rice stores -- and I have tried two of them. Both I thought were excellent! I also rarely pass up an opportunity to get at least 2 popiah."
,,"Plenty of food at reasonable price, great chicken rice and congee!",3.0,,"Maxwell road hawker center is not a typical hawker center in Singapore. This place is ""BIG"" - plenty of dishes to choose from. The famous dishes are chicken rice and congee. Although I am not a big fan of chicken rice, the chicken rice at Maxwell road hawker center is really different.Chicken is juicy and tendering.. you can smell soup from the rice. I like the congee there (in different shop but same area), variety of selection there."
,,WOW wonderful food,5.0,,"A foodie friend of ours sent us to Singapore with a list of must do's and Maxwell had several stalls on the list. We went on a Monday and some of the stalls were closed but we did find a few that she recommended open and we treated ourselves to some really good honest, cheap eats. Mostly catering to the locals, the offerings were extensive in choice, seafood stalls, chicken stalls, fruit and smoothie stalls and more. I highly recommend this as a fun way to experience some fantastic food in Singapore."
,,Maxwell Food Center,5.0,,"went here for the hainan chicken rice at Tian Tian. Cost of the basic plate was 5 sgd.
the chicken was very soft and tender, rice very flavorful. the competitor, ah tat was ok, rice was more bland. cost also 5 sgd. there are many food stalls offering very different foods and fresh fruit drinks, costs inexpensive.
bathrooms are also very clean.
by mrt, get off the chinatown stop, pagoda st exit, right on south bridge st, left on maxwell rd."
,,Worth the visit to Singapore,5.0,,Exceptional street hawker fare - Tin Tin Hainan Chicken Rice is simply the best. The chicken was tender and delicious and the rice plentiful - get extra hot sauce if you enjoy such. Inexpensive and served quickly though a good queue. Referred by multiple locals and they seem to know.
,,Food experience,4.0,,"While a lot of people come here for the chicken rice, which is nice no doubt, but I normally come here for others.

Morning, I will go for the tapioca cake and ondeh ondeh. The tapioca cake is so soft and so flavorful, a must buy for me whenever i'm there. Ondeh ondeh are filled with gula malaka (palm sugar), one bite of it and the gula melaka will ooze out and you will feel so blessed. Do note, gula melaka is quite sweet so those who do not like sweet stuff, try in moderation.

Afternoon, I will go for the ham chim peng. Although the taste wasn't as excellence as before, but where else can you get to flip and fry your own ham chim peng? The experience itself worth the trip down. I personally like the salty version."
,,MAXWELL RD FOOD CENTRE,3.0,,Large asian food court. Tight space on busy day. Good food if happy to battle local crowd. Great variety . Better ones around if willing to travel
,,Non Touristy Hawker Center,4.0,,"Non-Touristy compared to others, however locals would probably say it has become touristy. Good eats at Tian Tian and another stand with duck and pig livers - Don't know name, sign in Cantonese. Get there early because they sell out fast and close the doors."
,,"Lots of choice, cheap prices, must visit",5.0,,"Maxwell Rd in Chinatown is one of the best food centres in SIngapore.
There are lots of options to choose so everyone will find something to eat.
Famous Tian Tian chicken rice is located here. There are lovely smoothies and fruity cold desserts to choose from too.
Definitely one place to visit and enjoy the food."
,,Too Much to Choose From,4.0,,"Stopped off here for lunch, and the selection was huge, we just didn't know what to have. Settled for Laksa and Chicken rice to share. Was a very busy place popular with locals. Will return on our next trip to Singapore!"
,,Hong Xiang Hainanese Chicken Rice...is the place to go,5.0,,"An amazing eating experience. Don't go too large early on and try and enjoy 2 or 3 different places. This said Hong Xiang was the winner for me. Bit of a wait to get served (15 minutes) but outstanding chicken rice. Order the small portion so you have room to try other things, as this place is a food journey. Tried some noodles in a stall 2 down, but so hot I nearly passed out."
,,Very good food!,5.0,,"The best food in Singapore can be found here! Be it chicken rice, fish soup, minced meat noodles or the peanut rice ball soup etc, you just gonna come and try them all! This is probably one of the best hawker centre in Singapore!"
,,Something for Everyone,4.0,,Great place for lunch. Whatever you do start with an oyster cake then move on from there. My biggest problem was I wanted to stop at too many different stalls and took ages to decide.
,,Best Hainan Chicken Rice,5.0,,"If you asked me to recommend a place for best Hainan Chicken Rice, I would recommend Tin Tin Hainan Chicken Rice at the Maxwell Food Centre. The chicken was made to perfection and the rice was delicious. It's probably the busiest place in the food centre. There's always queue there."
,,Trying To Maintain Traditions,4.0,,"This is a local Singaporean Hawker Food Center with long history. There is a wide variety of choices here for the adventurous and the prices are very reasonable, considering that it is located in the city. Some stalls have been been handed over to the next generation who are trying hard to maintain the old tradition. Some were successful, some not quite getting there. On the whole, it is a good place to visit."
,,Spacious food court,4.0,,The prices here are a bit more compared to tanjong Pagar market food court but all the stalls opens till 9 or so. Alot of choices and great food.
,,One of Singapore's Finest,5.0,,"One of Singapore's oldest and finest hawker centres, Maxwell Hawker Centre is centrally located and is especially popular with the lunch time office crowds. Fans have been known to travel across the island for its Zhen Zhen Porridge (Stall 01-54), Fish Soup and Tian Tian Chicken Rice Stall #01-10) and China Street Fritters (Stall 01-64). There is something for everyone including Indian and Halal food. World famous saxophonist Ernie Watts is known to stop by for Ice-Kacang whenever he's in town."
,,Top rated Hawker Centre,5.0,,"This is mostly famous for the Tian Tian Chicken Rice stall (Stall number 10), which has been highly rated by Anthony Bourdain and many food and travel writers as the Number 1 chicken rice stall in Singapore. Some locals many disagree, but it is definitely quality. There are other chicken rice stalls in the Hawker Centre, if you do not wish to wait in line."
,,Excellent variety,4.0,,"Rough and ready - but clean, cheap and yummy food! Places to sit - not too crowded - bring napkins and finger wipes!"
,,Hawk eye for hawker food,4.0,,"It's hawker food so nothing to get too excited about. But...bring stuffed for less than $10?! Amazing.
I will say I was really underwhelmed with the chicken and rice (and yes we went to Tian Tian). It was super bland do not getting what the hype was about. Juices are cheaper on the street. Sometimes hard to find a table to eat at. Make sure to look for the health grades at each stall!"
,,Tin Tin Hainan Chicken Rice and Fresh Young Coconut,5.0,,"Visited once only and would like to go again for Tin Tin Hainan Chicken Rice! Hainan Chicken Rice is really cheap and I recommend to try the chicken drumstick rice which is only SGD4 or SGD5 but very very delicious!

Can also try to drink young coconut in Maxwell food centre. feel refreshed when you keep sweating in Maxwell...as there is not air conditioner in every food centre in Singapore."
,,Something for everyone,5.0,,"I would highly recommend this place to backpackers. Lot's of options, all for very low prices. The chicken rice is overrated, there are so many better options. Each individual place has it's own cleanliness rating so be aware of the lower rated ones."
,,Great cheap local food,4.0,,"My boyfriend and I ate here several times. It's a typical food hawker with lots of stalls and food to choose from. People were queuing like crazy for the hainanese chicken rice (perhaps one of the best in town). Mostly locals with a few tourists/ expats eating here. The prices are very very reasonable. You can be stuffed and happy for 5 - 10 SGD. Lots of yummy juices as well, I recommend the fresh sugar cane."
,,"Good food, good value.",4.0,,"When I visited, the area around Maxwell Road was being refurbished. It wasn't a hindrance. Unfortunately when I was there, several places were closed for Chinese New Year.

There are countless vendors serving an amalgamation of delicious Asian food. If you want dessert first (try ais kacang), go for it. If you want to try 3 different types of satay, go for it. Oyster omelette? Yep. Bubble tea? Yep. Good old barbecued meat? Of course. Drink vendors were numerous and sold fresh juice, sodas, and some even beer.

For the best experience, look for a vendor that has a line of people waiting, that means it must be good, right? Naturally, you will have to wait.

My main gripe was that the floors were usually slippery which can be dangerous. Signage for where to place your used dishes was not often clear.

Why not try a bit of everything? If you don't like it, just go and buy something else."
,,Interesting but no longer authentic,3.0,,I had been looking forward to visiting but have to say was a bit disappointed. The centre has been modernised which has destroyed the authenticity that I had been told to expect . I spoke to the concierge at our hotel and she agreed that it had lost a lot of character. That said you can still get a tasty meal and it's great for people watching
,,Great choice and value,5.0,,"We ate here three times during our 4 days in Singapore. Great choice and value. Worth queuing for the busy stalls as the locals know where the best food is. Of particular note, Tian Tian chicken rice, and the lovely lady who makes the sweet potato dumplings, the peanut ones are to die for!"
,,two diamonds in the rough,3.0,,"It is sad to admit that most of the first generation hawkers are retiring or sold out to new arrivals from overseas, the younger generation of Singaporeans are not keen to take over some of the old favorite established specialties.
The government has imposed very strict hygiene standards. they are checked regularly and the markets are scrubbed and cleaned constantly
This review is to point out to tourist who wants to experience some of the old fashioned hawker stalls with no air-conditioning comfort.
In most hawker centres now, there is nothing to write home about, it depends on individual taste buds and foodie experiences.
Tetsuya once claimed that Tian Tian Hainanese chicken rice in Maxwell centre measured up to his taste. Others may find that undercooked? Chicken should be perfectly tender but cooked (equivalent to measuring pasta as ""al dente"")
Another stall that has been there for 40+ years is a favourite for the locals, especially Hokkien (or Fu jian province), the ngo hiang kwang chiang (""sausage"" like with some crispy deep fried pieces of ""dumplings or tau foo (soya bean) is to die for. but, that is an acquired taste. Many stalls profess to be the best in their suburbs BUT most of them can't hold a candle to this place!
Try when you are there, for tomorrow is another day!
One thing is certain though, some specialties might not be there but food stalls will always be operating."
,,Hainanese Chicken Rice,5.0,,"The Hainanese Chicken Rice is a must try dishes. A very long queue here but worth it, no doubt at all."
,,Old Fashioned Indoor Market,3.0,,"This is a stroll back in time considering all the really swanky eateries that there are in Singapore - a great tourist place to visit though. I understand that the building is in the process of being updated so that will improve it I think.

You can buy lots of things from fruit drinks to seafood, to fish dishes to soups to rice dishes. All are served in a very simple way and are only suitable for very very casual dining. The food is very cheap to buy and you need to use cash.

It is open during the day and some stalls are closing up by 7pm.

It is definitely worth a look and you will be able to tie it in with a visit to China Town which is almost next door."
,,Authentic Local Food with the Locals,5.0,,"This is the perfect place to eat authentic local food and to beat the high prices in Restaurants and Food Courts. Its not air-conditioned and the decor is very average but the great food makes up for it.
We ate here twice, after recommendation from a friend, during our 4 days in Singapore and thoroughly enjoyed it on both ocassions.
There are so many stalls and we had no idea which one to select. So we decided to pick the ones with the longest queues and the few minutes wait was well worth it. Two dishes and drinks cost around $10.
Its a bit rough - plastic plates and cutlery, its hot but its great food and really cheap"
,,Cheap place to eat in expensive city,4.0,,Found our way to Maxwell Road hawker food centre on the edge of Chinatown. Many of the stands offer similar meals and most are around the $5 - $7 range. Each hawker centre stall has to display hygene rating certificate and nearly all of them had an A or B so overall pretty good. Look for the busy stands as they appear to be better quality.
,,Authentic local food,4.0,,If you crave local food in an authentic Singapore atmosphere without Aircon this is a good place to go. Maxwell food Centre was my lunch place for 3 years and you can find really good tasty meal which isn't a burden to your wallet. So walk around and go to the shop that has the longest line as this shows it has the best food to offer for the locals. Finding a seat can be at rush hours always an issue as places might be taken by putting down tissues. Overall a great experience
,,A good place to sample local cuisine,4.0,,"In order to sample the local cuisine one has to visit the places that locals go and not any high end or fancy restaurants. Singapore has many great food courts or hawker centres where the local hawkers congregate to offer a variety local food.

One such place is Maxwell Road Hawker Centre and you will spoilt for choice from food to drinks. However, one word of advice, do visit there early if you want avoid the crowd.

The local offerings in Maxwell are generally above average thus making it one of the crowds' favorite. The prices are very affordable too. Even some of the hawker stall has its' following. If you are a visitor to Singapore, this place is highly recommended for you have a real taste of Singapore cuisine.

Happy feasting."
,,lots of varieties,3.0,,vast choices to choose from esp local delights but rather unsafe as 2 gang fights recently happened and people will turn to lay pa sat for food instead.
,,Where Singapore delicacies are,5.0,,"Maxwell Food Centre offers varieties of foods. The price is reasonable. People will be able to try yong tau fu, chee chong fun, popiah, rojak, etc. in the same location."
,,"MAXWELL ROAD HAWKER CENTRE, SINGAPORE",4.0,,"This hawker centre has recently been voted as one of the BEST hawker centres in Singapore. It outshines the infamous NEWTON CIRCLE Hawker centre; which currently is on the downhill trend, as there had been too many scam in this Centre! Maxwell Hawker Centre has many very good stalls selling good local fares (Hainan Chicken rice, porridge, curry rice, peanut soup, fish noodle, Ngo Hian........). Both The prices and quality are good, so are the quantity! The location is good too; as it is near the China Town! The best time to visit will be late afternoon, it is cooler then.DO VISIT this ICON. BON APETITE !!!"
,,Excellent stop for the classics. You could spend a full 12 hours trying stuff here!,4.0,,I love Maxwell center. From the Oyster omelettes to carrot cakes to mee siam to onde onde to goreng pisang and char kway teow you can truly find all the classics under one roof. Main attraction has been Tien Tien Chicken rice which is still an awesome standard. The challenge is that the stalls open at very different hours so you could literally stay the whole day chasing each one and making sure you beat the lines.
,,Burp...,5.0,,Food + Price is just amazing! ‚ô• Lots of varieties to choose from. You just have to prepare yourself for a sweaty dining experience as they don't have AC. :P
,,Plenty of choices.,4.0,,This is within walking distance from the main strip in Chinatown. Food is great and cheap. There's rojak and the famous Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken rice. Also drinks like freshly squeezed jouices. Would come back again.
,,Yummy local food,4.0,,"I eat here almost daily for my lunch. Try to go early - around 12 or earlier to get seats. The Tian tian chicken rice and the fish soup at the corner facing URA is always long queue. Others must try - roasted pork, char siew and duck rice and the rojak in the centre row. The raw fish porridge used to have long queue until the recent raw fish saga
Quite a good selection of food at reasonable price. Try to find seats at the front - facing the road as it is more cooling. You will be greeted by a friendly uncle cleaner that not assist you with seat findings but also wish you goodbye after your meal."
,,Love this place!,5.0,,"Fantastic variety of food here - great bbqed meats, yu char kuay, nonya kuehs, foochow oyster cake. Everything here is so good. Love eating here!"
,,So much variety,4.0,,Wow so much variety we were there for lunch so many little food shops to choose from had a lovely lunch will go back next time we are in Singapore it is located in chinatown
,,Go local try something different,5.0,,"I recently took my wife and mother-in-law to Singapore and it was the first time the MIL had been to Asia for a holiday. As she stated she wanted the full local experience we went for dinner at the Maxwell Food Centre.

The food is always delicious but I wasn't sure whether the location may be a little too much, needless to say I was pleasantly surprised by MIL's willingness to try the culture. We ordered Hainanese Chicken rice, some garlic prawns and black pepper chicken. The food was amazing and incredibly cheap all for under $20 plus drinks.

If you are in Asia try the local food you can have Macca's anywhere but the atmosphere in many of these little food courts is uniquely Asian.

It is easy to find and not far from Chinatown so there is always a backup plan close by if you find the Maxwell open air eating a little more than you can handle. I would definitely go back there again food was very good and the service was friendly."
,,need to go there early,3.0,,"the surrounding is under construction, not easy to find. arrived at about 830, quite a no of shops closed, after finished dinner, most shop closed, quite disappointed."
,,"Food ""tasting"" spree",4.0,,"1. Tried Tian Tian Chicken Rice. The chicken was tender but kind of too oily. The rice was just acceptable.
2. Had dumplings from Special Shanghai Tim-Sum - it lived up to its name.
3. China Street Fritters: Four Colours, One Plate - best item we tasted on that day. The so call sausage was one of the tastiest I have ever tried.
4. Oyster Cake - it was not oily and taste not too bad. But the oyster was just ""too tiny to be seen""."
,,Overrun with tourists,3.0,,"I was excited to visit this place (I ate at seven food centres during my stay in Singapore) since I'd seen it on an Anthony Bourdain TV show. The TV show featured a very modest stall staffed by one man. That stall has doubled in size, had at least five people working there, and had completely new signage. The authenticity has presumably dropped, and I wonder if anyone in the food centre was local. The prices were a little higher than other food centres, but the variety of foods was good."
,,Authentic Singapore Experience,5.0,,If you are going to go to one Hawker market -- make it this one. Even my cab driver complimented me on this choice. A very broad range of food options. The vendors were patient with me as a tourist. Food was delicious and very reasonable
,,SATAY,5.0,,"Approaching 7pm, we walk towards the other side of the garden for our dinner. We went to one hawker centers at the back of Gardens by the Bay and ate one of the most famous Malay dishes in Singapore, Satay (must-try dish). It‚Äôs often served in bunches of 10 individual sticks are also sold with a dip made of spicy and sweet peanut sauce, and is usually accompanied with chopped onion, cucumber and Ketupat (Malay rice cakes wrapped in a weaving pattern of coconut leaves). Great Food and well spent dollar for this dish :)"
,,Hot stuff,4.0,,If you can fight the heat and the crowds there are no shortage of rewards here. The food is fresh and full flavoured in a basic outdoor setting and there is plenty to chose from.
,,Good food at affordable rates,5.0,,Our guide recommended us this food joint during one of the tours. The food is pretty good and affordable. Do eat chicken fried rice here along with other options available. Go for the most crowded stalls as they are the famous ones here :)
,,Real food at less than fast food prices.,4.0,,"If you want a sit down restaurant with a cloth napkin and a romantic atmosphere, The Maxwell Road Hawker Centre is Not the place to go.

If you want to eat real Chinese, Singaporean, Malaysian and Korean food, so many choices of dishes that you will be challenged to chose, and get immersed in the local culture, this the place to eat and enjoy.

Suffice it to say, the menu choices are many and the cooking styles are authentic (read : no adjustments , the cooking is for locals). The prices are right (read: $5.00 USD gets you a full meal unless you are a buffet hog).

Don't be put off by the no frills atmosphere, I trust the food vendors here as much as in any restaurant in Singapore that serves the same food at 6 x the price, plus tax and tip."
,,Very Good,5.0,,"This hawker centre has many stalls selling a variety of local food. It can be very busy at times and you need to be prepared to que especially at popular stalls. Always look for ques as this proves the food is good. Prices are very affordable here. There is plenty of seating available and cleaners are always working to clear up after customers. We went here looking for the stall that sells Chicken rice. We were not disappointed,one guy preparing and selling his goods constantly. Apart from the food stalls you can buy soft drinks or local beer. Well worth a visit."
,,So hot,4.0,,The food here is yummy and affordable. There was more oriental food than others but still plenty of choice. It was extremely busy at lunchtime. Unfortunately it is very warm there though compared to other hawker centres.
,,A Good variety of food!,5.0,,Stroll around before deciding where to sit and order your simple though tasty meal. Prices are good and reasonable.
,,Amazing Food- Foodie Heaven,5.0,,"I was taken here by a friend I met while following his foodblog on instagram. We had a mix of everything and tried some delicious food. A real range of Asian cuisines available. So good we went back twice after without my pal. Friendly people serving and all around. We were the only non locals we could see but we were welcomed and felt completely at ease, don't hesitate to go, only around the corner from China Town!!"
,,"Hainanese Curry Rice, Pork Porridge and Fish Soup Noodles.",4.0,,"Some of the must-try are in the centre aisle of this hawker centre! Hainanese Curry Rice with pork chop to die for, Pork Porridge and Fish Soup that you can spot straight away through the queues!"
,,It's said it's the best hawker centre in Singapore,5.0,,"It's a big place with many options. Lots of famous stalls with long lines of hungry people. There is food, deserts, drinks and more. However, not so many options for vegetarians. You will find something, that's for sure, but nothing dedicated to no-meat eaters."
,,A LOCAL FOOD CENTRE,4.0,,"This is a local food centre near China town ., you will get there all local food in very cheap prices , not everyone will eat there as it is full with local people that eat there as the prices are very low but the food is very nice and a lot of places there to eat and drink."
,,Good food cheap price,4.0,,"Maxwell hawker food court is Situated about 1 minute walk from China town and on Maxwell rd on the corner, there are about 40 stalls or more and food ranging from chicken and rice banana fritters. There only one stall that sells banana fritters but they are very good. My fav was th mixed meats and noodles best place to sit is on maxwell street side I think, bit cooler the centre row and back row can be a bit hot. March 2016 it is currently in a building site but still open for business, GOOD TIP look for the line up of locals which will tell you who is the best stalls. Prices we paid $9.50 Sg dollars for mixed meat and rice and 1 mixed meat and noodles and large cups oh lime juice and ice, very cheap compared to restaurants in be area trendy ones with mains at $65.00 or more.
Seating in round plastic tables with 4 fide plastic seats around the table. Some cab drivers will tell you that each hawker centre is he best but we have eaten at most in Singapore and Maxwells is good and cheap with no pestering from stall owners unlike others in the city, Newton circus in one the is full on pester for your dollar and I'd priced for tourists but still a hood night out."
,,Best hainese chicken...,4.0,,"We heard about this place through other travellers so made time to visit. Yes, it is hot and packed but the hainese rice stall with large q was worth it. The rice was just beautiful and flavours amazing."
,,Economical place to eat,5.0,,If you are in the China town area this is an excellent place to eat....but don't bother queuing for the special chicken....it is vastly over rated.
,,Chicken Rice yummm,4.0,,"Great Hawker food, well worth a visit whilst in Singapore.
Reasonably clean & great value for money, huge variety of traditional food, plenty of locals & tourists enjoying a $3 meal.
Must try the Chicken Rice, recommend lining up at the stalls that have the largest queues."
,,"So many choices, so little time.......",5.0,,"One of our hotels during our two week trip to Singapore was near here, so it was just a short stroll away.
Like the other food courts around, there was everything you could want at very reasonable prices and I had to miss many taste opportunities because I was only there for two weeks.
I discovered Laksa and had several at various times.
It got very busy at mealtimes as you might expect, but I always found a table eventually that I could reserve with my packet of tissues, before getting the food.
I would say 'I'll be back' but it's a long way!"
,,Family holiday visit,3.0,,"We ate there when the Chinatown food centre was closed. The food was good, but it seemed to have lost some of it's character and appeal. It might be because of all the works that us going on close to the centre. Will check it out again when I go back."
,,Great Hawker Food,4.0,,"You can almost every local cuisines here with reasonable price. There are a few famous stalls which you will see the long queue. If you have time, do join the queue. if no, other stalls can also satisfy your tummy. I had my cheapest Kopi-C there for only $0.90 at one of the stall. This price you can hardly get at other place. It is thick and taste great for me. Lunch is average $4 and above depends on what you ordered."
,,Food at Maxwell Market,4.0,,"This is a well known food centre patronised by both office workers and tourists.

Tian Tian chicken rice is what most tourists come for as it has been well featured in guidebooks. Whilst it is well known, there are many other interesting stalls in the market. Opposite Tian Tian is an excellent juice stall with one of the best sugar cane juice around. On the other side of the aisle there is a local mochi shop and there is also a peanut pancake stall which are very interesting. Other dishes that you may want to try are fried kuay teow, fried carrot cake, wonton noodles, mee goreng, pork porridge and roast duck rice.

Hope this helps when you visit Singapore. Oh yes, give Newton hawker centre a miss as it is just a tourist trap."
,,Reputation for the best chicken rice in Singapore,5.0,,If you are chasing the best chicken rice in Singapore you can't go past Maxwell Road Hawker Centre. Look for the long queues and you will know the local favourites! Stay away from the meats if you are a pregnant woman. Acquire a palette for the watered down juices. Try it as fresh fruit instead. Turtle stew (???) and other local delicacies on offer.
,,Our eating spot of choice,5.0,,"First thing we do after landing in Singapore, no matter the time of day or night. We all have our top three dishes that we get more tan often. I bet that everyone who goes there regularly does."
,,Cheap tasty food,4.0,,"Eat here! It's fun, cheap and taste good. You have several different small restaurants to eat from. Dishes are of the size that you will survive on one, but also have room to try several if you want. Ate here many times."
,,Over-rated,2.0,,"Went here for the famous chicken & rice.

Stalls are sheltered but open so very hot. The place seemed less than hygenic.

I had the last piece of chicken at my stall, fried with spicy rice. Very average, hardly tasty and certainly not fresh. Also had two Tsing Tao beers, at least they were cold.

The only redeeming feature is that it is so cheap. Food was SGD5.50, beers SGD8.00 each.

In my opinion very over rated and nowhere the Anthony Bourdain hype. There is a lot of street food out there that is much, much better than this."
,,A local's favorite,5.0,,"Very few tourists are here, so if you want some true local cuisine, this is the place to go for anything and everything. Clean restrooms, too! Near one of the large markets in the Chinese section of the city."
,,Awesome hawker food,4.0,,"Minced meat noodles that comes japanese style egg and their scallop broth was even more amazing.

Raw sliced fish with salad was amazing beyond imagination. The porridge was satisfying too.

Chicken rice may be overrated. Heard that few stalls down the long queue one is another authentic one down from the same master. Yet to try."
,,Oldie Goodie,4.0,,"This hawker centre has a long history of housing many stalls with good food.

In fact, there are a couple stalls who have original stall owners since the first days. I have my favourite fish slice beehoon soup stall (#01-77) since my younger days. An absolute must to try if you are there. Maxwell also house the famous Tian Tian Chicken Rice stall which even Gordon Ramsey loves."
,,Great cheap local food,4.0,,Great place for local food - prices range between $2 and $5 for dishes. Cleanliness ratings are displayed above the stalls - be prepared to sweat it out as there are only a few fans around but the food is worth the slight discomfort.
,,Wide variety at very reasonable prices,5.0,,"We ate here twice during our three day stopover. Everything from soup to nuts (including duck, chicken and eggs). In general we trusted the locals and picked stalls that had the longest lines. Almost without exception prices were under $5."
,,Get yourself Some Chicken Rice,5.0,,"This Hawker Centre is one of the best. Get to the Stall with the Biggest Q, that way you know that the Food is Good. We had a lively Chicken Rice, very Tasty."
,,Cheap Food but little inconvenient,3.0,,"Good For -
1. Local Food
2. Trying different South East Asian Cuisines
3. Very Cheap Eating
4. Eating when nearby Chinatown
4. Variety Food
5. Full of locals

Bad for -
1. Non AC/ Very Hot
2. Veg Options
3. Other than Asian food

We tried -
1. Huananese Chicken Rice (Singapore's Local Dish) - GOOD
2. Thai Rice Items
3. Satay"
,,Cheap and delicious,5.0,,"After arriving in Singapore, we headed to Maxwell for food and drinks. We ate at legendary Tian Tian chicken. Such good nourishment for the price! and delicious! Afterwards each of us got a drink at the hawker stalls, which were all under $2.50 SGD. I would go back to try other stalls, like the Hainanese chicken curry stall"
,,Great Hawker Centre,4.0,,Large number of shops and you have to be careful which you select since the food does vary in quality. Encouraging to see locals eating there. Shame there are no longer more hawker centres in Singapore. Chinese food just as good elsewhere in Chinatown.
,,"Chicken Rice, Fish Porridge, Oyster Cakes and the list goes on...",5.0,,This was the first thing we went to after exiting immigration and went back to on the last day of our stay. The food plaza is well maintained and clean. Definitely must visit on a food trip!
,,Best Hawker Food Center,5.0,,"This is a great hawker center where you will get to experience a great variety of food. It's also located within a reasonable distance of public transportation so it is easy to get to. There is ample seating and clean restrooms. If you want to experience the best of Singapore hawker food, this is a must stop."
,,Love their fish soup,4.0,,Overrated chicken rice that you can give a miss. I don't think locals will think it's nice unless you are a tourist. What you can try is their friec fish soup with milk. It's really good. üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
,,Great selection and variety,4.0,,"Two years ago we took a free walking tour of Chinatown and the guide took us through this food court. We stopped at a few stalls and we tried some of the foods. On my own I probably would not have done that. There is a good choice of fresh fruit drinks, Chinese-style dishes, vegetarian food and halal food. We tried the Hainan Chicken and freshly squeezed sugar cane juice. On our recent trip to Singapore we had lunch there and on another day ate dinner. Just look for stalls with a long line-up of (local) customers: a sure sign that the food must be good."
,,Generally good. Reasonable prices. Hot but must-try. Good variety.,4.0,,"A favorite eatery for locals & tourists alike. Wide variety of good food from Chinese cuisine to Indian, Malay foods and street snacks.
Most of the stalls here are above average.
Many are well-endorsed by popular food bloggers, celebrities and even the President.
As a local I do eat there some times and it's generally authentic local stuff. Worth a try!
I enjoyed the Chinatown Fritters with fried beehoon rice vermicelli noodles. The fried tofu, egg slice and beancurd skin roll were crispy and tasty. Noodles were A little oily but quite nice. Only $3. Reasonable. Had eaten this before. The chilli is good as usual. A local favorite stall.
Had the Fuzhou Oyster fried cake. My first time. Wow! I was pleasantly surprised! It was nicely fried, crispy and filled with meat, some shrimp, herbs and ouster. Delicious. $2/piece. Loved it.
The real downer was the popular & famous Tian Tian Hainanese chicken rice. Rip off. Popularized by top celebrity chefs and hosts like Gordon Ramsey and Anthony Bourdain. Disappointed. The taste isn't anything special. It's just good chicken rice how it should taste like but they aren't like the best (to me). It's just how it should be and not wow...
Plus, they definitely rip off tourists. I look fair skinned and spoke in mandarin so the lady possibly thought I was from China. Without asking (even though she could and would) she simply charged me $5 for a plate of chicken rice!! She just keyed into the cash register $5 and took my $5 note.
After I questioned her, chicken rice for $5?? I'm a local! No tourist! Don't cheat me! I know a plate of chicken rice does NOT cost $5! She then sheepishly said, oh some people want $5... I said you didn't even ask - large or small? You just charge me $5 (higher price) cos I look foreign? She then scribbled $3 on the $5 receipt. But she hasn't given me my $2 change until I reminded her... I'm disappointed that they would be out to cheat tourists. I felt distasteful even before eating the food.

Tourist friends, pls tell them directly and do not be cheated. A regular plate of chicken rice in a hawker center does NOT cost $5. It's not a restaurant. No air-conditioning. No service. Don't pay for it! (Unless you want to order large size or top ups with other items. ) be careful!"
,,Incredible Hawker Centre smack in the heat of Chinatown Singapore!!,5.0,,Incredible Hawker Centre smack in the heat of Chinatown Singapore!! I was floored by the quantity of people and food on offer ... I had some Hainanese Chicken Rice and some sat√© ... plus even some Stone beer .... Heaven!!!
,,Delecious treats for every palate,5.0,,"Impossible to leave this place hungry - more likely, you will be bursting and sorry you could not fit more into your belly. There are around 50 stalls, each serving many delicacies - all fresh, all super tasty. Ranging from all Asian cuisines to Arabic and Westerner grills. Fresh and cheap drinks available... Epicurean heaven!"
,,what a feast,5.0,,"This place has everything to eat, if you can find a table great but be prepared to share with others, there are so many stalls here to go get something, don't be afraid to try stuff, it cost so little that if it is not to your liking, go get something else, do yourself a favour, visit here."
,,Mouth watering,4.0,,"So much to choose from. Very form of noodle, rice, soup in one place. Very busy but well serviced and maintained. And close to Chinatown."
,,Great Singapore food,5.0,,"We arrived in the most crowded time at 12:30 PM. As you can read it on the net, you must put something on the chairs to occupy your place. The food selection is huge! They say, you must stand in the longest queue because this is where you get the best food. But be prepared to wait even 30 mins! Though feel free to stand anywhere you like because you will get either way authentic food for a very reasonable price and a good portion!"
,,Good food but long que,3.0,,"Patient is the key word. I have not been back in Singapore for a few years and forgot that you need to que up to get food at every ""hot"" stalls. I went on Saturday lunch around 2pm wanting to try the famous tian tian chicken rice. Got there and walked around spotted the longest que and that was it. I didn't even want to try to join the que. there are several other chicken rice stalls but I am not sure how awesome the one with long que. since I am not a chicken price I ordered from somewhere else with no que and we ate it and it tasted just good. It's a good experience but would probably go somewhere else where you could enjoy the time sitting and eating together rather than standing queuing up and the other one is chopping the table."
,,Traditional Singapore Dining,5.0,,"One of the better rated hawker centres of Singapore in respect of the food, popular with locals on a regular basis, and unlike Lau Pa Sat, its hours reflect more the local community than the tourist one. So it tends to wind down early on weekdays with around half the stalls already being closed by around 8pm, so not the best place for a late night snack. For those new to the concept, visit a hawker stall for a plate of freshly cooked local food for between $3 to $6.

Many of the stalls proudly display their ratings and awards for hygiene and excellence in the production of food, from a number of places, either agencies, etc., so they are keen to clarify their legitimacy in respect of their arts - these are no mere ""barrow boys"". These ""uncles"" and ""aunties"" of Singapore have been feeding the population for a couple of generations now, mostly passing the stalls down to their children. This is some of the finest Singaporean food you will find in the country.

Still operating over the weekend, it's worth noting that only about half the stalls will be open, as the majority of the clientele here are Monday to Friday the office workers. Far less European options here, but in a good way, it's really not the place to go for a burger or a pizza.

Currently the long running construction work for a new MRT station, not due to complete until 2021, is causing access to be restricted to just 2 sides, Maxwell Rd and Kadayanallur St, but the place is not closed!"
,,Maxwell road hawker centre,4.0,,"A must visit to sample the local hawker food of Singapore. Lots of choice of great tasting cheap local food. Try Tian Tian for really good chicken fried rice,you have to wait a while, but well worth it."
,,"Great value, authentic street food",4.0,,"Went here on a wednesday night when they close the road outside the centre, and the stalls fill the pavements, bench tables and seating across the road. Decide what you want and don't be swayed by stallholders shoving menus at you. Sate is excellent and the prawns are huge . Good value for money and well worth a visit."
,,So good!,4.0,,This place is very fun. We went because we saw the Anthony Bourdain episode where he eats here and it did not disappoint! We had the chicken and rice and it was delicious
,,One of the better hawker centre in Singapore,4.0,,"Perfect place for tourists to experience all the food Singapore has to offer.
Maxwell does offer almost everything every tourist should eat, although not the best of the best, it is still a great sample taste of what Singapore has to offer.
Do skip the long line for Tian Tian Hainan Chicken rice as it is mediocre and very hyped up. There are lots of stalls that do offer better chicken rice than Tian Tian.
If it's your first time in singapore, here's a list of thing that you must try.
Hainan chicken rice, Laksa, Hokkien mee, Fish Beehoon, Bak Kut Teh. and for dessert, Ice Kachang, almond pudding and soy pudding. enjoy."
,,"Good value, interesting place",4.0,,"We stayed in Chinatown across from this center. We loved going there & tried a fair bit of the food except for food made from different parts of fish, etc. One soup was so hot we had difficulty eating it but there are many good choices like rice dishes, soups,,thai food and haianese chicken. One vendor sold coconut & peanut pancake slices that were so good I wish I could have them again. prices were so reasonable unlike some of the restaurants we saw. No one in our party of six got an upset stomach from the food and its so busy that food is always fresh."
,,The center of great food,4.0,,"It was a very hot day so we didn't feel much comfortable inside the food centre. However, we found the best chicken rice in town there at a very reasonable price."
,,Good hawker place,3.0,,"Maxwell hawker was one of good hawker place in singapore. This place was easy to reach by bus, you can reach this place by walk from the maxwell bus stop. You can find many booth that sold kind of food and also drinks. Hawker place always give a good price, this is the right place for push your meal budget."
,,Excellent hawker place with two stalls especially recommended,5.0,,"Great hawker centre in intersection Maxwell Rd/South Bridge Rd. Construction work is on going in front, but access is available from Maxwell Rd.

Excellent place to eat good food at affordable prices. Especially recommend 2 stalls:

-Sisaker Thai Food that consistently serves authentic Thai food. The Tom Yam is fantastic. Sisaker is at the north west corner just when entering from Maxwell Rd.

- Chong Pang Huat in one of the central rows (almost behind Sisaket) that serves one of the best barbecued chicken wings we ever had!
See pictures so it's easier to find.
Enjoy!!"
,,A must experience,4.0,,"a great example to experience a local's side to Singapore away from the high end restaurants

wide selection of stalls - most selling the same menu, so its more luck about which one and then grab a seat along huge benches and enjoy

Its cheap, its good value and no risk to received upset stomach.."
,,Good,4.0,,I had chicken rice and some fresh spring rolls. Delicious! It was my second trip to a centre. The other being toward the airport and near the water. Very scenic and more options. Unfortunately cannot remember the name.
,,Best around.,5.0,,"Best chicken rice, middle row stall on the end (not the Anthony Boudain stall)
Great Prata $1.80 for 2 pieces with gravy.
Great Lime Juice too a must every time we come to Singapore.
Best place to eat real Singaporean food.
It can be hot and humid but we try and get a table on the edge of the building as you normally get a bit of a breeze.
Prata is at the muslim food stall on the outside row right up 1 end."
,,Metro Construction,4.0,,Now an Underground Metro are being constructed in front of the Maxwell Food Center. The entrance from South bridge Road is closed. We must enter by the side street. Tian Tian and Ah Tai are still there. But noticeable shorter queue and less visitors. I still enjoy the chicken rice even with additional dust from the construction.
,,Great eats,4.0,,You must go to at least one hawker center in Singapore for the experience and some great food. Maxwell Road Hawker Center is clean and has a variety of food options. It's a great no-nonsense place to eat lunch. I went to Tian Tian to try the Hainanese chicken rice which was cheap and delicious.
,,Maxwell really mixes well,5.0,,An old hawker centre that is filled with variety of food. A small chicken rice war exist here between Tian Tian and Ah Tai and other shops that have been to take advantage of the chicken rice popularity here. The famous tapioca cake stall is usually empty by 2pm. Some long queue exist for porridge and curry rice stalls. This place really has much to offer and it takes more than a day to cover all the ground.
,,Delicious but hot and humid and cheap,4.0,,"I like maxwell for to go food. I seriously cannot eat on premise, the prices are good and the food is very tasty but it's so poorly ventilated. And most of the times its very hot and humid! I highly recommend trying the oyster pancake stall and the famous chicken rice. All very tasty"
,,Amazing yet simple food,5.0,,"Loved this place. We are living in London and had been craving some proper Asian food and we were not disappointed. It's basic to look at but to see how proficient the stall holders worked often on their own to produce such tasty food was brilliant. We had Singapore chicken and rice, mixed plates of dumplings and soups. We had jet lag other wise we would have tried everything. Definitely by-pass china town and check it out."
,,Great place to start your vacation,5.0,,"The hawker market at Chinatown was one of the best locations we had visited during our 4 days trip to Singapore. The atmosphere was just perfect, many hawkers try to offer you a seat or food in a very decent and kind way, nothing like the guys in the Thailand's Kawasan.

And the food was just great.

Tips for newbies:
1. Sit outside on the street.
2. Order a pitcher of Tiger beer.
3. Order 15 pieces of chicken satay.
4. Order napkins from the old guy.

Enjoy your time!"
,,Where else would you want to go?,5.0,,"There's everything here. All the hawker food you could want, many cuisines, most of the vendors masters of their craft. Look for the stalls with queues, the locals know what's best on offer, - follow them. We had beautiful buttery chicken on the Hianese Chicken Rice, I also spotted Black Hokkien Mee, if only I'd had room! I'll be back for that!"
,,Tough for Westerners,3.0,,"Tons of selection and a great example of the food court culture that dominates Singaoore. As a westerner, however, I struggled -- and I'm an adventurous eater! I found most vendors don't speak English at all so it's a bit hard to figure out what's in the various dishes. Some things were obvious but most were not.

Another thing I struggled with was it was HOT outside and sitting in a jam packed food court while its 88 farenheit and humid was not my cup of tea."
,,"Great place for lunch- yes, the chicken rice is all that!",4.0,,"Enjoyed the atmosphere in this Hawker Centre. I saw lots of good looking food stalls, but opted for the Tian Tian famous Chicken Rice, stood in the line (it didn't take very long- very good system). The only thing I regretted was not ordering the chinese greens with oyster sauce to accompany the chicken rice, but the beansprouts were pretty great, too. Got a delicious soursop drink at the beverage place opposite for 1.50.

Afterwards, went across the street to the Red Dot Design museum- a nice gift shop and interesting exhibits of design- worth checking out."
,,"Good Food, Very Cheap",4.0,,"All kinds of food, low prices. The quality is good. Basic clean amenities like chairs and tables, as usual. Clean restrooms. Prices around $5 to $8 per meal. Recommended."
,,Genuine Hawker,5.0,,A must try when in Singapore! Choose between several different dishes and just share with friends at the table.
,,Love this place,5.0,,"Located right next to Chinatown. This place has the winning combination of good and cheap food in a very expensive city. Try the chicken rice here at Tian Tian, you won't be sorry."
,,Good cheap food,5.0,,"Was looking for a cheap lunchtime place to eat, so asked our cab driver to take me and my wife to the best hawker centre in singer, they're all good by the way, got chicken and rice for ¬£2, bargain, great for lunchtimes."
,,The real deal,4.0,,"Maxwell is one of the old original hawker food centres of Singapore. Located right down town just near China Town. Some of these food stalls have been cooking their same fare, handed down through many generations. You can get the real Singapore food here such as Hainan chicken, rojak and popiah. It is the sort of place where you need to pace yourself and sample many dishes. Prices are very reasonable and hygiene seems very good.

After you can stroll around, exploring some old Singapore / Chinese architecture in many nearby streets and you will discover yet more unique eateries for future nights.

A thoroughly rich but inexpensive experience and night."
,,Great experience and delicious food,4.0,,This was our first experience of Hawker Centre dining whilst in Singapore and it was great. Before we visited I was a little intimidated or unsure but needn't have worried. There's plenty of choice from the many stalks/mini shops and the food was delicious. There are also lots of places selling wonderful fresh juices. The centre was clean and tidy and had a great atmosphere.
,,Good variety of food,5.0,,Enjoyed the food there. Went there several times. For $5-$6 you can get a good meal. Make sure you try the fresh fruit drinks. There are so many combinations available and quite inexpensive. Great for the hot Singapore days. Bring your own napkins!
,,One of the the best Food Courts in Singapore,4.0,,"There are many food courts in Singapore and this is one of the best ways to sample the Local specialities at reasonable prices. We consider Maxwell as one of the best places, good choices and easy walk to Chinatown MRT"
,,Best value,5.0,,This may not get the same tourist flow as Lau Pa Sat and the choices are narrower but the locals know where to find the best Hainese Chicken Rice - at the Tian Tian stall here. You will not find a better chicken rice anywhere else regardless of the price which at $3.50 is unbeatable too. I got my sugarcane with sour plum juice at the stall across. There are other options too but I knew what I wanted.
,,Busy and good selection of ethic favourites,3.0,,"The atmosphere is not as good as Lau Pau Sat, but the selection is certainly different. Lots of locals, but missing the traditional feel. I enjoyed everything I ordered, particulary the mutabak."
,,Tasty BBQ Review @ Maxwell Food Centre,4.0,,"Took a 30minutes walk to find this Maxwell Food centre. Decide to come here to try one of the hot favourite Tian Tian Chicken Rice. But too bad it is closed. Tried to go another famous stall, Zhen Zhen porridge, which is also close yesterday.

Decide try another famous stall, stall #94, ""Ye Lai Xiang Tasty Barbeque"". This is the only one of the few with long queue. This is my first time I notice western food with a long queue at hawker centre. Decide to queue for it and took about 20min. I realise they only open from 6pm to 10pm Monday to Friday only, which is super short working hours for a food centre. Well, and that may explain why the rush for a long queue to try this famous western food.

Also I take note that the stall is rated Grade A in term of hygience, which is of the highest standard. Aside from this, there is sign show they are using healthier choice of oil and ingredients. I thought it is just marketing gimmicks, till when I taste their French fries. Wow! Somehow my first time I saw the French fries Is in light yellow colour and they do not put salt in the French fries. Didn't know they put so much focus on health for their consumer. Thumb Up for that!

Of course what is famous is their chicken chop. A little surprise, they provide huge portion of meat. The sauce is uniquely made by them, not the typical pepper or mushroom sauce. It is of a little sweeter than normal. The meat is tender and taste good.

While I was eating yesterday, i'm surprised two tourists asking me where do buy this western dish and I pointed to them the direction and stall #94. I guess the food presentation looks good so they asked.

Also I order sugar cane drink in one of the stall. Sugar cane drink is common in Singapore Hawker centre. Do try it if you are there.

All in all, I'm pleased with the dinner yesterday. Enjoy your meal!"
,,Lots of variety,3.0,,Lots of different foods on offer and cheaply priced. Has a great atmosphere and the smells are wonderful.
,,Authentic street food,5.0,,"Singapore is beautiful and a great place for food.
I highly recommend Maxwell food centre as you can get a great meal
and at a very reasonable price. Compared to resort or hotel restaurants
this place is very very cheap There a many different dishes to choose and you can see the stall holders cooking it and we found the food excellent.
Haianese chicken and my favourite char keow teow was fantastic.
Don't leave Singapore without trying the food at Maxwell food centre."
,,Delicious food!,4.0,,Good place and tasty food . I recommend everyone to visit this plase if you are in Singapore you will not be disappointed ))
,,Not all stalls are nice,4.0,,Avoid going on Monday and Sunday as many stalls not really operating. Food there are relatively food and cheap. Must try: 1. Chicken rice 2. Porridge
,,Essential Singapore,4.0,,"A must-visit for the endless variety of street food. Made-to-order dumplings, fish-head chowder, spicy crab -- it's all here, at modest prices, in a lively atmosphere. You'll know you're in Singapore."
,,Tiantian Hainanese Chicken Rise,4.0,,"Try something different - for me as European it very impressive but a bit scary. Large self-service space with round tables occupied 50/50 locals and tourists, eating all kinds Asian food and paying extremely cheap.
I ordered famous Tiantian Hainanese Chicken Rise ‚Äì I was a bit disappointed with too mild taste.
Go there and get some nice local Asian cuisine and it's better than in expensive places"
,,Local food in one location,4.0,,"This place is good for both tourists and locals. The array of food choices is wide. The stalls that are worth trying- chicken rice, roasted pork ( hk roasted style) noodles, fried banama fritters and fish soup. Thai food stall at the front section is also worth trying. After eating , you can adjorn to club street at the back, where all the bars are..."
,,I love it,5.0,,"For foodies, it's heaven. This is a really nice and unique place in Singapore, where you can find a big variety of Asian, Indian and other food. I highly recommend visitors to go there!!!"
,,Absolutely loved it,5.0,,"Came here on the proposition of the taxi driver when we passed the center the same morning.
We came there after all day shopping to grab a bite, and it was amazing.
Prices? Extremely cheap...for 4 s$ you can choose whatever you want. Very clean and safe!
TIP: Always go for the stores with ques of Singapores, they know where to eat :)
Apparently this was the place where Anthony Bourdain came to learn how to make chicken rice!"
,,A taste of locals!,3.0,,"We went there to try Hainanese chicken rice. Chicken tasted good, but the rice was way too oily and soup was plain. You might need to observe many food stalls before deciding to go to your most interesting one. I really liked pressed fresh fruit juice with ice. You can have a cold cut fruit or juiced one. Price was a little bit reasonable for a budget travellers."
,,You will find tasty local dishes here :),4.0,,Lots of local dishes that are tasty & cheap. Clean place with different stalls. A must visit to have a taste & experience different Asian cuisine that won't break your wallet. Food starts at 4 Singaporean dollars that depends on the size of your order. I recommend carrot cake & oyster omelette.
,,Nice dessert,3.0,,I visited one stall selling dessert made from beans. It was quite nice and very economical. I recommend to have dessert there.
,,So much choice!,5.0,,"A great mix of Asian food at reasonable prices - great for budget travelling in Singapore! My partner and I ordered food and drinks from 3 separate places, which then delivered to the table number. Dragon fruit and pineapple smoothies were great!"
,,Great Price and Reasonable Taste,5.0,,There is a lot of menu each shop on food in Singapore. You can choose what you like. Food court i go is near China town. Taste is cool. You can try Chinese style menu like Chicken Rice.
,,Maxwell hawker center,4.0,,"It was one of the recommended hawker centers in Singapore, so one day we had lunch there. It is a covered place with many food stalls inside. Also because of the write-ups, we tried the Hainese chicken over rice; while there are several stalls that sell this dish, we tried the one from Tian Tian although it had a long line of people. While the food was good, I cannot be sure it is indeed (much) better than the other ones, simply because I did not try them so cannot make a valid comparison. The food center is not materially different from Lau Pa Sat, but I still prefer Newton Circus because you can sit in the open air."
,,So many excellent choices,4.0,,Hainanes chicken and so many other choices. Eat excellent food and mix up with the locals. Never been disappointed with the food here. It's usually made under your eyes so couldn't be more fresh! Enjoy and try something new. Usually the best food is where you find the longest lines of local people.
,,Wonderful street food,4.0,,"Excellent cuisine from number of food stalls...hainanese chicken rice at Tian Tian, pork congee, soya bean desserts, to mention but a few"
,,Great experience...must do in Singapore!,5.0,,"If you like food....you should most definitely make the trip here! Definitely come hungry as they have all kinds of foods (all asian) and you should try as much as you can. We had a samosa, murtabak (my favorite!), Malaysian noodles (can't remember the name), fried sweet potato, beers and an avocado shake. All of it was great and most of all, the experience is pretty cool and authentic. Highly recommend!"
,,Maxwell Food Centre,5.0,,"Maxwell Food Centre is located at the corner of Maxwell Road and South Bridge Road , it is at first floor only. Do not visit the wrong one , as there is another known as Maxwell Road Hawker Centre , it is on the second floor."
,,Maxwell Road Hawker Centre,5.0,,"They just renovated. I recommend Tian Tian Chicken Rice, China Street Fritters, Lao Ban Beancurd, Hoe Kee Congee, Lim Kee Banana Fritters. They are popular food stalls for the local. There is another Maxwell food centre , it is first floor. Do not visit the wrong place. This Maxwell Road Hawker Centre is located at second floor."
,,Hainese chicken,4.0,,"Had the famous Tian Tian steamed chicken rice from the very busy hawker stall and it was really worth the queue. Tender and flavoursome with excellent rice and warm chili and crushed ginger.
As it was coming on New year some stalls aware closed bur the centre had enough table and stalls to make the visit goog and it was vey clean."
,,Must try Hawker Food,4.0,,"If you want to try good food from Singapore try Maxwell Rd. Hawker center. They have a variety of food. I like the thai food, the chicken rice, the fresh juices....atleast try the avocado with a drizzle of chocolate. Also love the potato snacks. It's near the Chinatown and the big offices of Raffles areas. While you are in the area you also need to visit the URA. You will see a scaled model of the whole Singapore in the lobby."
,,Come hungry,5.0,,"It had been along time since I visited Singapore and I couldn't wait to try some hawker food. First problem was finding a hawker centre - luckily Maxwell Road was close by. The second problem arose when we arrived - the size of the servings! When last in Singapore it was possible to order a variety of dishes as the servings were quite small. That way it was possible to try a wide variety of food. This time I was full after a serve of Pohpia! Nevertheless over the course of a few visits I made my way through oyster omelette, chicken rice, nasi lemak and murtabak - washed down with copious ampounys of sugar cane juice."
,,Anything you want,4.0,,We went to Maxwell Food Centre for breakfast. Coffee is a bit different there and the choices for breakfast food are not what we're used to!! It's a great experience and the vendors are very friendly and helpful
,,You can have everything you like!,3.0,,"Comparatively this Hawker Centre are more tourist friendly, almost most of their staff in their stalls can speak English. This is important esp people like me who looks very Chinese but can't understand Chinese. haha!
We walked around the stalls once & find our seats. Let them know your table no. when order food. That's easy, and the most important is.....they are clean and tidy. Great place to visit again."
,,Good and cheap,4.0,,"Opposite the Buddha Tooth Temple ‚Äì open from 11am to 9.00pm ‚Äì eat where the locals eat with lots to choose from at rock bottom prices ‚Äì the overhead fans circulate the warm air so not a place to linger just gobble and go ‚Äì the illuminated signs are not that accurate so hang back and see what others are served before making your choice or chose the popular stalls with queues ‚Äì Rojak, Gyozo (pot stickers), steamed pork dumplings, Hainanese chicken and the guy who sells roast duck with rice and a sticky sauce were my choices."
,,Maxwell food centre singapore,4.0,,"Maxwell food court is a place you must try , It will give you a chance to sample some great food ranging from the Famous Chicken and Rice to Nasi Lemak , BBQ chicken wings , Satay Sticks , Pork Char Sui , Rojak , the list goes on , a must is the Chicken and Rice and I recomend Tian Tian , my favourite 3 foods in Singapore are
Chilli mud Crab , Popiah , Chicken and Rice , if you are a foodie as myself and my wife are try and visit Maxwell it's a must"
,,Excellent,5.0,,"As with all food centers in Singapore, this one is excellent and well-priced. You'll see the lineup for Tiantian Hainanese Chicken but go ahead and find somehwere else to eat as the lineup isn't worth it"
,,Great!,4.0,,"Simple, tasty, huge variety, great location, inexpensive. What else can you ask for? A bit too touristic by now and fans could be better, but other than that a ""must"" spot in Singapore."
,,"Low cost, great food",5.0,,"A bit hard to find, but if you want to eat local cuisine at cheap prices, these food stalls are the best for that. Nothing fancy but the place was packed with locals , so that is all you need to tell you that there is good food there."
,,"Hawker centre , many choices",3.0,,"Currently this hawker centre is surrounded by construction around it and therefore lacking it's usual buzz and atmosphere. Yes, many choices and most stalls rated around 'b' but not as it used to be"
,,Fun experience,5.0,,"We arrived maybe a little to late as there were a lot of stalls shut but there were still plenty serving and with the advice from a great taxi driver we looked for the A,B or C health grading signs in each stall. The A means fantastic and really safe to eat from, the B means pretty good and recommended to eat from, C not so good your taking a bit of a risk and if they don't show an A,B or C don't eat from there!! These are government gradings.
We ate from a few Stalls showing a B and the food was delicious and we certainly didn't get sick.
We met a lovely local man who came to sit with us and chat. It was a great experience trying different local foods with the locals and it was very cheap!
We would definitely go back again next time we visit Singapore"
,,Spoiled for choice,4.0,,"The great advantage of hawker centres is, of course, that you're not bound to one provider; nor can you expect more than plastic cutlery or plastic tables and chairs; nor will you eat alone as you're bound to strike up a conversation with the person whose elbows you just jogged.
Very cheap, very tasty!"
,,Good ol hawker fare,5.0,,Good old hawker fare can be found here at this historical market. Some old stalls are no longer around but overall still have Lotsa famous stalls around. Was spoilt for choicest whenever I am here. Very crowded during lunch time. Breakfast and dinner time not as bad but still as busy.
,,Adrian,5.0,,What a great place to visit for an evening meal lots of locals sitting outside on plastic tables and chairs but the food is to die for I had grilled king prawns followed by beef in black bean sauce with rice washed down with 2 bottles of tiger beer all under 55 Singapore dollars great atmosphere and well worth a visit
,,Go to Tian Tian for the Hainese chicken rice,5.0,,"The best ever chicken rice is Tian Tian. But, be aware that they close when they sell out -- we were there at 4pm and there was no problem. But the next day we went back at 6:30 and we were no longer able to get what we wanted (half a chicken) --"
,,My favourite place in Singapore,5.0,,"This place is just amazing. 40-50 stalls selling food, drinks, fruit and baked goods.

Selection is phenomenal, choose what you want. I stayed 5 days in Singapore, visited this place for lunch every day. I never had a bad meal. And it's cheap too. I just love this place.

Go there, you will not regret.

It's not very far from Singapore City Gallery, also worth a visit."
,,Fantastic place,5.0,,We tried Hainanese Chicken Rice @ Tian Tian. It was very good! The stall opposite sells lovely fresh juices!! Great location to meet people & have authentic food!
,,Must eat here when visiting China Town,4.0,,"Lots of different food stall to choose from and not far from the chinatown markets. It was our first visit and we only lined up for Tian Tian chicken rice stall which was great (will write more in the other review on that).
We will definitely visit again when we come to Singapore"
,,Great choice,4.0,,We come to this place each time we visit Singapore and we've never been disappointed. All the stores we have tried have always served up cheap tasty food and good drinks. The place itself is kept very clean and is always very busy with locals.
,,Fantastic Experience,4.0,,"Eating at a hawkers market, is a must do for those in Singapore!
The Maxwell Singapore is fantastic for tourists and locals alike. You can eat fantastic, authentic, local food that is absolutely delicious and sold at dirt cheap prices. The atmosphere is incredible with hustle bustle and the wafts of delicious food cooking. Chicken Rice is the specialty here but there is a multitude of other fantastic and tasty dishes to try."
,,Foodie paradise,5.0,,"A five minute walk from my hotel, and in the heart of Chinatown, Maxwell road hawker center is a great way to dive headfirst into the Singapore food scene. The highlight (as well as the biggest crowd) is Tian Tian Chicken rice. One of the national dishes of Singapore, chicken rice is a simple, yet elegant dish and who serves it best is highly debated. After that, just follow your nose, you cannot go wrong."
,,Spoilt for choice,5.0,,"During our stay in Singapore, we came here several times. You are guaranteed a quality, fresh meal on a shoestring budget.

There are loads of stalls, so have a good wander before choosing as you're spoilt for choice. Tip: it's worth queuing at Tian Tian for the Hainanese chicken rice; then head to one of the fruit juice stalls for custom-blended juices or fresh pressed sugar can juice.

You'll get a top meal and drink for under 10SGD."
,,Great Choices,4.0,,"Dim Sum, noodles, chicken, fish, fruit and fruit juices something for everyone. Really cheap to eat here. Just wander around until you see something you fancy."
,,Food to suit most palates.,4.0,,"This was just down the road from where we were staying. Not fancy but great choice of stalls offering a good range of food choices. fresh fruit stalls and great fresh juices as well as all the hot food places. Ate here lots of times, never had a bad meal."
,,"Come for the chicken rice, stay for other local delicacies",5.0,,"Maxwell provides an ""authentic"" local hawker center experience, although you will see a fair number of tourists stroll through. The fact is, hawker centers (and their smaller cousins, coffee shops, aka kopitiams), are located across the entire island. Maxwell, however, is located near the center of town, with many tourist hotels nearby, and Anthony Bourdain and many locals say that Tian Tian's chicken rice is the best and therefore a ""must-try."" There are plenty of other savory local foods at Maxwell besides chicken rice, however -- I would come back to Maxwell multiple times if staying nearby and try to sample as many as possible. Many stalls may not be open at night and are more likely open during the day on a weekday.

Lines can be long at Tian Tian (but not always). Try Ah Tian, which was founded by a former Tian Tian chef. Is one really better than the other? Hard to tell, but many people have differing opinions."
,,Locals' favourite eating place.,3.0,,"You must come before 12pm. Hot and very crowded. Near constructions, train station in the future. Many choices. Food is cheap."
,,Try coconut pancake for desert!,4.0,,"Maxwell food court is probably the only hawker center in Singapore with unique combination of advantages. It is centrally located and easily accessible, it is next to several interesting sites, it is frequented by locals and the food is tasty and relatively inexpensive for the location.

As far as what to eat, the same principle works - if you see a line, then the food/stall is popular and you won't be disappointed. However, it worth to mention that during lunch breaks and on weekends wait time to popular stalls can be 30 min and more. Best time for visit would be around 11AM when stalls are prepared to deal with lunch crowds, yet they are not there yet.

I would give one recommendation for desert - at the middle of the first row (where at the end restrooms are located) is a stall which sells only pancakes. And the one with shredded coconut fillings is do die for. But make sure that you watch you waistline. :)"
,,Delicious chicken rice,4.0,,There's one stall that sell chicken rice which is very crowded and get a long Q. I forgot the name but it was very delicious and worth to try.
,,Cheerful and busy place,4.0,,"Huge choice of food here. Tricky to get a table but people don't seem to mind sharing. Biggest queues at one of the Hainanese chicken stalls, cheapest rainbow jelly dessert - 50c - at the fresh fruit stall. Had a couple of them. Nice steamed gyoza. Must be a good place to eat as it was packed with locals."
,,Cheap n good,5.0,,"This is definitely one of the top 3 hawker centre's in singapore. There are so many good stalls there, for eg the chicken rice, fish soup, porridge, fried fritters and tapioca cake are all Singaporean cuisine to die for.

Parking is still a problem there now that they closed the public car park for construction. The closest public car park now is the ura car park."
,,A Good Cheap Place to Eat,4.0,,This really is a great place to eat with the locals. Far from fine dining but really good freshly prepared food. Better and cheaper than most nearby restaurants
,,Meepok and chicken rice and plenty of others,4.0,,A well regarded foodcourt by the locals. It is very busy on weekends and during meal times especially the chicken rice stalls and the meepok (thin flat noodle) store. One of the chicken rice stalls would have a wait line that is not uncommon to go outside of the foodcourt but plenty of other stalls to try. I really recommend the meepok stall but it only open certain hours and again be prepared to wait.
,,Varieties,4.0,,"A good place to get congee; fish, chicken and even frogs' legs. Also good for fritters ( YU Tiao). Good dessert stalls selling soya bean curd n soya bean drinks etc. Fresh fruit juices are also plentiful n really fresh."
,,Ideal Market Food,5.0,,"Just been through Chinatown and walked over the road into food hawker heaven. The smell of the food, the chatter of the people, the variety that was on offer. You have to walk all through the centre to get an idea of what is on offer before you try anything as you will miss out if you just eat the first thing you see. You will not be disappointed. The food is safe as it is inspected regularly by Singapore authorities and really happy with the food I got."
,,"Cheap, delicious food.",4.0,,"Food Heaven!
This place offers many many different variety of local delights. Which all of them are extremely affordable and delicious.
During lunch hours, finding a seat could be difficult though. Make sure your accompany saves you a spot. Or if you travel single, don't afraid to ask to share a table with others."
,,Traditional and modern local kitchen,3.0,,"U wanna experience something different? Me as an European got a blast on local cuisine. People all over the place, food made fresh ""not sure how long an egg can survive in 35 degrees Celsius without being chilled, but the stacks were properly displayed ;)""

Go there and get some nice local Asian cuisine and it's better than an expensive journey throughout Asia ;)"
,,Great food,4.0,,Had the famous chicken rice at tien tien. All it was hyped up to be. Fragrant and moist chicken on deliciously flavoured rice. Be prepared to line up. Environment not as intense as at other hawker markets. Will be back again
,,Foodies' haven.,4.0,,"- In the heart of Chinatown, across the road from the Budha Tooth Relic Temple.
- Easily accessible by bus or MRT (Tanjong Pagar, Chinatown stations)
- Maxwell MRT station construction under way (to take a few years), expect some inconvenience in the vicinity
- Long lines at popular stalls between noon and 2pm on weekdays.
- Recommended eats: chicken rice, fish soup, and lots more.
- Nearby accommodation incl. boutique hotels at Ann Siang Hill/Club Street, Erskine Road and inns along South Bridge Road

- You can purchase Lomography gear from the official store along South Bridge Road, about 50m from here."
,,hawker street food at its best,5.0,,great street food. was bustling when i visited. its a lovely place to have a decent take away without going away! Very good food variety and really abuzz. Its the perfect place to try out other dishes you would otherwise not normally have and you can see the different dishes as you order. Dont fooled by first impressions. city workers and bankers were mingling with insurance brokers here as well as us tourists! fabulous atmosphere.
,,Top Value!,4.0,,"We‚Äôve enjoyed many visits to Maxwell Markets over the years! This time we revisited Sisaket, one of our favourite locations for authentic, tasty Thai food, at incredibly affordable prices.

We ordered three dishes: Green Mango Salad, Spicy Fried Kway Tiao and Seafood Phad Thai... and I scored a can of Tiger Beer a few stalls away. Total cost of our feast? Less than $15.00, with the Singapore dollar right on par with the Ozbuck!

Great value for your tourist / traveller dollar... .

Tip: We noted a review re a TA member having been ill after eating chicken wings at Maxwell Markets. We're surprised. After eating scores of meals at the Markets during countless visits over the past thirty years, neither of us has _ever_ been ill after dining there... and we're fairly fussy about our food. Unlucky experience by another traveller, I guess. Can definitely highly recommend Sisaket Thai to travellers!"
,,chicken rice,4.0,,"This was a great change of pace, cheap eats! The majority of people will be queued up at the blue fronted chicken rice outlet, the food was nice. There is quite a wide selection of food and drinks and we would go back"
,,Cheap and Cheerful.,4.0,,"Visiting Singapore's Chinatown, the Maxwell Road hawker centre is well-worth a visit for a wide range of tasty, inexpensive food.

Like all the hawker centres it can get busy but the turnover at tables is quick and, in any event, when you find an empty table, a packet of tissues placed there will ensure the empty table remains so while you are choosing your meal.

The Maxwell Road centre although absolutely fine, is not too far from Lau Pa Sat, which we preferred slightly, if only for its architecture and the fact that it seems somewhat bigger."
,,Food Poisoning Nightmare,1.0,,"I got horrible salmonella food poisoning from eating chicken wings here. We arrived at 8 pm, and although the Centre is open until 10 pm, half of the food shops were closed (first red flag). We got chicken wings, which looked pre-cooked but were reheated when we ordered them (second red flag). I ate most of them, my husband ate a bit. I got terrible food poisoning several hours later and had to be hospitalized. My husband was sick, but not to the same extent (probably because he ate less than me). So, word to the wise, if you go here, I'd suggest going earlier in the day when the food is more fresh. As for me, you couldn't pay me enough to go back."
,,Foodie haven.,4.0,,"- In the heart of Chinatown, across the road from he Budha Tooth Relic Temple.
- Easily accessible by bus or MRT (Tanjong Pagar, Chinatown stations)
- Maxwell MRT station construction under way, to be operational in a couple of years, expect some inconvenience in the vicinity.
- Long lines at popular stalls between noon and 2pm on weekdays.
- Recommended eats: chicken rice, fish soup, and lots more.
- Nearby attractions: Chinatown, Red Dot Design Museum, URA City Gallery"
,,Cheap and Yummy Lunch,4.0,,"A great place to eat close to China Town. The three of us had lunch and icy cold drinks for under $20. Lots of food choices, we must have walked around at least three times before we made our choices. It does get full and you may have to share a table but it is worth it."
,,Yummy food here,5.0,,You must try the Tian Tian Chicken rice and the Poh Piah. We tried all that was recommended in the website but these two are our favourites. They are the best my wife and I have ever tasted. I am glad to have come here as these are genuine Singaporean food and it is cheap. Look for stalls with queues. They are usually the good ones. They are also worth the wait. The only negative is the place is quite hot. I wish they insulate the roof as you can feel heat radiating from it.
,,"Delicious Food, Great Experience, Very Cheap",5.0,,"We visited here every night whilst in Singapore as it was highly recommended by locals we met, the choice is great, food is wonderful and the price was very cheap. This a food hall though not a restaurant, its fast food hawker style."
,,Try the Chicken rice,5.0,,We were talking to some locals about the best foods to try...they all recommended the chicken rice...we were not disappointed it was as good as the locals said it would be. well worth the wait.
,,Great Thai food.,4.0,,Fantastic Thai food stall also try the chicken rice and oyster cakes. Would recommend that you get there early as tables are taken very fast.
,,my 5 star goes to all hawkers center in singapore,5.0,,"I observe that the hawkers centre has alot to offer. from starter, main course to dessert. U can have it all in every hawker centre. My favourite,fishball noodle, Mee Poh, fried Prawn noodle. Nasi lemak, Nasi Padang,."
,,Where the locals go ...,4.0,,"If you believe the adage 'eat where the locals eat' then this place is for you. Easy to find in the Chinatown precinct, there is a dazzling array of hawker food available. The famous Hainanese Chicken Rice is an obvious choice, except the queues are very long for this dish, so take your pick from what must be 100 other stalls - you won't go wrong. At 11:30 am, it was still possible to get a seat at one of the tables, but come lunchtime and the locals really invaded the centre.
As well as tasty food, you can start feeling a bit local yourself here as you mix with Singaporean families, office workers, labourers and a few tourists all tucking into delicious hawker food."
,,There are some Gems here.,5.0,,"Among the many great things about Singapore, its food obsession may be the greatest. The ultimate expression is the Hawker Centers. In the typical Singaporean fashion, they took the vibrant, street food vendors that naturally developed and required them to meet sanitary standards, but the government also provided them great public centers (like food courts) which became popular attractions. The vendors are referred to as Hawkers. They typically specialize in a few or even a single dish. This results in some who have refined the quality of their offerings to world-class standards at very, very affordable prices.

We only had time for one visit to a Hawker Center, so we chose Maxwell Street Food Center, which houses the Hainanese Chicken Rice Hawker made famous by Bourdain. Since Tin Tin is closed on Mondays, and several locals told us that there were better, we chose the one with the longest line. Ah Tai turned out to be the cook who worked for Tin Tin and opened his own place. It was absolutely heavenly. None I've had before, whether Hainanese, Thai, Vietnamese, or Malaysian versions could compare. It was moist, tender and bursting with rich flavor.

The other dish we had to try was the Hainanese Curry. They start with a mound of rice covered with a rich, spicy curry sauce and you chose the items that you want added from over a dozen deliciously prepared items. I opted for squid, shrimp, and eggplant. We loved this concoction. Amazingly delicious.

Each of these were only $5 Singaporean and one of our most memorable meals of our lives."
,,Definitely worth it!,5.0,,I have never tried the chicken rice here before since it is always a long queue. However I like the teochew porridge and the beef noodles! It sure warms the heart while having it!
,,Great Street food off the Street,4.0,,The Hawker center is at first glance just a large food hall. After eating there I can tell you it is anything else. Each stand specializes in a different kind of food. The cooking area's are clean but very small. The food that comes out is OUTSTANDING. Don't be put off by the first impression. Be adventurous and try things you would never consider. You may find you really like it.
,,Plenty of delicious food,4.0,,"Many stalls with really good food. You will be spoilt for choice. Chicken rice, porridge, tapioca cake, peanut pancake, etc. However it is always crowded so best to go early (before lunch time) as some stalls open from early morning and food would run out by 12."
,,Good food but not enough seat,4.0,,"Many variety of food on this place, but very difficult for us to sit because all is full especiallyy lunch time. So i always prefer take away if i am there"
,,Great BBQ; recommended on 2nd/3rd day of visit,4.0,,"This was our first stop on a first visit to Singapore after an overnight flight and dropping our bags at the hotel, at around 1.30pm.
I wouldnt recommend this as it was hot and busy and quite overwhelming.... but after a few days in Singapore, or a slightly later time, it would have been great...
After seeing the queues at the chicken rice stall we opted for the smaller queue at the BBQ meat stall.
The server predicted I would ask for duck (must be a tourist thing) but I surprised him by also asking for roast pork! Both were very tasty and you get lots of sauce with very fresh cucumber.
Servings are fairly small but all you need in the Singapore heat. Its very cheap.
While not pristine, the premises seemed relatively clean.
To answer the question most novices would have about eating here -there were no 'after-affects'!"
,,Good Food but crowded,3.0,,"Generally the food are pretty good but it is very crowded during lunch time and it is not easy to find seats. During the night, most of the nice stalls are closed. So go early during lunch."
,,Many Good Options,4.0,,Located just outside Chinatown this complex of food stalls has many delicious Chinese and Singaporean food options to choose from at reasonable prices.
,,Best of Singapore's favourite dishes under one roof,5.0,,"Just come here, you wont regret it. Great variety of local foods, most of relatively high standard. I'm a Singaporean and a foodie myself and I come here regularly. Notable to mention and unique to Maxwell is the Fried Sweet Potato Balls, still made the traditional way by hand which is mashed sweet potato and fried with no batter, and with fillings of you choice like coconut or peanuts or vegetables. A must try as it cannot be found anywhere in Singapore anymore and sells out quickly. They open only after 3:30pm though, maybe due to the laborious preparation.
For tourists, Maxwell is a great way to sample all kinds local food across our diffirent ethnic groups (chinese, malay, indian)."
,,Enjoy chicken rice,4.0,,"I went to maxwell hawker center and try the famous tian tian chicken rice.. After long queue finally we can taste the chicken rice.. For me the taste is just avarage but a lot of people love it.. I will try another food next time.. The choices is a lot..

The maxwell hawker centre itself is good.. The variety of foods and drinks are a lot.. Good to try when you go to singapore"
,,Still has the old time charm,5.0,,"This place feels the same as it did 20 years ago. A bit less stuffy and less hot than before. The poh piah stall still packs a mean poh piah. Skin, sauce on the skin, lettuce and then the stewed vegetables. Tian Tian chicken rice is still very good although it would be better if it did not cost so much. Overall a great place to go with the family. Pick a non peak time like before 11 am or around 3 pm for a more enjoyable experience."
,,Some good food stalls and good choice,4.0,,"Must try
- ham cheen peng (not open all the time)
- banana and yam fritters (the famous one)
- chicken rice (Ah Tai, the cook from the other 'famous' stall, not the famous one)

Can try if you have time
- hainanese curry rice
- duck rice (the one with the long queues)

Ventilation is quite poor so wear simple t-shirt and shorts
Drop by the URA Centre across the road to see the free exhibits on the ground floor (called 1st floor) and level 2 City Gallery to cool down and also cos the exhibits themselves are quite interesting"
,,Plenty of good meal options here,4.0,,One of my favourite places to visit when in Singapore. Many good options here especially the Hainanese chicken rice. Better to go slightly off peak hours as it is difficult to get a seat & the lines can be long for the best places.
,,Convenient and delicious choice,4.0,,"After an afternoon walking China town, MAxwell is a good stop over for a quick bite and a taste of Singapores famous dishes."
,,Tasty Chicken Rice,4.0,,"We ate at ""Hong Xiang hainanese Chicken Rice"". Couple which serving us was very adept at serviong, but because of lunchtime hours we waited for almost an hour, but it was worth it!

Chicken which is cooked from inside out (we were told like so:) and than freezed in ice was definitily good."
,,Local eat,4.0,,"A hawker centre that offers many local food from fishball noodles, hokkien mee, prwan mee, fired carrot cake, fried oyster omelette, friend oyster pancake(MUST TRY), to kopi o / teh o , kopi/ tea, kopi/ tea siew dai, kopi/tea gai-dai, teh c ping. It is located just opposite the Buddha tooth relic temple, short walk from china town and many hostel. Worth a visit"
,,Quite Sunday,3.0,,We went to maxwell hawker centre with my family it was a Sunday evening I was disappointed it was very quite and lots of places seemed closed.However the food was the best. We had there famous chicken rice which there was a long que as I had been told but well worth it.also the Hong Kong noodles and other dishes we had all good.
,,limited muslim food options,3.0,,"Out of about 100 stalls only 4 in one corner serve halal or muslim food and only two open at time of two visits in evening and morning. The lamb stew was excellent, but the roti prata was precooked and reheated."
,,Decent hawker food center,4.0,,"Must try will be the chicken rice and fish soup. When u see the long queues, u will know...try to avoid the lunch time crowds from 1130-2pm. Price also reasonable cheap about $5. Must chop seats so need to bring tissue to reserve. Actually they are alot of foods there..so pls try. Must go hawker center..and u can walk across the road to chinatown food center after Buddha temple."
,,Most visited,5.0,,"I visit this hawker centre few times a week for my lunch. It is in my top 5 favourite. Love the Fuzhou Oyster Cake. Rare to find it elsewhere. Other favourites are Tian Tian Chicken Rice, Juice stall opp Tian Tian, Ngoh Hiang stall and Ondeh Ondeh stall. A very good choice for lunch."
,,Gastronomy- Satiety -Affordability,4.0,,"Location: Few minutes walk from Chinatown Smith Street
I got so excited when we visited this food center seeing so many food choices, it took time for us to decide really which food stall to choose,everything was there like a complete package with variety of choices at very affordable price. I found it a bit cheaper than in Food Street comparing fresh juices for eg.- 1:2 dollars, mains 6:8 dollars.
Tip:1. Choosing with so many choices is stressful-try to explore in a fast pace manner the food stalls,I would definitely recommend to try Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken rice, Roasted-expect to que if going during lunchtime specially on weekdays: be sure to bring a buddy. One to fall in line to order and the other one to find a table."
,,Good briyani at the end of the row!,3.0,,Muslim and halal food prepared by the Indian stalls. The briyani is good with full plate rice. For4.50. There are other nice vendors as well. Hot place though even at night
,,OK,3.0,,"It's a hawker centre where you can find a variety of food, from chicken rice to dessert. There's a famous chicken rice stall where you can always find people queuing. I tried it, and well, it's ok. Not very special if you've tried something similar in Malaysia."
,,Very very singaporean,5.0,,"This place is the soul and heart of every singaporean. You eat in the hot tropical heat with a bowl of spicy hot laksa, or a bowl of healthy fish slice soup with rice.
Located there are many different types of food, of which many are top quality."
,,One of Singapore favourite hawker Centre,4.0,,"Maxwell Road Hawker Centre is one of the famous hawker Center in Singapore with large selection of nice varieties . For Tourists, I recommend them to Newton Hawker as it's cleaner and more airy."
,,Supper at Maxwell,4.0,,"Anyone who has spent a night trolling the dance clubs around Tanjong Pagar or the pubs anywhere in town will have eaten at least a supper once at Maxwell Road Hawker Centre. There's variety and quality at affordable prices, and the central location on the edge of Chinatown is hard to beat. My favourites here are the Teochew porridge stall run by the same family for years. They serve very traditional porridge and several side dishes. For drinks, freshly pressed sugar cane juice is among the best. There are several stalls selling the drink, along with local coffee, teas and soya milk. Some of the older shops have been replaced with new ones, but the convenience still draws office workers around the area during lunch and clabbers after midnight until the wee hours."
,,awesome variety,5.0,,"one of my favourite hawker centres in Singapore! the variety of food available is amazing, you'd have to keep coming back to try everything!"
,,Too much choice,2.0,,Lots and lots of choice here in fact too much. Also an lot of repeat food choices. Some confusion due to roadworks on the corner at the moment so would avoid for a while. Good value for money if you make the right choice.
,,Delicious chicken rice at Tian Tian Hainanese,4.0,,"Opposite of Singapore City Gallery, we have found Chicken rice Tian Tian Hainanese at Maxell Hawkers center. Many people were on the queue to order but all were in patience. Firstly we were surprised but after tasting chicken rice, we all agreed that it was worth to wait and to taste it. So delicious and value money, indeed!"
,,Very hot but lots of food to choose from,3.0,,"A very old time favourite, lots of different cuisine, try the fresh sugar cane juice with lemon or sour plum, delicious! Pity that it is so hot to eat there and the construction work ongoing now is not helping."
,,Good local food & cheap,5.0,,Local Singapore food.....A Must try the chicken rice and the Fish Soup ....they are the best at Maxwell Rd Hawker centre.
,,good food at reasonable price,4.0,,"I have read reviews about this food centre and each has own fav food here.
I can say that the attraction of this place is that the standard of food sold here is much higher on average compared to other food centres.
There is not one stall that sells exceptional food, in my opinion.

For the average tourist, this is a good place to sample a wide variety of local fares."
,,Best Hainese Chicken Rice in Singapore,4.0,,And my favourite black pepper beef. Always busy and often missed by those visiting china town. Make a point of going.
,,Cheap and good hawker food in the city !,5.0,,"Famous for their Chicken Rice. There will always be a long Q in front of Tian Tian Chicken Rice but you can always buy from any other chicken rice stall.
The roasted meats stall is superb with good food and service , can be found in the middle aisle with a green signboard.
This hawker centre is open for breakfast and lunch .... for dinner time, some of the stalls will close and less choices available.
I also love the China street rickshaw noodles that is open from 6 am to 2 pm - located near the toilets . Traditional simple fare."
,,Large Hawker Centre near Chinatown,3.0,,"While staying at The Scarlet Hotel, I walked through since it is only a stones throw away ... but I didn't eat. This is one of the larger Hawker Centres around however ... so, I'm sure that they have the food of your dreams.

I don't normally eat at the hawker centres much any more. It is inexpensive, sometimes good, etc, but I prefer to sit down and view a menu.

In this latter regard ... Club Street is nearby."
,,Just standard Hawker Centre,3.0,,"Although many peoples in this Hawker Centre, nothing special in terms of price, taste and variety of stores. In Singapore, lots od Hawker Centre are available nationwide
thus it is recommendable to visitmany centres as much as possible.
I am sure you can find your favorite centres and foods rather than Maxwell one."
,,So much variety and the best Chicken Rice Shop!,5.0,,"There's so many things to eat here and luckily not everything was huge portion. We were spoilt for choice. There's a Chicken Rice shop that was a Hawker Heroes winner, apparently in competition with Gordon Ramsay or some other celebrity chef and won! And it was really the best Chicken Rice I've tasted in Singapore!"
,,The catonese barbecued meats stall is superb.,4.0,,"Excellent roast duck, char siew n roast pork belly. Portions are larger then other stalls elsewhere n they even have wanton noodles. Very friendly owner n staff too."
,,Vibrant and tasty,5.0,,"At first it can be a bit overwhelming to see all of the food options and diners, but just relax and settle in and this will be one of the funnest food experiences you can have in Singapore. The Variety of tastes that you can try means you will need to pace yourself, or come back and visit again."
,,Hawker with many good food,4.0,,"Many good food can be found here.

Porridge, chicken rice, fish soup porridge, fried hum ci pang are the must try when you are there.

As for chicken rice, personally I find Tian Tian chicken rice standard drop as I heard the master chef has left due to fall out with the partner and he opened another store near it. Sorry that I can't remember the name of the new store but I'm sure that Tian Tian is riding on their old reputation.

Worth going there for a one stop tasting of Asian local food. Should fill you up there after ordering 3-4 difference nice dishes!"
,,Good Price at CBD Area,4.0,,The nearest place I had my lunch and not so crowded compare to Amoy street. There are a few stalls that I visited often for lunch. A good choice and not so expensive at CBD area.
,,What a buzz,5.0,,"I loved it. Such a great atmosphere! It felt that this was a long established place with many different food stalls. Many people were eating with relish We went back and tasted a variety of the dishes, The real thing!"
,,Wonderful,5.0,,Went here for our evening meal and it was so cheap and fantastic. My favourite is the Chicken and Rice. Yummo. There are so many choices you could eat there for a week and not spend too much. Loved it and will definitely go back.
,,Great Hawker food with great price,4.0,,"The food court has lot of food choices, from chicken with rice, congee, fresh fruit juice, fresh coconut juice, Indian and Thai food. Be prepare to line up for some of the popular food stalls."
,,So much more potential,3.0,,The great thing is that the the dishes are based on authentic recipes with history behind them and how they came to be. The sad thing for me is that they use so much MSG in today's culture (something that didn't exist 100 years ago) to try and make their dishes tasty and trick your brain into thinking the food is good rather than focusing on the real ingredients to bring out the flavor. MSG makes me so sick i just don't eat out in these places unless I know they are MSG free.
,,Great food exploration,5.0,,I like to visit this place at least once a week. Lots of good food here. Most of them are local cuisine. Centrally located opposite the Tooth Relics Temple. Lots of variety of foods here.
,,"Great food, great prices!",5.0,,"My wife and I heard about this place and just had to go and try it out, we went there around 11:30 am and got in line at a popular chicken place where Anthony Bourdain, host of The Layover ate and we were very pleased with the whole experience. 1st of all, like the rest of Singapore, it is very clean there and well organized with lots of tasty food to choose from. We had lunch at one stall and coffee from another. The place got quite busy with locals at 12 noon, so you might wanna arrive a bit earlier. If i lived near there, I would definitely go and eat there frequently. Very good food at very reasonable prices."
,,Great Hawker Centre,4.0,,"A must visit, actually all should be a must visit. This one in Chinatown and convenient after visiting temples Very friendly stall holders"
,,Truly incredible food experience,5.0,,Four of us came here for lunch and we were rather overwhelmed by the range of food on offer. Meals cost $5 or less and each dish we tried proved to be excellent quality and value. The ambience is excellent. I could not fault this experience.
,,Really unique experience,5.0,,We really enjoyed our visit to Maxwell Road Hawker Centre. Food was delicious and unique. One thing we learned is there are ratings for the various Hawkers with A being the very best.
,,We went for the famous chicken rice at TianTian.,3.0,,"Compared with the chicken rice taken in Malaysia, I think the chicken, while tender, is only average. The rice is excellent though. The place is clean, ventilation is good even without air conditioning. There is always a long queue lining up."
,,Hawker streets in Singapore,5.0,,"Hawker centres really are the locals epicentre of all that is traditional singaporean cuisine. the cheapest way to experience a stand up style degustation of the local delights. these food stalls are your eat and run style venue between the shop til you drop detours along the way, each hawker stall serves different specialties with beers to compliment and wash the food down. the smells of chicken rice, yakatori & nasi goreng will leave you satiated."
,,Affordable and easy to find,4.0,,"This is a fantastic food court. Mostly Chinese cuisine, right next to Chinatown. Affordable meals available from dozens of vendors.

I was impressed with the excellent service and excellent quality of the wares at Juice Farm, a vendor right in the middle of the complex.

The only drawback is that there is no air conditioning, so there is no respite from the Singapore heat and humidity.

All things considered, it's worth going to! I recommend it."
,,Singapore's culinary image,5.0,,"A great experience for someone coming from Europe, where the closest to it is a shopping center's food court. If you are after the real taste of Singapore, this is one of the places to go. Dozens of tables surrounded by as many stalls, each serving different food and specialties. Worth mentioning the legendary chicken rice, poppiah, and of course delicious sugar cane juice."
,,Eat like locals do - it's really not expensive and you get variety for good clean food!,5.0,,"many hawker centers in Singapore- thats uniquely Singapore. what's good? Maxwell is one. It is one of the oldest but most established. Food is clean so don't worry- the ministry of health checks all the time. You can see the A to D grading being displayed- it's compulsory. But D when tasty still gets a long queue. D gradin Singapore probably is better than most As in the surrounding emerging markets ( I can testify).

Try Chicken rice, fried prawn fritters ... Just follow where the queue is. The hawkers speak English or Chiinese or ask others in the queue what to order. They don't cheat so you don't worry. Average Sgd 3-5 per dish. Seafood of course more expensive, ask first! Local beers Sgd6-8 per large bottle, depends on location. don't expect service as some are self service or quote your table no if they serve.
,
There are many other such hawker centers eg. Newton, old Airport, people's park, Tiong Bahru, Bukit Merah, Beach Road, all good and my favorites! Same guidance as above, except Newton is more touristy and expensive. Ask the taxi drivers they know best."
,,A foodie's paradise!,4.0,,"Here at the Maxwell Road Hawker Centre, you can find many familiar local dishes at reasonable price. On various occasions I have tried the Chicken rice, poh piah, goreng pisang and fried potatoes, char keow teow and many other dishes I have forgotten.
It is very had to find a table during the lunch time, so it is probably better to go just before the lunch time crowds decend on the centre.

It gets very hot too in the middle of the day, so it is better to go early. Don't expect silver service - it is a hawker centre, all self service."
,,Great Food 3 bucks.,5.0,,"Dozens of food stalls to choose from. I liked the beverage stall with fresh squeezed everything for S$1.60.. Look for a stall with a line..the locals know, right?"
,,Fantastic experience with locals,5.0,,"This was the highlight of my visit to Singapore. We got to experience real food, great beer and in the company of the friendly locals who invite you to eat with them at the tables in the centre. It is a must if you love hawker food."
,,Good cheap local food,4.0,,"Recommended by friends who had been here before us. Didn't disappoint. Large selection of different local food stalls all at backpacker friendly prices. Hainese chicken fried rice and laksa type dish were both lovely. Tables, chairs and bathrooms basic but adequate for quick lunch."
,,Fantastic experience,5.0,,"This is an amazing place to visit, there is so much food to see and choose from here.
It is an amazing place to get a feel for all different types of food. We got a few dishes and sharing them between us was fabulous to be able to taste so many things..
Been there before and it is still so good...Will return again it's great fun.xx"
,,Good place for cheap local food....,3.0,,"This is one of the few hawker/food centres located within Chinatown area. The others are at 2nd floor Chinatown Complex, Hong Lim Complex & People's Park Complex.

Chinatown Complex is the biggest, a huge place & huge varieties.

At Maxwell Centre , there are at least 4 Chicken rice stalls in the same middle section of the hawker centre- the most famous & popular is Tian Tian. Queue here is constant & long, whereas there are no queues at the others.

There are other good food stalls here as well. But this place is not very big & types of food are also limited

Personally preferred Chinatown Complex food centre ( just 2 mins walk across the road from here) . Being much bigger, there are more varieties & more types of food here, & one also can find alot of very good food here too. At cheap prices."
,,Local yummy,4.0,,Many local foods which allow locals or foreigners to try it. It is conveniently located and access by public transports. Opposite is Scared tooth temple and further away is another good place for local foods - Smith street food centre.
,,A place with good food,5.0,,"Hawker centre is between MRT station Tanjong Pagar and Chinatown, you may have a breakfast there then visit Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum and Chinatown."
,,You Can't Go Wrong Here,5.0,,"Too many choices is the biggest problem. But, you can';t really make a bad choice. All of the food is excellent. Yes, the chicken and rice is great, but so is the Lor Mee!"
,,Great eatery,5.0,,"Fancy a quick bite in a budget, this is a place to be. Excellent location right next to China Town, with a huge verity of dishes to choose from. There are plenty of fresh juices choices as well. Enjoy :P"
,,Good value and a good range of options,4.0,,"We visited the food court for dinner at around 9pm. While many of the food stalls were closed, there was still a fair amount of options available. We loved the spring onion pancake, steamed buns, fried dumplings, and satay. Overall great value for what it was."
,,Cheap and variety,5.0,,This hawker centre offers a variety of cuisine. The Hainanese chicken is a must try. Average dish prices range from $3+. Highly recommended to try!
,,King of Food Court,4.0,,"this is your Cadillac of food courts. i've never seen anything that this in terms of quality and size.

keep in mind this is, after all, a food court. so no air conditioner and it gets hot and humid (in singapore, really?) and the food isn't the most sanitary in appearance. knowing singapore, maybe they have a higher sanitation standard than i know of but it sure does not look like it.

there are about a good 50 stalls. each no bigger than a 100 sq feet in size serving all sorts of food from simple coffee, to malaysian foods, indian foods, chinese, singaporean. you can watch your food being made by your sweating chefs.

the food is cheap (USD 2-3 per dish) and the portion is average. so it helps to try difference stalls for various flavors. you buy whatever that tickles your fancy.

the tian tian hainan chicken is a must try. it's won awards all over singapore and even the south east for its delicious chicken.

it's a good place to try, especially if you're a tourist, if you don't mind the relative unsanitary appearance. food is good and cheap but i don't really find myself wanting to go there frequent. it's too hot and humid."
,,Great food and great prices!!,5.0,,"Was recommended to me by a friend.

Most restaurants in Singapore are fairly expensive for even the more basic meals, however here it was dirt cheap.

Lots of choice from over 30 different stands. Opted for a Chinese dish and was not disappointed. Paid $5sgn for the meal and another $5sgn for a large tiger beer.

The food was excellent, the prices were cheap and the atmosphere was lovely.

Definitely stop here for lunch or dinner if you have the chance."
,,Cheap and great,5.0,,A little difficult to find with construction works all around . But worth ot. Cheap and not huge. Loved it.
,,"Great food, also a great spot to people watch",5.0,,"We came here for their most famous Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken -- which was unfortunately closed on Mondays (take note of that!). But we happily still ended up with great food choices -- indian food, chinese food, laksa, coffee and tea. What is great about this place is that the locals really thrive here. The people from the surrounding offices come down at lunchtime to eat, the elderly people hang out and drink coffee and tea in the morning, etc. Food and people watching at its best."
,,A Must Eat!,4.0,,"Maxwell Road Hawker Centre is just steps from Chinatown and great way to eat authentic food with prices that will keep you coming back. Singapore can be very expensive to eat and there is a huge variety of inexpensive eats to be had here.

As I had not eaten here before I wandered around this place looking for something to satisfy my mid-day hunger. It was hard to decide which place to eat at -- so I did what any sensible traveller would do and I found the stall with the longest line up of locals and queued up and placed my order!

I was not disappointed - I had a great lunch of chicken and rice for 4 dollars. It was a great bargain and delicious food.

Maxwell Hawker Centre is a must eat while in Singapore in my opinion."
,,"Quick, cheap and clean",5.0,,"A hawker's center is a must in Singapore. They are excellent value for money, offer a huge variety of foods, and give the traveler a glimpse into the life of the locals. I had the chicken rice (a Singapore signature dish) and the sugar cane juice - all for under S$10.
If you want fine dining, definitely not your scene - but a great way to sample a good number of delicacies, without going bankrupt!"
,,ALways know the best by the lines of the people,4.0,,I read reviews of this centre and as they said look for the longest lines. They were right I had a long wait and by the time I got to order my pick was sold out but I tried another in fact I got three dishes for less for S$9. all were delicious. I would recommend that you go but go early do not leave until the last minute otherwise you will miss the best dishes.
,,Incredibly Large & Heaps of Variety,4.0,,"We love this type of eating Enabling us to try a huge array of different foods very cheaply.
It is always busy & hot, what else would you expect in Singapore?? But is always tasty & appears to be an effort to keep a high standard of cleanliness & we never worry about getting sick from poor health standards with each stall having to display their rating from the local health department"
,,great local food,5.0,,food is nice and relatively cheap! their western food always has a long long queue but it is worthwhile. they are famous for oldies store selling local food like trishaw noodles and dimsum.. porridge. chicken rice is also very nice!
,,Good Variety of Local Food,4.0,,"One of the best way to experience the vast variety of local Singapore food is to visit a hawker centre. There are many all over Singapore. This one is located centrally and personally I prefer the food here to Lau Pat Sat. Chicken rice is popular so is the porridge stall. Order Soya Bean Milk drink or Chin Cao (black herbal jelly) drink to go with your food. If you dare, mix both together! They are often sold at the same drink store. Try the cold desserts too like Ice Kachang, Ice Jelly or Chin Tang. Can't decide? Just look at the many pictures at the dessert stall and tell them which number. :) it gets extremely crowded on weekend lunch time cos it is in the CBD area.
Other popular hawker centers to try - People's Park at Chinatown and Old Airport Road Hawker Centre (Mountbatten MRT Station or Dakota MRT Station - walking distance)"
,,Food for the masses,4.0,,"There is no doubt that Singapore is a very expensive venue for drinking and dining.
Try the hawker centres for food where you can get Indian Chinese and Malay food at rock bottom prices. Totally informal where you go in pick what type of food you wish at one of several stalls and then sit where you wish. I tried it hundreds of times in the five years I was based in Singapore"
,,Best hawkers centre in 2015 !,5.0,,"Nearly all the great tasty foods & deserts here ! Don't miss Tian Tian Chicken Stall. Delicious boneless chicken feets,steam tender chicken meat with bones,not forgetting gizzards too ! Besides these,there are Satays(chicken,lamb & pork skewers)accompanied with tasty onions,cucumbers & tasty peanut sauce for dippings! Oyster omelette. Rojak(a mixture of cut up fruits & Yu tiow stir fry in shrimp paste sauce with sugar(with or WO.chilly spice),not forgetting fresh crushed sugar cane with lemon as beverages! So damn Cool & delicious ! Whenever u r in SG,never miss it !"
,,The essence of Singapore,5.0,,"When you visit Singapore, you must eat with the locals-- they know the best and cheapest food! We had delicious carrot cake (not what you think), chicken and rice and fresh cane juice to drink."
,,"chicken & rice, congee, foodie heaven...",5.0,,cheap amazing food. what's more to love? try the chicken & rice. This place is a must visit when visiting Singapore. Great for lunch.
,,Cycled 25km 1-way to eat this,4.0,,"Since it's a Depaavali holiday, we decided to cycle to Maxwell Road Hawker Centre with the breakfast as incentives. What else do you aim for after 25km of cycling? Ah Guan Mee Pok!! One of the best in Singapore. They have their own creation that come with fish maw, a compelle piece of fish cake and a half egg, firm on the white but flowing soft in the yoke. Three are at least 3-4 more variety with some extra like squid and abalone. A basic bowl start at $3.50. The soup is so yummy.

Strongly recommended!!"
,,Top listing hawker centre to go for both local and visitor,5.0,,"They are many different local dishes to try out at Maxwell Hawker. You definitely can't go wrong with this place.

Many willing to stand on a long line for the Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice. While waiting, why not have a friend/ family member to help you go to the stall nearby to order a piece of Fuzhou Oyster Cake? It's a bit salty though, however if you love oyster and something crunchy to bite on. Go ahead and try a piece. After all it's $2 per slice.

How to find it in such a big hawker centre? Remember it's at stall #5."
,,Voted Best Recently,4.0,,"Cater more for office crowd, this food market is now a full food centre instead of a market. They have the well known ""Tian Tian"" chicken rice stall which is always long queue during lunch hour. Do try the mixed vegetables rice stalls and also the dough pancakes fritters and enjoy our local favourites."
,,Cheap food in the CBD,4.0,,"It is hard to find cheap food in the CBD, so this is already one huge plus point. It's not air-conditioned, and it does get really crowded especially during lunch times, but the wide variety of mostly good hawker food and great price makes up for the weaknesses."
,,Awesome for lunch,5.0,,"We were checking out Chinatown and then made our way over to Maxwell Food Centre for lunch. Lots of options and seating, ice cold beers from one of the vendors served in frosty mugs. Great place to relax and take it in."
,,"Crazy busy , crazy good",4.0,,"It was great , food was bloody amazing and the price was crazy cheap ,............an enormous selection of dishes was available , essentially endless variety . You could eat here every day for a couple of months and have something different everyday"
,,Good and cheap price,5.0,,"There are so many food to try in Maxwell market. Must try the rojak, chicken rice and scissor curry rice ."
,,Disappointing,2.0,,"We decided to go here rather than eat in Chinatown but that was probably a mistake. We were very disappointed with the centre. Firstly it is very hot and humid in the building as there is no air conditioning so be prepared to eat with sweat pouring into your food. It is very popular so it's hard to find a spare seat. There are lots of stalls to choose from and the food is very cheap ranging from $2.50 -$4.50. There were lots of people buying from the stall we chose but our food was really disappointing. We chose a Chinese version of pad thai and got a plate of greasy, tasteless noodles with 2 old and tired-looking prawns. The dish was inedible and after 3 mouthfuls we gave up in disgust as it was truly awful. Maybe we were unlucky in what we chose. The other people at our table didn't look as if they had terribly appetising meals either. This was a shame as I remember the old hawker centres from years ago when the food was really good and fresh."
,,Very good value,5.0,,"In a city where eating out is not cheap, this was very good value as well as providing good food away from the main Singapore river/Marina Bay setting. We were amongst the very few tourists here which was a bonus and made it more authentic. We loved the experience."
,,"Good value, genuine food",4.0,,"Genuine, great tasting food in a semi- outdoor environment. Hole-in-the-wall type of food stalls where you find yourself a seat among the shared tables."
,,Great food at outdoor foodcourt,5.0,,The local food here is great and you can taste all the wonderful types of food in Singapore! Must try if you are here.
,,"Busy, hot and delcious",5.0,,"So many choices! It is hot and noisy, and you may have trouble finding a seat especially if you are in a group. We ended up getting our food takeaway including incredible mango lassis."
,,Breakfast on a weekend,4.0,,"One of my least preferred place these days due to parking problems as they are doing some work to the area. Seems like taking forever to renovate but I was driven on a Saturday to try one of the beautiful Mee Pok (egg noodles) supposedly tastes really good.

The noodles were good, so was the freshly cooked two pieces of king prawns, comes with fish maw, half an egg, with a fish cake.

The soup tastes without MSG. It was so good that I just have to ask for another bowl of delicious, steamy hot soup.

Definitely , worth a visit with no regrets despite having to hunt for a parking space."
,,Must do visit,5.0,,"For your Hainese Chicken Rice, look for the queue at Tian Tian and eat there. We had chcjen rice, Popiah and Rojak. This is a must visit Hawker good centre fairly quiet, very cheap, the chicken rice small portion was SG$3.50 or one pounds 75 to you Brits"
,,Seriously awesome hawker centre!,5.0,,I had the most incredible Hainanese chicken rice in the entire world at Maxwell Road's Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice. It was the epitome of what Hainanese chicken rice should be. Also not to be missed is the rice porridge stand with really delicious congee. There are tons of stalls in this hawker centre with something for everyone - you gotta check it out!
,,"Great selection of food, very cheap by Singapore standards",5.0,,"I read that if you only go to one Hawker Market in Singapore, make sure it is this one. So that is what we did.
We were not disappointed. The choice of food is staggering and the price is great. You will get a meal for about S$3.50 and a large bottle of Tiger beer for about S$7. Tie a visit to this food court in with a stroll around Chinatown. Not to be missed."
,,Hainan Chicken Rice @ Tian Tian,4.0,,"Go to Maxwell, eat Hainanese Chicken Rice, and AVOID Tian Tian! Since Gordon Ramsey helped putting them on the map of foodies visiting Singapore, they seem to have lost their Hawker's DNA! Overpriced and mediocre quality. Rice and broth cost extra (??!!)."
,,Sweet Potato Snack,4.0,,"You have got to try this Grandma's sweet potato. Having tasted it today, I am thinking about having it again. This is something you get after a savoury meal because it it sweet. Deep fried sweet potato wrapped around red bean or peanuts inside...Amazing! Travelers should have a go at this...!!"
,,So manu Asian delights in the one spot,4.0,,"Singapore is full of Food Courts or Hawker Stalls.

I love Singapore's Hawker Stalls and the food that they offer. I have been known to manoeuvre a stop over in Singapore, just so I can enjoy its 'street food' offerings.

I never eat in restaurants in Singapore, why would you when hawker food is so damn good, so fresh and so cheap?

The Maxwell Food Centre is located near Chinatown in Singapore and has a wide cross section of offerings from each of the ethnic groups. It is open from 0800 to 2200 each day. It is probably at its busiest in the daytime.

It is one of my favourites"
,,"Good, honest to goodness every day food",4.0,,Excellent selection of every day Singapourean food at every day prices. Great tastes with something for everyone.
,,Great Food Selection,4.0,,"We came across this area while out walking in Singapore - it was only 800 meters from our hotel. It consists of lots of small independent units run by families offering a great selection of different foods - Singaporean, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Indian etc. Some stalls sell drinks at much lower prices then nearby bars / restaurants and a main dish averages S$5 per person. The format appears to be to get a space at tables of 5 or 6 and one person to stay and reserve available seats. Locals put a pack of tissues at the space on the table while they go to order - this signifies that the seat is taken. You can choose from whatever stall you wish and go to different stalls for starters, mains and desserts as required. A great experience and a shared table allows you to (perhaps) speak with locals or visitots from other countries."
,,Come here hungry!,4.0,,"Only one thing to say, come here hungry! There is so much choice: it is real, noisy, hot n happening and you just need to dive in and get sampling. I made a big mistake of not trying enough as I wasn't ready for lunch. I can vouch for the soursop juice! And the atmosphere... And while everyone is queuing up for chicken, there was no queue at the lady's kiosk selling sweet potato buns! Lovely snack, I want more.

Forget the restaurants. Just go."
,,Good Value,4.0,,"VERY busy - but we arrived around 12.30. Lots of office workers. We didnt quite understand the ""tissues"" on the chairs, but after a while assumed they were to say ""this seat is taken"". Good value but be prepared to wander around with a plate looking for somewhere to sit, otherwise go at off peak."
,,Real Singapore food,4.0,,Normally maxwell is office workers and travelers lunch place. Various local food selection you can choose. Just one thing i do not like is OUTDOOR... but its still wellknown eating place.
,,Even local people loving this place,5.0,,"If you are to find out what are the cheap food that local people love eating, you cannot miss out this location.

Firstly it is located opposite Buddha tooth temple and at Chinatown area. I believe this location can be easily slot in your schedule.

You can eat the famous ""zhen zhen porridge"" shop. However you must be prepared for long queue. Of course it will worth it. If not jus directly opposite zhen zhen stall there is fish soup stall, I am not a fish lover person but this stall is one of my favorite. You can choose to add milk to your soup. It will create a smoother taste in your mouth.

Order a cup of sugar cane juice as sg weather is humid and hot, thus this drink is part of our local favorite drink. It is sweet but there is no sugar added. It is all natural sweetness from sugar cane.

If you still have room for dessert, do try cold bean curd or local dessert like ice kachang.
Eat like local and spend small amount of money."
,,Chicken rice,4.0,,"If you don't like waiting in a queue, you should go to ‚ÄùÈòø‰ªî‚Äù not ‚ÄùÂ§©Â§©‚Äù. Actually ‚ÄùÈòø‰ªî‚Äù is more popular among Shingaporean. Chinese porridge of another stall also tasts delicious!"
,,Favourite Hawker Centre,4.0,,"This would definitely be my favourite Hawker Centre and I would say the most 'comfortable' for visitors/holidaymakers. It's light and bright, very clean and easy to get the hang of. Just take a walk round the centre, look at all the stalls (long queues can be a guide as to what's popular with the locals). Having decided, join the queue, (most have photos of the food on offer) so you can point, but they usually understand what you want to order, if you are with a friend, get them to secure a seat (sharing a table is the norm) or if on your own, place a small pack of tissues on the seat, and locals will know it is 'reserved'. Prices by Western standards are incredibly cheap and super fresh.and tasty. The famous Singaporean chicken rice is on offer at several stalls and is obviously a must try, as would be the deep fried bananas (absolute yum yum) fresh coconut water drunk out of the shell and really,anything else that takes your fancy. It's all good. Arriving just before midday can be helpful as you'll be ahead of the locals and more easily able to secure a table. Definitely a highlight of,any visit to Singapore."
,,Massive food court,4.0,,It's the biggest food court never seen! Lot of choice. I tried a Thai food and it was really good! To much tourist in this place!
,,Clean and cheap,5.0,,It was fun to have so many choices and was conveniently located outside the Singapore museum. So. Lean in factbim ouldn't find a garbage can!!
,,Local food of every type all under one roof,4.0,,"This is a well known spot to get some real authentic local food... Choose from various vendors and sit wherever you want

Get rice dishes, noodles, fresh juices and more

Good prices and tasty

Find the best by queuing with the longest queues of locals and you'll do well"
,,50th Birthday Dinner,4.0,,"On the eve of Singapore‚Äôs 50th birthday celebration, my left-handed daughter and I had dinner at the Maxwell Food Center. By local custom, we placed a tissue packet on a vacant table and went perusing the food stalls.

With about one hundred different places serving a dizzying array of aromatic and appetizing fares, we were mystified by the choices and unable to decide what to eat. Bewildered, we just picked the longest line and waited in it. Before our eyes, the affable and impassioned chef sliced sizzling strips of pork, and heaped it atop a mountain of delicate noodles.

Returning to our table, we found a group of ill-informed tourists in our ‚Äúreserved‚Äù seats. Overlooking this serious breach of hawker center etiquette, we moved to another table, and dug into our seasoned pork noodles.

As we savored our meals, an eloquent Singaporean gentleman with a shiny bald head approached us. He smiled broadly and said to my daughter that he had never before seen a woman hold chopsticks in her left hand. Now a 72-year-old retired professor, he went on to generously teach us about his country‚Äôs short but proud history and amalgamated culture.

At the Maxwell Food Center there are a myriad of menu choices that epitomize the country‚Äôs world-class food culture. Our meals were immensely enjoyable, but it was our lucky encounter with a brilliant member of Singapore‚Äôs pioneer generation that proved to be a most enlightening way to celebrate Singapore‚Äôs 50th birthday."
,,not much,3.0,,I have good expectation since reading many good reviews about this eatery... however when I got there I must swallow my expectations lol as I see from all food kiosk there only 2 of them serve halal food. oh well.
,,Tian tian hainam chicken rice,3.0,,"Good taste for chicken rice (cold chicken rice), even antony bourduin say the samething, if you go singapore, you should try ..."
,,Amazing local food,5.0,,This is a Hawker Centre with traditional food stalls. The selection of food is amazing at an incredibly low price. Most meals are less than $6. It is very busy at lunchtime but you will always find a seat.
,,Favorite Food Center,4.0,,"Visited Singapore and tried 5 of the hawker centers. This was our favorite. Plenty of seating in open air environment with fans. We tried Hainese chicken rice, peanut pancake, carrot cake (not carrots at all, that's just what it's called), fresh sugar cane juice, red bean buns. We wanted to try other items but some stalls were sold out by the time we arrived (after 2 p.m. for lunch.)"
,,Get in Early,4.0,,"Went here for lunch with business colleagues to try the traditional Singapore Dishes: Kway Teo, Chicken Rice, Sugar Cane Drink.
We got in early to beat the crowds, the prices are very cheap and the servings are well generous.

No air con, so get a seat under a fan."
,,Good food centre,4.0,,It's easy to find and get to. The food centre is a 10 min walk from the Chinatown MRT. There are plenty of food stalls to choose from and has one of the most popular hainanese chicken places in Singapore.
,,Best Chicken Rice,4.0,,"Tons of food at this hawker centre. One of the top stall is Tian Tian Chicken rice. Be prepared to queue for at least 20 mins if you are there for lunch. However, to beat the queue, get there around 10.30am for a early brunch.

More stalls are opened till late. Pretty much a place to satisfy all your Singapore food cravings. Best way to get there is by MRT, stop at Chinatown station and about 5 mins walking distant."
,,Not a great place to eat for late lunch,3.0,,I'm excited to eat at this famous hawker center but we arrived around 3pm to eat lunch. :( Few stalls are open. But few people also eat so no need to search for a table. :) The place is not that far from the MRT station. You will pass the Temple streets and Sago streets with plenty of shops and temples. :)
,,Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,5.0,,There was a 20 minute line when I was there. Need I say more? They really didn't need the posterboard with Anthony Bourdain though.
,,Just average,3.0,,Went for lunch and only half the stalls were open. We found another HUGE hawker centre much better than Newton FC and much closer. It was never mentioned anywhere we just stumbled across it and have never seen such a large clean hawker centre with such a massive range of food. This will be our first stop next time in Singapore.
,,The Quintessential Singapore Hawker Food Experience,5.0,,"My staples every time I go to Maxwell are these: the min jian kueh chock full of crunchy peanut crumbles, the fresh fruit juices, the hainanese curry rice, freshly made homemade yong tau hu of original variety not found anywhere else on the island, and my favourite raw fish slices (sheng yu topped with lots of sliced red chili and ginger) and fish porridge. Yums."
,,Something for everyone,5.0,,"This is the only unique hawker centre that has a great mix of office workers, tourists and school excursion students local and international. The food is good and price very affordable. Very good eats and a really vast variety. Palatable to all walks of life and a true melting pot. It gets more cosy during lunch time."
,,True Singaporean food - Under a hot tin roof! And all in one place and at great prices!,5.0,,"An old favourite hawker market, I went there with my parents after a recent visit to see my uncle in a nearby hospital. My parents remember when the market was dark, dinghy and smelly in the 1980s. Today, its bright and clean and the choice of local street cuisine - plenty! We had congee, braised mapo tofu and liver with spring onions in claypot from Fatty Porridge Shop - tucked away in the front corner ( I think that was the stall's name). All that for under $25 and we finished the meal with fresh sugar-cane juice and cut fruits. The ceiling fans also helped to keep it cool over dinner time. We got there at 830pm and it wasn't too crowded."
,,Try one time is enough,3.0,,"The food and the restaurant, especially some famous Hainam chicken restaurant in this food center, which aren't very good as I expected."
,,Definitely should visit this locally famous hawker centre for both tourists and locals,4.0,,"There is no way to describe this place. It's a food heaven for all. A hawker centre full of great, affordable and authentic Singaporean food gathers here. Tourists need not be worried to be conned for extra money when buying the food. Prices are all stated clearly on the boards. And they do not make scams. If they do, call local police instantly.

Find famous stalls like local delicacies such as Hainanese Chicken Rice, Wanton Noodles (Roast Pork with dumplings), Ice-Kacangs, Chendols (all local desserts), Chicken/Minced Pork Porridge, Chwee Kuehs (steamed grinded rice), Japanese Bentos, Western Food etc. Rem to try our Sugar Cane juice which is known to be cooling for our bodies, especially in Singapore where we are a hot climate country. This beverage is really nice, with or without additional $0.20 to $0.50 of lemon slice. Try it!!! Also try our local tea (Teh) and coffee (Kopi) as well. I am sure you will find something you like from the drink stalls too."
,,One of the best foodcourt,4.0,,You can get some of the best local street food in singapore over here. The chicken rice is the best in singapore.
,,Rich Variety of Local Foods,3.0,,"This place is a tough choice compared with the hawker center at the big building in Chinatown. It's quite famous for the chicken rice stall that has a long queue. Personally, I find the rice a bit moist as I prefer chicken rice that has a grain to bite on. The Chinese style dumplings wrapped in bamboo leaves are really good and one can buy one and eat it at the hawker center. It's like a meal in itself."
,,Choices Galore !!,5.0,,"This was my first visit to Singapore, and being a self appointed ""Foodie"", I relied on the recommendations of a friend as to where to eat in Singapore.
Maxwell's was really easy to get to from my hotel, and is well known by all the taxi drivers, so you won't have any issues finding the place.
Maxwell's is an open air market place type set up, and every shop/stall is food or drink.
I walked around the place in amazement at how busy it was, and the mix of clientele.
By mix, I refer to locals and tourists alike.
Not having been there before, I employed my usual practice of eating at the place that had the biggest queue of locals.
This just happened to be at Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice.
I estimated the queue to be around an hour long, and did give thought to NOT joining the queue because of that reason, but joined the queue anyway.
It took 40 minutes to get to the front of the queue.
The service was quick once at the front of the line, the food was cheap, awesome, and well worth the 40 minute wait.
There are probably around 100 shops there, and you can get everything from the famous chicken rice, to Chillie Crab, Fish, and everything else imaginable.
Maxwell Food Centre is a MUST go to place when you're in Singapore."
,,Good mix,3.0,,Nice hawker centre with a good mix of food variety.. Famous for the chicken rice here. Recommended to come here for a meal ...
,,Hawker centre near Chinatown,4.0,,Literally 2 minutes walk from Chinatown. Queued up for ages for the Hainese Chicken but gave up in the end but apparently it's worth the wait..look out for the long queues to find out the good stalls. Great option for a lunch break in between Chinatown exploration.
,,Great experience,4.0,,Great variety of hawker food; family favourite are the 'bean doughnuts' watching them make them is a real experience!
,,"Real Singapore hawker food, inexpensive and tasty",4.0,,"Everyone must try the Tian Tian Chicken Rice, it's worth waiting in line for. But there are many more treats: Granny's Pancake, Sliced Fish Bee Hoon, laksa, among the many I tried while I was staying nearby. It's not elegant dining by any stretch, but it's good food and a memorable experience for $5-$10 or less."
,,Amazing vareity,5.0,,"This place has all local variety of singapore food, my fav here are the thai food, the beef noodle shop, Nusantara the malay fried rice shop. Sadly no good indian food here, alot of chicken rice and fruit juice shops. You should try the fresh sugar cane juice with lemon in it."
,,Home of Tian Tian,4.0,,"Just off China Town, this nicely laid out and very well ventilated Hawker Centre is home to the now famous Tian Tian Chicken rice stall, with its long line going out the door. Fairly clean, great choice of food, very nice food centre"
,,Average street food,3.0,,This center is ok. We didn't find anything terribly delicious. It was cheap- eg. A meal for $4 SGD. I probably wouldn't bother again.
,,Cheap eats,4.0,,"While here, check out the rival chicken rice stalls. Tian Tian has recovered it's mojo after losing its head chef. The banana fritters are also hot. The porridge from the corner stall is proof you don't need to be sick to tuck into conger."
,,Delicious chicken rice in Chinatown area,3.0,,"Many good local food in this place. Strongly recommended to try Tian-Tian Chicken Rice. However, the air circulation inside is not flowing, maybe it's because of the construction in progress (future MRT station?) besides the food centre. Overall, it's recommended to visit and try the food in there."
,,Missing it already,5.0,,"Can't believe this fantastic food centre isn't one of the highest ranked attractions in Singapore. Best chicken rice ever. If you're not aware of the Chicken Rice War, google it right now. I have tried the product from both protagonists and personally I favour the breakaway startup. Both places can be spotted by the queue of enthusiasts. Eat at either; you can't go wrong. Other stalls to try: the legendary BBQ duck and pork dude, also identifiable by the queue; and the old lady who does the brilliant fried sweet potato balls."
,,Great place for a cheap eat,4.0,,If there is one place in the world to try street food and not worry - it's Singapore. We had an excellent meal at the Hawker Centre. Seating may be basic but the food is packed full of flavour and so cheap. We both ate dinner for less than a fiver.
,,Lots of cheap eat options!,4.0,,"If you're staying in Chinatown or in the area, I highly recommend trying a dish or two at Maxwell Food Centre. I found this hawker food centre cleaner and less chaotic than others I visited in Singapore and there is plenty of choice. I tried Laksa, congee and hainan chicken and was not disappointed. However, the food centre is very hot, chaotic and basic, so it's good for a simple, cheap and quick meal but I would recommend it as a place to have a long and relaxing meal. It's very much fast food, but fantastic for foodies on a budget!"
,,Chicken rice,5.0,,I always check in at Maxwell for a chicken rice and a couple of big Tiger Beers whenever I pass through Singapore. If you can't find something delicious to eat here you're doing it wrong.
,,So much local food to choose from!,5.0,,"If you love local cuisine at budget prices, go to Maxwell Hawker center. There are plenty of options to choose from. We loved the tian tian chicken rice (definitely lives up to the hype), fried sweet potato dumpling, and fried oysters. We went a little after lunch time and didn't encounter a huge crowd. All in all, was a fun experience that I'd definitely recommend if you like local food!"
,,Cool food and lots of varieties,4.0,,There a lota of cheap and good food ranged from SGD3 (USD2.6). With traditional food like Cha Kway Teow to Hainan Chicken rice and drinks and desserts and much more.This is a must try place if u wanna experience the Singapore traditional life and culture.

,,Old arhitecture hawker place.,4.0,,It is in the financial center of Singapore. The area around is of high rise buildings. This hawkers food center is clean with a large variety and you can try many dishes and deserts.
,,Singapore Reality Spa,5.0,,"this is a place top go for a reality cleanse - it's messy, crowded, authentic and a little rough compared to the rest of controlled mild-mannered Singapore. I had a meal from 3 hawkers for less than US$8 total - chicken sate, nasi goreng (...More"
,,Value for $$$$,5.0,,"Some of the best food we have found in Singapore at some of the cheapest prices Easy relaxed setting, pull up a table and enjoy. Can easily eat and drink for less than $10"

Of course, she would not miss the ""goreng pisang"" , i.e. deep fried banana fritters and a celestial cup of Malay icy ""chiando"" , i.e. a palm sugar cum red bean thirst-quencher ... something for her to relive and refresh her younger days at home ..."
,,Singapore lunch,5.0,,"Obviously if you come here, you must try Tian Tian hainanese chicken rice. It is always packed with long queue but the pfood is worth the wait. The chicken rice is the best among hawkers.

Afterwards try the fried banana which closes before 3 pm. It is one of the best tasting fried banana in singapore.

The price in this food center is also affordable, unlike the other more commercial food center. Overall its a worthy place to visit."
,,Great Variety Hawker Center NOT restaurnat,5.0,,Not air conditioned so best to visit in the night. Great variety @ cheap prices. Pretty authentic and an interesting spread as you visit the different stalls
,,A great range of food at bargain prices.,4.0,,"Great range of food stalls, all cheap - $3 to $5 and all good. We particularly liked stall 71 (get there early and join the line - it sells out by & pm. The mixed meat on rice or noodles is worth it.) stall 68 for Hainaese Curry Rice is fantastic (also sells out quickly) and the fried dumplings served by the old woman oat stall 93 are great. You could spend weeks sampling the different stalls."
,,Great Value and Delicious!,4.0,,"We've been to Maxwell Road Hawker Centre numerous time and on this latest occasion, quite a few stalls were closed (presumably due to the haze?) Nevertheless, we had some seafood kway teow, popiah, gyoza, chicken rice and beers at very affordable prices. The food came to less than SGD$20 and fed four of us for dinner. The flavours were great and the service quick!"
,,A must place to eat,5.0,,"If you want the best hawker centre, GO HERE THE MAXWELL CENTER. The Best of the Hawker centres. We had satay sticks 10 for 10ssd, chicken and rice and beef noodles both dishes cost approx together 20ssd about ¬£10 and we had 2 large beers a cost of 10ssd about ¬£5. the food was excellent. my boyfriend also had pure sugar cane juice which tasted great and was refreshing. all in all well worth a visit.
We went back a couple of times to eat, and we even got the mother in law to eat here, and she is very fussy, she did enjoy it, the choice of stalls is endless and the atmosphere is relaxed and fun, many different nationalities and ages.
We left here always with full bellies."
,,Many choice,4.0,,You can find what you want to eat. It's also cheap food court as well. Singapore is so expensive country. If you want to save some money for traveling. You should go there
,,A place must visit in Singapore.,5.0,,"Famous Tian Tian chicken rice ( Blue banner) is located in this food center.
just beware, there are a lot of chicken rice sellers in same food center with blue banner, but that's only one belong to Tian Tian chicken rice.
How to distinguish it? Answer: Look at the LONG Queue.."
,,Aiyaaaaaaaaaaaaa,3.0,,"Visited this hawker in August of 2015 and we had a mixed experience. On one hand, we got to experience some delicious food for a very small amount of money. On the other hand, we were crowded into a very hot space with a lot of other hungry people and it was a bit chaotic. The woman helping clear tables and yelling AIYA at everyone wasn't helping the situation either. We are happy that we visited but will be skipping Maxwell on our next trip to Singapore. If you do visit Maxwell, make sure to bring your patience and cool clothing."
,,Excellent authentic inexpensive eating,4.0,,Great cheap fresh and delicious food and drink where actual Singaporeans seemed to be eating too....not a commercial mall
,,Excellent cheap eat!,4.0,,"The famous Tian Tian chicken rice is hidden at the back of this hawker food center. Its worthwhile to explore around the hawker center and wander to it. Chicken rice here is inexpensive; starting from SG$3.50 for a plate of delicious rice and some plain but nicely cooked chickens. Other than this, this center also sells great local hawker fares like popiah, rojak, fried oysters etc...all at very reasonable prices. Maxwell Road Center is certainly the place to go for great Singapore street food!"
,,"Messy, crowded, but awesome satay and beer",4.0,,"Unlike many eating places in Singapore, the Maxwell Road Food Centre doesn't reflect the squeaky clean Singapore image. It however has amazing hawker stalls, great satay that goes super well with Sugar cane juice or beer. Good place to visit if you have a gang of 4 - 6."
,,Real Singapore food!,5.0,,Right next door to our hotel. Thought it might be a bit intimidating but after a few minutes watching others the process was easy. Feel free to try different things from different stalls and all very cheap by SGP standards.
,,Yummy Food!,5.0,,"The food here is cheap but very tasty. The place is very clean and orderly, and the people who work there are very helpful."
,,"Good Food, Best Value",5.0,,"Zhen Zhen porridge is so far my favorite.
The food quality is very good and very affordable. You must add the ""brown condiment"" to bring out the food flavor. (They close at 2:30pm).
The Famous Tien Tien Chicken is worth going to Maxwell. The chicken is tender and the rice is fragrant.
across Tien Tien Chicken is a stall that sell Noodles. must order the Hookien Mee."
,,Great food 24 x7 and cheap too,5.0,,"We were only in Singapore for two days so trying to cram everything in so on day 1 we didn't have time for dinner at the usual sort of time as we dashed to the night safari which meant we returned to the city around midnight feeling rather hungry so our taxi driver suggested the Hawker Centre and what a gem. There were lots of stalls selling various satay but many others selling all the cuisine varieties you'd expect in Singapore.

Ok it was midnight so some were closed but there was still plenty of choice, my wife and I ate for 38 sgd and were full. Also drinks are very cheap considering Singapore prices, 5 dollars for a mug of beer about 330 mls at a guess. They also sold jugs that worked out even cheaper. A real Singaporean experience within a 10 minute stroll of our hotel."
,,Maxwell Hawker Centre,4.0,,"So many outstanding dishes in Maxwell Hawker Centre. The self-frying hum-cheem piah.. the Ho Kee cheok.. the Satay Bee Hoon & Cuttle-Fish.. the Fish Soup.. the Ho Kee Bao, Cheok and Sang Yu, the Goreng Pisang.. and the Tian-Tian chicken rice.

I think the hawker centre is still under renovation."
,,Yummy food!,4.0,,"Great Hawker center. Went for Tian-tian chicken rice and it was delicious! Just a tip, don't come at 8am when another site says they open. Tian-tian didn't start serving until 10am. Some stands (not a lot) were open though when I arrived (around 9am) serving fruit juices, pastries and soup so you can try them while waiting."
,,Hainan Chicken Rice!,4.0,,"We decided to try the well-known Tian Tian chicken rice here, caught a taxi from Marina Bay and we arrived during the lunch hour rush on a Thursday. It was full of office workers and aunties. Love the atmosphere, open-air food court, with the other half of the centre selling fruits and vegetables. Advise: get someone from your group to (sit)book a table prior to ordering as tables are limited. Also don't be surprised to share tables with other people, and like most asian countries, bring tissues.

There was an efficient queue for Tian Tian but the orders came out quick as they were well-staffed. We ordered chicken rice and bean sprout with cuttlefish to accompany. There were multiple drinks stalls in the hawker centre as well. Great food and great price, miss the chicken rice (~AUD$3-4 per plate), would definitely come here again!

Taxi were not hard to come by in the area."
,,Lots of choice and cheap,4.0,,We stayed in the Scarlett hotel and often popped into the maxwell centre for a quick bite. The food is very tasty and quick. Just not to go during lunchtime when it is packed
,,Good rojak,4.0,,Apparently Tian tian chicken rice is good. Did not try. Shops were only half open at 10am. Good variety and there are sinks to wash up. Clean and airy.
,,Wide range of good food,5.0,,"There are quite a number of good hawker food at Maxwell Road Hawker Centre. The Tian Tian chicken rice is really good, tender chicken with fragrant rice. Marina black carrot cake is tasty too. There are also peanut soup, pumpkin cake and porridge."
,,Delicious Authentic Food,5.0,,Too many choices in affordable prices. Tasted the authentic kaya toast and coffee with spicy noodles and Indian cuisine without breaking the bank. Definitely a must try!
,,Great food at cheap prices,4.0,,"This is a great place to find something to eat - we stopped here for a late lunch on a Sunday afternoon. Not all the food stalls were open, however there was still plenty of variety.

Our meals cost $4.50 and $4 each for prawn dumplings and pork and rice, and it was delicious.

Well worth visiting for a cheap eat in Singapore."
,,Authentic Place for Food in Chinatown,5.0,,"Maxwell is one of the first Hawker Centers and always a good and conveniently located place to have cheap good food. It operates as normal even with the current roadwork in the area. The longest lines are usually at Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice (Stall 10 and 11), but before 11:30 there is no or only a short line. Not surprisingly in Chinatown, the centre's stalls offer mainly Cantonese food."
,,A big variety,4.0,,"We decided to give the Hawkers Centre a go after hearing good things on TV and reviews.
Quite a few of the stalls were closed, we went about 6.30pm.
There was a good variety of what was open and we followed what we heard and went to one of the stalls with one of the longest lines.
It cost us about $3.50 aud for a chicken and rice dish each, it was nice and of course a cheap meal."
,,Cheap and great food,5.0,,All kind of different food which you can find around Singapore which all been place inside a hawker centre. You can enjoy all of them without going else where.
,,Treasures in the heart of Singapore,5.0,,"Plenty of food to talk about but the 3 most ""must try"" are 1 Hainanese Chicken Rice. Be it Tian Tian or Ah Tai's. 2 Porridge Cantonese style from Zhen Zhen and 3 Hum Jin Pang at stall 28. The last is more for frying the fritters yourself than really the taste as these fritters are more snack than meal."
,,It is a local hawker centre not tourist-oriented,4.0,,"I like this because it is a local concept, unlike other hawker centres that serve tourist. the price is considered cheaper. the taste also very authentic. I like their fried quay teow, very delicious. Amazingly they open for 24 hours!"
,,Half of it closed,3.0,,I had heard some great reviews from tv programmes so off we went only to find half the stalls were closed so the variety wasn't there most stalls selling similar food after half hr of walking up and down each row trying to decide we settled on a great spot for chicken and rice which was delicious
,,Eat in Chinatown with the locals.,4.0,,This is not high end eating but there is a great variety of food and it's pretty cheap. We were there on a Monday night so less stalls were open than usual but still plenty of choices. The hawker centres are really worth visiting. The food is fresh and tasty and cooked just for you. I had the Hainanese chicken a local dish and always popular.
,,Great eating right near Chinatown,4.0,,This is one of my favorite food hawker centers in Singapore. You can get anything from pork dumplings to chicken rice to duck to Thai food and much much more. The variety here is awesome and its a fun place to go to a few times so you can try as many food stalls as possible. The prices are great too! Some food stalls have long lines but dont let that deter you. It's worth the wait !!
,,The place to eat in Singapore,5.0,,"We heard about the Maxwell Road Hawker Centre while on our cruise - this was from a Singaporean National who said that the best food in Singapore could be found here. A bold statement but we decided to give it a go.

The Centre is close to Chinatown, just opposite the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple.

There are probably close to 150 food and drink outlets and there is a variety of food for all tastes and palates, including vegetarian, muslim and many asian types.

The Hainan Chicken rice is excellent - don't be surprised if you have to queue to get served - it is well worth it.

The centre starts to close down around 7:00pm so you may need to get in early. We also had breakfast there at 8:00ish - most of the outlets were open at that time.

A real must for those who like street-type food at very reasonable prices."
,,Filthy and not somewhere I'd like to eat.,2.0,,"We were really looking forward to trying the food market out, but we got there and the tables were messy and the whole market was very dirty. There was no atmosphere here either so we went elsewhere."
,,Disappointed.,3.0,,"I took my extended family here as we were visiting China town & had read about Tian Tian chicken rice in the guide books.

We went at the usual lunchtime and it was extremely busy. We had to wait a long time for a table & even longer for the chicken rice. The food wasn't actually that good (I prefer other chicken rice) & the seating areas were pretty dirty. That might be due to how busy the hawker centre was though.

I probably wouldn't go there again & I'd rate other chicken rice much higher than Tian Tian."
,,Time to try something new,5.0,,If you want a taste and smell of the local cuisine - try a Hawker Centre. Maxwell was wonderful- with a taste of everything that Singapore has to offer. Tried chilly crab for the first time and it was fantastic!
,,Price is rational no excetion for good taste.,5.0,,"I'm in Thailand. I could probably say that in Thailand taste for Chicken rice of Tian Tian @Maxwell is different. Thai cooks much more intense than the Singapore's. Singapore's is lighter but the specialty is the texture of its meat. It's soft and very juicy. Talk about is and feeling drool. LOL. anyway it's a good expereince to try once. Another acknowledgement, all of you've gotta prepare your stomach. Coz you havta wait for super long QUEUE!!"
,,the best chicken rice,4.0,,"Maxwell Hawker Centre is an undercover collection of many restaurants . We went specifically for the chicken rice at Tien Tien. There was a long queue but well worth the wait.$Sing 19 for 3 large chicken rice and an order of bamboo shoots.
My wife said the other stalls also looked interesting so will visit again when next in Singapore"
,,"Hainan chicken and rice, the best, but go at lunchtime.",4.0,,"This is where Anthony Boudain recommends the Hainan Chicken and rice at Tian Tian stall, or you can try Ah Tian next door, who opened up in direct competition. Unfortunately both were closed by 7.45pm so another stall filled the bill. Lunchtime is the best, but also the busiest. Love the hawkers markets in Singapore, so many different types of food to try and all regulated and given a rating for hygiene etc. Most here had a B rating, street food at its best and safest."
,,Great Variety!,4.0,,Plenty of food to choose from but my favorite would be the Ho Kee Porridge at the corner. Great comfort food especially on rainy days. Order the Deep Friend Tofu as well!!
,,"Lots of variety, be prepared to queue",4.0,,"This is a food paradise frequented by locals and tourists alike. Popular choices are the Tian Tian chicken rice, Hainanese curry rice, fish porridge, and Ngoh Hiang Bee Hoon. For desserts, there's tau suan, dumplings, and Heng Heng tapioca lie and ondeh ondeh. Be prepared to queue, especially during lunchtime."
,,Great food at cheap prices,4.0,,"I visited here with my family in August which included my two 6 year old daughters.
Maxwell‚Äôs Food Court is situated outside the main part of Singapore. We used the MRT to Tanjong Pagar / Green line station, exit G, walk through the garden and turn right. The food court is about 5 mins away.
There was a large range of food available and all very reasonable priced (cheaper than downtown Singapore). There were also drinks available to include beer, soft drinks and fruit juices.
We went several times and tried lots of food, all of which was very good. Don‚Äôt be put off by plastic tables and chairs and the fact they cook the food in a small kitchen. The food is well worth it."
,,Cheap n tasty,4.0,,"Real option if you want no frills good cheap food ,don't let the surroundings put you off ,very reasonable and yummy chilli crab and a big beer was sd 60 inc rice veg and buns. Great service and nice staff."
,,Bad experience,2.0,,"Food is not that good after all. This place is overrated!! Not worth of spending the time to Q for the tian tian chicken rice. You can get much better chicken rice from else where in SG. The chicken is too cold. The hawker centre is crowded and packed especially during peak hour. Generally, this place is not clean, hot, packed and food are overrated."
,,Good cheap eats,4.0,,An experience eating among the locals & the odd tourist. A must - do for any foodie interested in hawker food. Look out for Kumera Dumplings- I loved the Pandang version!
,,Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice!,3.0,,"It was a long queue for this famous Tian Tian Hainanese chicken rice. I queued for 30-40 minutes to get my turn. I feel the chicken rice is nothing special. I have better chicken rice and taste better. it is just a place full with tourist, like a tourist must visit spot. But indeed it is nothing so fancy."
,,Good taste and variety food can find from here.,5.0,,They serve good local food. I have a good experience about Singaporean food at this food center. Noodles with fishball is the best!!!! Coffee and tea are nice. I can feel like I become a local people.
,,Something for everyone!,4.0,,"We arrived at about 10.30am on a weekday, although not every stall was open there will still more than enough choice! The place is huge and we have been warned that it is extremely busy between 1pm and 2pm. I had laksa and my husband had the famous Tian Tian hainanese chicken rice, both amazing!!! We will visit again before we leave Singapore"
,,Amazing Hainanese Chicken Rice at Ah Tai,5.0,,Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice (Stall 7) at Maxwell Road Hawker Centre dishes out some of the best Hainanese Chicken Rice ... A must Try
,,Fully Hot Air Hawker like a oven,2.0,,It was on my list for the area to visit. I walked around looking to all those stall at 17.00 hrs-ish. I was swet likes piggy. The price listed on those stalls was very cheap compared to elsewhere hawker centers. The chicken wings was extremely attractive. But I wouldn't be able to sit down and eat here. I could not/never sit in oven and enjoy my meal. It's impossible. List was checked. All done.
,,Amazing dining experience,4.0,,"Although cordoned off this year when we visited in August for adjacent building works, this 'food hall' serves an amazing diversity of food. It is full of locals, and don't expect forks anywhere. Located in Chinatown, it is a true Singapore experience."
,,Great variety of food!,4.0,,"The variety, tastes and environment is fantastic. Not to be short shifted. Cost of food reasonable and accessible all times of the day.The elegance of dining is missing but the food can't be replaced. like everything else in life, be cafeful. The adventure and tastes are worth the experience. Try it...you may like it!"
,,Lots of choice,5.0,,This place is so popular! A great choice of food and such cheap prices for Singapore. I had the Kumera balls which came in different flavours.
,,Chicken and rice.....,4.0,,"I never believed I would queue up for chicken and rice (Hainanese chicken) but I was on holiday so what the heck. We specifically went here for this chicken and on the first day went to one of the stalls that how no queue - the chicken was good but was even better at the place we went to the next day. Sadly I can't remember the name of that place BUT wherever you see the longest queue, you can guarantee that will be one of the best places to get chicken and rice. We timed ourselves and were in the queue for 1 hour... but it was worth it.... to have silky smooth chicken, rice and greens, we had one plate each of the steamed chicken and shared the roast chicken. I think each dish was about $5 - it was really very cheap. The Centre in general is great and while we were queueing took turns going off to get cold drinks, they have an array of stalls selling freshly squeezed juice. Despite the number of people who go through there every day, the tables are cleared frequently and we had no problem finding somewhere to sit and enjoy our chicken - absolutely delicious!"
,,Locals food tastes better than 5 star,5.0,,"Don't be intimidated by the hundreds of outlets each with a different flavour choice, mark your table with a tissue, remember the number and stand in line for a most delicious assortment of food from all corners of Asia. Hokkien chicken and rice is their signature dish but everything is well worth a try."
,,Had most meals here,4.0,,"Maxwell road seems to be more locals than tourists and if you want Hainanese chicken rice this is the place to go, also lots of other food types and dishes and all worth trying."
,,Singapore food at its best.,4.0,,"There is so much variety of the food there that it will take you months to go through them if you went for everything that's available and the quality of food there is as good as a Michelin hatted restaurant but for the ambiance.
The rojak and popiah there is to die for and the fish balls are crunchy and firm and yet delicate. Both stalls are in the centre row in the food court as there is 3 rows and it's more or less in the centre of the centre row."
,,"Many LOCAL Food Favourites, all in ONE Place ! Your taste buds and stomach will be well rewarded!",5.0,,"Whether you are a tourist or a resident, this hawker centre is one of the best! The food tastes better than those offered in food courts, because the latter are not manned by the 'original' cooks with their family recipes. Although yes it is very hot and humid, no air-conditioning and lots of queuing, if you want real good food, you just have to invest the time and effort, and bear with the discomforts.... But your taste buds and stomach will be well rewarded !"
,,Great Hawker Center but can be too hot,4.0,,"Being a hawker center you will be visiting for the food. My favorite stalls are Tian Tian Hai Nan chicken rice, Fish Rice Porridge in the middle, and fish soup stall opposite the porridge stall.
The Porridge stall typically closes by 12 30 if not sooner.
The others open until 6 30 maybe 7 pm.
The most comfortable place to sit is the row next to maxwell road. Once you sit inside, the poor air circulation creates a oven effect during a hot midday lunch."
,,Must go!,5.0,,"One of my long-time favourites . Very lovely ngoh-hiang, rice porridge, minced pork noodles, popiah, rojak. Great variety of local dishes. Always crowded during meal times. Sweat & Eat your hearts out!"
,,Great local food at reasonable prices.,4.0,,I frequently eat at this hawker centre when shopping in the Chinatown area. If you see a long queue at a particular stall you will know that their particular specialities are very popular with Singaporeans. There is plenty of choice so you don't have to join.
,,A breakfast where you can only find in Singapore,4.0,,"I went in the early morning of the Singapore National 50th Birthday, thinking that most stalls will be closed. But, surprisingly, I had heaps of variety to choose, from dim sum to porridge, to fishball noodle, laksa, chicken rice, and even Thai food. I'll be going there for a TYPICAL Singaporean Breakfast, where people have the ""you tiao"" or deep-fried flour which resembles chopsticks. They also have some popish, but it wasn't open that early in the morning.

If you prefer something heavy, you can choose to eat rice which goes with fish curry or chicken curry. True enough, as I'm studying in Australia, you will definitely have a wide range of choices here in Singapore. Enjoy!"
,,Great place to sample local fare,5.0,,"Maxwell Road Hawker Centre is a fabulous place to try the local fare,the atmosphere is great and the food is so good and the prices are ridiculously cheap!"
,,Using TripAdvisor we decided this would be worth a visit and we were not disappointed.,5.0,,The food was delicious and we loved the fact that certain stalls specialised in one dish. Haianese Chicken rice was what I was after but the stall selling the dish my husband was hoping to try was closed on the day we were there and he seemed reluctant to try another stall cooking the same thing. He was happy with Haianese Chicken Rice and amazed at the speed it took to prepare as well as the ridiculously low prices.
,,One of the best food court in town,4.0,,"As per the title, this place have plenty good and famous food in singapore, from chicken rice, pooridge, you cak we (fritter....I think...) and not to mention other food.....

Good place if you don't know what to eat as this place offer quite a fair bit of options."
,,Busy as usual,5.0,,"I am so glad to see this place has not changed much that many years. My favourites were still there ‚Äì fish rice noodles soup, the chicken rice, pepper char siew noodle and Zhen Zhen rice porridge. Prices had gone up as bit , but well worth it."
,,Hainanese Chicken rice ‚Äì delightful street food.,4.0,,"During a recent visit to Singapore my wife and I travelled by the MRT to Chinatown. At around midday we strolled down to the Maxwell Road Hawkers market for lunch. When researching the trip I had read about the Hainanese Chicken rice so we deccided to give it a try. There is a vast range of food available at the various stalls and the whole place is very busy. One can tell which stalls are the most popular (and possibly the best) by the length of the queues waiting patiently to be served. We eventually found the location of the stall we were looking for and were gratified to find the line of customers was long. After purchasing two serves for about $6.80 we eventually found a place to sit. We were astonished at the generosity of the serves and the quality of the food. It compared favourably to a very expensive restaurant we had recently visited.
To quote a great man ‚Äúwe will be back‚Äù."
,,Variety to eat,5.0,,We came here for breakfast and it was great. Simply for the variety - So many stalls to choose from. Of course we headed to the one with the longest queue which was Zhen Zhen porridge - there was so much ingredients jam packed in the porridge so we knew exactly why it was so popular. There was pork soup / Bak Ku Teh; lor Mee; roti Prata; Ipoh Hor fun; oyster Hokkien Mee. We ate and ate and things were cheap. Even the drinks stall was unique because they had almond tea which was unusual. Truly enjoyable.
,,Quality Cheap Food,4.0,,"The hawker market eating experience is part of the Singaporean culture. The Hawker Centre is a great example of this. The night we attended it wasn't fully open but there were enough stalls open for us to sample the wares.

We started with some delicious satay sticks from 'Wonderful'. Pork, chicken and mutton sticks with a delicious satay sauce. 10 sticks, sauce and rice for under $7. Then it was 8 pork fried dumplings for $4 from Special Shanghai Tim Sum. Absolutely delicious.

To finish we shared a fantastic Thai Green Curry and rice for $4.50. Add a cold beer and a coke for another $4.50 and for around $20 we fed two people with great food, just as memorable as the expensive restaurants we have attended here.

Give the hawker centres a go, you won't be disappointed."
,,My favourite SUPPER place after clubbing !!,4.0,,"This place is definitely one of those places which I will always visit every weekend when I'm in singapore, because this place always open until late, and usually after clubbing , i just walked to this place around 3-4 pm, and they still have those porridges , and some noodles to eat, and some others super delicious foods !!! LOVE LOVE LOVE !!!"
,,Great spot without pretensions.,4.0,,"Exactly as portrayed on many television features. Wander around until you find something that catches your fancy, order it and sit down and enjoy. Absolutely within everyone's budget."
,,True local experience,5.0,,"You have to visit this centre to get the true feeling of singapore,dont be put off by the lack of hygiene remember this is singapore and hawkers centres are not 5 star eataries but in my opinion food is fantastic and the atmosphere is truely local,just take a seat with the locals and enjoy"
,,Typical hawker food venue,3.0,,"It's always worth finding the local hawker food markets to eat in and Maxwell Hawker centre is worth going to if you're in the area. Good range of foods, when we went a long queue for tasty Hainan Chicken Rice, go early for char kway teau and sip fresh coconut milk or freshly squeezed iced lemon juice or a beer while you wait. Follow the locals for tasty food and you won't go wrong in Singapore!"
,,Cheap excellent food,5.0,,Hawker centers are the best choice for eating in Singapur. There is a lot of different dishes available and the prices are affordable. A must see in Singapure. It closes around 9pm so if you come late many stalls are closed.
,,Touristy with some great food,4.0,,"Frequent by independent tourists due to the good reviews of some well known stalls, this hawker centre in a central area has a number of stalls that serve very good food but are somehow not in the limelight. Good for the ever popular chicken rice (no offense to Anthony Bourdain but DFF is my pick), ngoh hiang, fish soup and a one-of-its-kind stall selling tasty deep-fried tapioca balls."
,,Lunch at the Maxwell Hawker Centre,4.0,,Our tiur guide provided us with oltions for dining at the centre and so we tried the famius chicken and rice with cucumber with black sauce. The chilli sauce was apparently quite hot.
,,Qiang ji hainanese chicken rice,5.0,,"I bet this the only chicken rice stall that is not in blue signboard. Indeed the special one, chilli is spicy and rice is fragrance enough to have additional portion. Soya sauce in the tender chicken is what we called perfection. A Must Try in this food centre"
,,"Good food , good price.",4.0,,"This food court has many local stalls that you could taste. The price also reasonable. However, the tables are always full in meals time."
,,Food...,4.0,,Maxwell Food court isn't far off Temple street.Isolated from the China town.A place worth having a meal. Worth a try.
,,Nothing special,3.0,,"A more tourist friendly and thus expensive HC. No reason to go to Maxwell if you're not looking to pose next to Anthony Bourdaine. It's not bad, just very average in food and maybe 10-20% more expensive than less known places in the neighbourhood. More drunk Australians than in any other HC I've visited."
,,Cheap as chips - very like street food,4.0,,"This is a really interesting place to go to, dirt cheap and just great to observe. We had satays and drinks and the food was very good. A lot of the shops close by 8pm, but you can still get lots of types of food and beverages."
,,nice food,4.0,,"Lot of food, but long waitting. Tian Tian Hainan Chicken rice is here. This place is so busy between 11.00 am till 3 pm,"
,,"Cheap, clean and full of varieties",4.0,,"Maxwell Road Hawker Center is centrally located within the central business district just opposite China town beside the Maxwell Road URA Center. When you visit Chinatown or attractions nearby, do remember to drop by this hawker center to try the specialties over here. Hawker food is unique in Singapore culture and they are cheap, hygienic, delicious and full of varieties.

The NEA (National Environment Agency) officers take responsibility and exercise due diligence to ensure each stall comply with the high standard of cleanliness and hygiene set for them. Any little complaint on the food hygiene or cases of food poisoning when substantiated may result in the eventual suspension or revocation of the respective stall license. The hawker stalls are also rated according to their hygiene or cleanliness standard.

Each hawker center has their unique specialties dishes. I like the Rojak and Duck rice at Whampoa Food Center, I like the rice kwek, the ice-kacang dessert at Ghim Moh hawker center, the prawn noodles at Holland Village hawker center and for this Maxwell Road hawker center, the reputed dishes include the Tian Tian Hainanese chicken rice, the Thai cuisine, the peanut and Tao Suan sweet dessert, the fish ball noodles, the Fu Zhou Oyster Cake.

When I was there early in the morning at about 9 am, not all the stalls are open for business and the stall patrons are not limited to the locals who worked at the banks, Chiinatown and other financial institutions but I also saw Caucasian tourists frequenting the breakfast buns stall and the Thai food stalls. The vegetarian stall and the roti prata stalls also attracted quite a queue of locals.

Singapore is a food paradise and hawker food are part of our unique food culture. You can embark on a culinary trail sampling all the unique food in the hawker centers especially in this part of the central business district."
,,Chicken rice over-rated,3.0,,"There is a restuarant inside this Hawker Centre famous for Chicken rice. The queue was long, I ordered a whole chicken, vegetable and few portion of rice.
The taste of the chicken is just average, if I have to compare, chicken in Bangkok is much better, this one seems too fat.
Rice is good, vegetable has no taste, so I guess probably they are too busy and food becomes average."
,,Lots of great food but beware of the crowds,5.0,,"My office building is located in front of this hawker centre here is an everyday affair. There are a number of well known stalls here offering great selection of food. However, the lunch time crowds and long queues are a put-off."
,,"Complete hawker food complex, 24 hours",4.0,,This hawker complex offer complete variation of foods and drinks. There are several a well known stalls like chicken rice. Most of the food are delicious. And it offer 24 hour services for selected store
,,"Maxwell Food Centre, Singapore",4.0,,"Maxwell Food Centre is famous because there are many local shops and many local menues. Local people and tourists come here. It completely opens from 11.00 a.m. but some shop open from morning.
You can have Tofu, egg tart, soya bean, Mee, Zhen Zhen Pork Porridge, Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice, Rojak Popiah and Cockle, Wu Xiang Guan Chang and etc. that start with 1 SGD (dessert) and 3.5 SGD (main dish).
From MRT Chinatown station you walk pass ""Sri Mariamma Temple"" ""Buddha Tooth Relic"" and cross the road you will see the Maxwell on Maxwell road.
From MRT Tanjong Pagar you would exit to Maxwell road."
,,Late-night suppers,4.0,,"Located in the city, this centre is great during the day but also very convenient for late-night suppers. Try the chicken porridge where each order is cooked individually. Other stalls offer a range of snacks, noodles, hot/cold drinks -- enough choice for supper although not all stalls are open."
,,Amazing seafood eggs noodles,3.0,,"Have been there some times, have a lot of kinds of street food. Always crowdy. Quite clean. Not expensive. Last year Gordon Ramsey was here to compete with the best noodle maker of Chinatown. Worth a visit. ."
,,My favorite hawker center in Singapore,5.0,,"We been to about all of them, but maxwell is our favorite. Very clean and a wide diversity of food and drink. Famous chicken rice stall, look for the que!"
,,What an amazing place !,5.0,,This is the place to come if you want to sample high quality food at reasonable prices. There are so many stalls to choose from and you really are spoilt for choice. There are even stalls serving a wide range of western dishes for those less adventurous. It can be busy and sometimes the queues can get a bit long - due to the food being prepared fresh to order - but it really is worth it !
,,Interesting stalls a little different from usual hawker centres,4.0,,"As Chinatown is famous for its Cantonese population and food, it is no surprise that the food served at stalls here is of a higher standard than elsewhere. The famous Tian Tian chicken rice is here but the very long queues are discouraging so one may do well to save time by trying its competitors nearby as chicken rice all over Singapore is of a reasonable quality. Ah Tai who used to work for Tian Tian has a stall nearby which some prefer over the original!
There are newer stalls like the Eurasian-Peranakan one helmed by a brother-sister duo. It is said to have great ayam buah keluak. I was only able to try the Eurasian beef smore with chap chye accompaniment ($6 I think for the set) and a saucer of delicious sambal (their own recipe). Portions are generous. The babi ponteh set had been sold out and it was only about 1.30pm. The lunch crowd is overwhelming as many office workers in the area come here but you can share tables."
,,One of the Best Hawker Centres in Singapore,5.0,,One hundred open air stalls preparing and selling some of the tastiest and most economical Chinese food in Singapore. This Hawker Centre is located on the edge of Chinatown. There's also a fair amount of Western food for less-than-daring tourists.
,,Don't come too late!,4.0,,"Most of the ""food houses"" are closing around 8:30-9 pm so you shouldn't come too late if you want to have different choices. Otherwise, good juices (especially passion fruit- pineapple, yummy!!) and good food for cheap! :)"
,,Must Try Local Food,5.0,,"Excellent Food Choices and pricing. If you want to try out local food, this is a must visit food court."
,,Worth a Visit,5.0,,We came here for dinner. My husband lined up for 20 minutes for the famous Hainese Chicken Rice. Was his favourite meal in Singapore. The children had satay sticks and devoured them. I loved the $2.50 fresh juices.
,,Hawker centre,5.0,,"Excellent hawker centre, eat with the locals. Warning, the laksa is totally addictive! Watch where the locals que, thats generally the best place!"
,,yuuummm!!,5.0,,so delicious and cheap. going back again to try something different. my meal cost me only $4 and i think that is the average price for a meal. so much to choose from and can walk here from china town MRT station. on your walk stop of at the Sri Miriamman temple
,,Anything you want,5.0,,"Nice place for a quite decent meal among office workers, there are not many tourists. You can choose from every little store in there and then share a table with them and, in my case, they were happy to recommend places to visit in their town."
,,Favorite Hawker Center in Singapore,5.0,,"We came here for dinner twice while we visited Singapore, and out of all the hawker areas we visited, we liked this one the best. It had the best spread of different kinds of food and good choices at that. I even found a Taiwanese hawker stall there (we'd just come from Taiwan and I already missed the food there) so I was pretty excited about that. The food is very good there and incredibly cheap (especially compared to say, Orchard Road) so it's a nice option if you're on a budget while visiting Singapore. If you only decide to visit one hawker center while here, this would be my suggestion."
,,Oyster cakes,4.0,,Some of the stands at the Maxwell Road Hawker Centre have existed for decades. One of these is the Oyster cake stand. These are worth a trip on their own. I also very much enjoyed the juice stand where I could get a fresh soursop and passion fruit combo. I was at first put off by the fluorescent lights that make the atmosphere in the evening less appealing.
,,Great place for fast and cheap food,4.0,,Cheaper than China Town Food Court and just round the corner. Should try the chicken rice and banana fritters! Quick and easy. Cheapest food you can buy
,,"Favourite place! This is singapore, affordable, delicious and friendly!",5.0,,"Avoid the tourist gouging places. Go to Maxwell. Choose something tasty looking, ask someone who looks like they are friendly and know what they are doing for a recommendation. Grab a delicious fruit juice of some sort!
More than once at a Hawker I got the community and welcoming feel that even the fancy hotel with their 'superior' service couldn't provide. As a person along, I just sat at a table and hope someone joins me -- usually they do if you look not intimidating! It's a fabulous way to get to know the city. yum yum..."
,,Great Value for Various Foods,4.0,,"My husband and I wanted to grab a quick dinner from here on our first night in Singapore during our honeymoon. It was a short walk from our hotel so we decided to check it out, but since it was late in the evening, a lot of the stands in the center were already closed. We ended up getting BBQ chicken and rice from one of the stands, and it was delicious and cheap! The only downside is it can be hard to find seating, tables are small and sometimes dirty, and the seats are backless stools. But if you don't mind the bustling, budget atmosphere, it's a great meal at one of the few reasonably-priced places in Singapore!

I had also visited here in September 2011 and had the soup dumplings (Xiao Long Bao) from one of the stands per my friends' recommendations. They were delicious (and cheap as well)."
,,Cheap and delicious,4.0,,"Arrived in time for lunch was worth the humid walk from our nearby hotel. Food was delicious and we only spent about $10 for the 2 of us and were full.
Good vibe here to sit and eat. Was quite a nice temp once sat down with the fans going but you can also get take away.
A must do when in Singapore"
,,Famous Hawker Fod Centre,4.0,,"Our hotel was 2 minutes away and we came here for breakfast every day. There is a fantastic range of stalls and a week was not long enough to try any more than a handful of the offerings. The centre features the Gordon Ramsay recommended Tian Tian (Hainanese chicken rice) and Zhen Zhen porridge. A good idea is to get a tray, buy from stalls that have a queue and then share the goodies between you.

Our other favourites were the juice drinks (particularly from 848), pancakes, banana fritters, toast with kaya (coconut jam), peanut soup and chicken porridge."
,,Don't go on Sunday night ....,4.0,,"This place is very close to china town , just cross the street, it seems to me that Sunday evening is not a good time to visit the place ... Almost all the stalls where closed.
But I did had a chance to try the chicken and rice ... Delicious, at any stall , don't forget to have a coconut for drinking...."
,,nice food,4.0,,had dinner there and the dishes were so delicious. had a pleasant time thereat whereby the service was up to the expected standard and the prices were also down to earth. surely will go there on my next visit

,,Fun Dining experience,4.0,,This was a huge pavilion with hundreds of stalls to choose what to eat - Very cheap and freshly made and Well worth a visit for lunch -a short Walk from Chinatown-most enjoyable!!
,,Average food but a bit over-rated,3.0,,"There is a great variety of food to choose from. Overall, the food is average and salty. It is hot to eat in the food court as it is not air-conditioned."
,,Spoiled for choices,5.0,,"I know everyone would be going to Maxwell Hawker Centre to have the renowned Tian Tian Chicken Rice, but you all have to try the Ondeh Ondeh which is a traditional Malaysia Kuih. It is made up of glutinous rice balls filled with gula melaka and cover with coconut on the outside, i do not quite recall the location of the stall but do keep a lookout because the ondeh ondeh would be sold out within 2 hours right after its made.Not to forget the Lor Mee stall next to Tian Tian Chicken Rice, i have tried the Signature Lor Mee the one that cost $5 it was probably one of the best Lor Mee out there. For those of you who do not know what is Lor Mee its served in thick gravy and yellow flat noodles with few slices of pork belly, egg maybe wanton depending on what you order."
,,Cheap food in the CBD area,4.0,,"Located dnear Tanjong Pagar MRT, this food court offers one of the most reasonable food at a reasonable price. There are a lot of famous stalls around here. Choose your pick."
,,Great selection,4.0,,Good selection of food and drinks for everyone's tastes. Great fresh juices there are a couple to choose from but very fresh
,,Cheap food in the CBD area,5.0,,One of the best place to have your meals. The place is filled with variety of stalls selling local delicacies. The easiest way to spot the food is to see which stall has the longest queue during lunch time. One of the best stall is the Tian Tian Chicken rice. A must try i must say.
,,Yum,5.0,,"Plenty of food and drink choices.
We went there for the famous Chicken Rice (which is a must by the way) and ended up ordering from other stalls as well. They were all good.

There's construction ongoing near the front of Maxwell road so the entrance is a little blocked, but there are directional signs posted along the way."
,,SO IN LOVE,5.0,,"I came here everyday I was in Singapore and I still could not get enough.. There is just so much variety, and everything is so cheap. Yeah it's not so clean and you have to be alittle brave to try new things but it is so worth it. Not once did I have a bad meal here. It's a nice mixture of locals and tourists, you definitely get an authentic experience!"
,,Lots of choices,5.0,,The hawker center has lots of choices and is a great place to sample local food. It is also close to Chinatown so it is convenient to go Maxwell for food before or after waking around Chinatown.

,,Must visit for Chicken rice,4.0,,All i can say about this place is that if in China town this hawker center is a must visit for their Hainanese Chicken rice which I am told is a must eat when in Singapore.
,,Hawker Centre,4.0,,"Nothing fancy but the food is inexpensive and very good homemade. People are friendly and happy to give you more or less chili. Laksa, satay, nearly every Asian dish you could wish for."
,,Should definitely visit but bring a fan,5.0,,This is definitely the place to visit as it was such a eye opener! Tons of eateries to choose from but it can be really hot especially without air conditioning. You can walk round the whole place and decide on what you want to eat. I can certainly recommend the hainan chicken and satay. You will need to purchase drinks from other vendors. Extremely reasonable and much better than some of the restaurants
,,"I liked the fact that it is an old food court, but the food was average.",3.0,,"I liked the fact that it is an old food court, but the food was average. It was hot and humid and service was average. Perhaps I went with extremely high hopes, but didnt find it as good as expected"
,,Usual lunch,4.0,,"Whenever I am in Shenton Way, Maxwell Food will be my first option. It does get crowded around lunch time because of the numerous office buildings and the variety of food options to choose from. Some of my favourites would be Hainanese Chicken Rice, Sambal Blachan Fried Rice, Popiah and Chinese Rojak. Of course, the prices are cheap for the quality."
,,Variety is the spice of life!!!,4.0,,Loved this lace .... we were in Singapore for a day waiting for flight and visited this place for lunch. And weren't we glad we did. The variety of food was amazing and so reasonably priced. All the Hawker Stands are rated for cleanliness so no worries there just try and pick the A & B stands. I had a Mixed Meat Plate which included BBQ Duck and Pork with Rice and sauce. Just so tasty and only $3.50. None of us had a complaint about the food and we were even able to get a beer there to cool us down. Would highly recommend
,,Various of food.,4.0,,Like a school canteen where is everything easy to find. Many delicious food is served here. Nice location just a minute walk from mrt China town. The price is reasonable.
,,Excellent street food great variety,4.0,,we visited Maxwell Road Hawker Centre in China Town in Singapore.Its a short walk from China Town MRT.There is a great variety of food and the beer is cheap and cold.We purchased a book on street food when at the Singapore Museum so you can read about the various dishes and get a better understanding of what each dish contains.If you after an upmarket restaurant then Maxwell Street is not for you.There is a variety of dishes from various countries and you can pick different dishes from different shops.There are table and chairs in the court yard and cleaners come by and clean up
,,Variety of food,4.0,,"There are many different type of food and drink to choose. The place is clean and you can enjoy many local food. Furthermore the price is fair for the hawker center. I took my dinner there for the consecutively for 5 days, tried 5 different meal... Chicken rice, claypot noodles, wan tan noodles......"
,,China Town,4.0,,Maxwell Road Hawker Centre in China Town Area of Singapore is very Good to fill your Hungry tummy with mouth watering delicious Foods of Different Nations under a single roof. Just opposite to Budha Tooth Relic Temple the Food served here is very Cheap and Good. You get much 2 more than you spend.Lovely Food is Chicken Rice with one or more pints of Tiger Beer. Must visit to have a taste of variety of Foods.
,,Cheap but having an exaggerated reputation,4.0,,"Many people recommended the ""Tin Tin Hainan Chicken Rice"" to me. I think it's cheap (around SGD 4.5 for chicken legs rice)and quality is quite good. Especially for the rice, it tastes good and have a nice smell. However, if you specially visit Maxwell Road Hawker Centre for this, it may be not that valuable."
,,Amazingly busy at lunch time,4.0,,"After walking from Chinatown station we were thirsty and ready for bite to eat, and a pint of Tiger.
There are multiple eateries cooking on the spot meals which you carry to a table if you can find one! Fantastic selection of range of Far Eastern foods, Chinese, Singaporean noodles,Indian and to round it off a fritter fryer for lovely banana fritters."
,,"Cheap & Good , Varities with Value",4.0,,"Be healthy while you eat@ Go for tbe Cheap n healthy fruit juices & varities!
Love chicken rice there are few stalls .
My fravourites, homemade cuttle fish ball noodles n satay bee hoon( rice noddle with veggie,pork,cockcles, dry fried tofu, prawns top with satay sauce).
Must try the store at a corner the Eurasian Peranakan stall one of the best ayam buah keluak really home cooking not mass production quality.
Dont forgetenjoy"
,,Spoilt for choice,5.0,,Now I do love my local food being an expat. So when I was recently in SG I had to try Maxwell food centre. The highlight was definitely the CKT from the Marina South stall. OMG was it good or what. I could have had seconds. The Tien Tien stall was very popular too but I did not get to try it. Next trip. Only downside wS the lack of ceiling fans or some air conditioning but the you would loose the atmosphere.
,,Okay,3.0,,Good variety look for where the queues are to decide where to eat reasonably clean lots of variety to choose from frequented by locals and tourists
,,"Decisions, decisions",5.0,,"Wow, what to choose! So many stalls here and the prices are out of this world. If you want a cheap feed and tasty and clean this is the place but don't get there too late as if a stallholder has sold out their food they close. Chose nasi goreng, spring rolls and chicken rice and was great. Was told that the best food was where the longest queue was but wanted something else. About 5 mins away from Chinatown and at half the price."
,,Grat PitStop for lunch if in the Chinatown district,5.0,,"Maxwell Hawker Centre replicates an outdoor covered food market. Somewhere to sit in the shade and enjoy many of Singapores famous dishes - Hainese Chicken, Chilli Mud Crab and Carrot Cake (actually a savory dish... tasty but not at all what you expect). Grab a bite and a fresh squeezed Barley juice and chill.

Tip1: dont go before 11am as most stalls will be still setting up for lunch, but try to beat the lunch crowd.. this is a local fave for nearby workers.
Tip 2: dont be disheartened if you cant find an available table to sit at, you can sit at a table with others if the seats aren't taken. This is normal practice!"
,,Nice Hawker Center,4.0,,Good place to try Singaporean hawker food. Many food stalls that offer variety of foods from Chinese to Indian food. The famous Hainanese Chicken Rice Tian Tian is there. The place is within 10 minutes walking distance from Chinatown MRT station. Place of interest nearby are the Hindu temple and Chinese Temple. Clean and tidy. The food price is standard and reasonable.
,,Stalls with goodies to eat relatively cheaply by Singapore standards,4.0,,"A short walk from the main China town restaurants and stalls lies a very large warehouse, within it are 100's of stall selling delightful Chineese wares to eat, juices to drink. We were told to go where you see the longest queues - it will be worth the wait. And it was! We drank Jelly nut/green coconut juice and ordered roast duck from one of the stalls selling only roast duck, ribs [beef I think] and other roast items with rice. it was delicious. Apparantly it is packed at lunch times - we were there for about 3pm and a lot of stalls were shut. An experience not to miss!"
,,Everything Also Got Lor,5.0,,"My Singaporean friends reckon this in one of the best hawker centres in Singapore. There's a great selection, it's very inexpensive by Singaporean standards. Of course it is spit and sawdust compared to formal restaurants but this is essentially a sanitised version of a street full of food stalls. It's great."
,,Excellent hawker with great choice,4.0,,"Made sure I squeezed in a visit to this hawker centre when visiting and was not disappointed. I tried the infamous tian tian hiainese chicken rice but just wished I was staying longer to try more of the specialities. The chicken rice was excellent, am really pleased I went out of my way to find this place. Huge variety of different juices as well.
Excellent value for money and very authentic given the number of locals.
Many of the stalls are only open for lunch or until they sell out so bear this in mind if planning a visit for dinner."
,,Great and delicious choices,4.0,,You can't seem to go wrong here. Try the duck noodles from the stall in the centre row where all the roast ducks are hanging up - amazing marinade and sauces. The fried dumplings from the dumpling store on the road side of the centre are also fab.
,,Had a great little supper here,5.0,,Well after visiting it 10 years ago it is still the same vibrant and diverse venue for dinner! Everyone was so sweet and we tried a red dragon fruit and pineapple juice shake which was delicious! The dim sum dumplings across from the fruit shake stall was just as helpful and delicious! A must do in Singapore
,,Best hawker in town,5.0,,Living now for several month on Singapore. Maxwell keeps me alive. Good prices and various stalls. Still discovering new ones. During day and lunch super busy and dinner some more tourist but all fine. Must see during Singapore stay.
,,Must try,5.0,,"Now this is place you should try. The food courts are where locals come out to eat and this one is a very popular lunch place.

There was an amazing choice to try and we were truly pampered. The place was clean and vendors were friendly.

Expect long queue and be open-minded about food choices. There are lot of Durian based desserts. they might be offensive to some. Even we hated the smell, but tried it any way."
,,Heaven for Singapore Local Food,4.0,,Great Chicken rice and other local foods to savour!! I had a nice delicious set of Hainanese chicken rice for my lunch and surprisingly it cost for only S$ 3.50. Best Food Centre in Downtown Singapore in my humble opinion.
,,Great local food,5.0,,"great place to have early am breakfast. Especially enjoyed the Portage. Recommend the small size which is ample. Also, try tapioca dumplings... Real good"
,,Quality deteriorated. But still ok for local food.,3.0,,"Went with my mum to reminisce the nostalgic past of tasty local hawker food. But we were quite disappointed.
The old stalls are still around while there are new stalls too.
The long Qs for popular stalls are still there. But the quality seems to have deteriorated. I don't think I will be back there anytime soon.
It's now a tourist hub. Possibly better off at other hawker centers..."
,,Lim Kee banana fritters,4.0,,"visited Maxwell food court on a resent visit to Singapore what a great place to eat.
Very affordable with so many choices, the banana fritters from Lee kee:s stall are just so yummy you cant stop at one and an excellent way to finish off a top meal"
,,Limited food stalls during evening,3.0,,Very limited food stalls open in the evening. Chicken wings were ok while a generous portion for a sgd3 char kuey teow. Prefer food at Newton Circus compare to here
,,U.S. mall food courts wish they could be like this!,5.0,,"Anthony Bourdain ate here in the Singapore episode of ""No Reservations"", and he sampled Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice, as did I, and I enjoyed it immensely. It is a flavorful combination of boiled spring chicken and white rice, with various dipping sauces available. There are many other stalls here serving Chinese, Malay, Indonesian, and other Southeast Asian cuisines, plus I had the chance to drink a kiwi/ dragonfruit juice combo, which was a great thirst quencher given the tropical climate! U.S. mall food courts pale in comparison to the Singaporean hawker centres, they are too bland and one-dimensional. There's not many places in this world where you can get a satisfying meal for under $10 USD, and even the food courts in Stateside malls charge more than that and don't give you the variety that a hawker centre does. Hawker centres are a must visit when you come to Singapore!"
,,È¶ôÊ∏ØÊ®ôÊ∫ñÔºåÂçÅÂàÜÊôÆÈÄö,3.0,,"Just ok la. In Hong Kong standard, this hainanese chicken rice is just really average. I can't understand why tourists will flock into this restaurant. Come to Hong Kong. You can easily find a lot better hainanese chicken rice."
,,Good food at great prices,4.0,,"It is said that Singaporeans love to eat. Hawker centers are a great place to find lots of local food with some even having Japanese, Korean and other cuisines, all at very reasonable prices.

You can go for breakfast, lunch, dinner or even supper and you will definitely find some stalls open. It can get very crowded during lunch time when you will find throngs of office staff there for their meal.

Even tourists are finding this place a 'must try'. Try avoiding the peak hours and you should have a better experience.

Some of the more popular outlets include Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice as well as Zhen Zhen Porridge."
,,Best Chicken Rice In All Of Singapore,5.0,,"The Maxwell Hawker Centre is a must for tasting the famous Singapore Chicken Rice. The cuisine is inexpensive but well prepared and very tasty. The food vendors are rated by the government. Each occasion I visited I joined the longest line of queing customers. A. The food is excellent, B. Very cheap or C. Both."
,,Great hawker centre,4.0,,"I had read about this place in the lonely planet, and when the hotel reception staff suggested we ate there we knew we would be in for a treat. Some authentic dishes are on sale from a variety of vendors. Dont go expecting fine dining, but for some honest local food, Maxwell Road is a must."
,,Best Hainan Chicken,5.0,,"I only found out about this place reading the inflight magazine on the flight to Singapore and am very glad I did. I went their my first night and had the most incredible dinner for $4.50. It was worth a lot more than that. Incredible flavours, generous servings, fresh and delicious."
,,Simple,3.0,,Simple food and very cheap. The place I ate at - not sure it has a name was quite good. Walk around and see what people are eating and if it looks OK sit down and enjoy.
,,Hiananese Chicken,5.0,,"Excellent food and very cheap - dinner was all of nine dollars! Go to the Tien Tien stall....you won't be disappointed. Fresh, unpretentious and very satisfying - zip down to Smith Street beers to wash it down with one of their fabulous beers on tap (chinatown complex)."
,,Great Food,4.0,,"There are many great food here. Tourists should come here rather than go to Newton Hawker Centre where touts will rip you off on the seafood. Here at Maxwell is typically what the locals eat regularly (not the Newton seafood). Just join any long queue and you are guaranteed to have great food, just that you might not get used to it. Anyway it is a adventure."
,,Cheap food and local colour,4.0,,"I went here with an international work group for a pm evening meal. It was a great place to go - so many different types of food to try meant there was something for everyone in our group. Food seemed quite authentic local fare, and there were lots of Singaporean families eating their evening meal at the table, kids doing homework and grandmas minding babies. It was a very interesting and pleasant atmosphere. It felt very safe. The food and drinks were really cheap - a large meal of rice, veg and chicken, with some red bean patties for dessert, plus water for less than $7. Beers were also much more affordable here at around $6 ea when we have Ben paying double that at the hotel. Very clean public toilets there too.
It was a good entertainment to just wander around watching all the various vendors making their speciality, and to soak up the smells and sounds. It was very hot and sweaty though - we were there in October - so remember to drink plenty of water along with anything else you might be imbibing!"
,,Best place for Hainan Chicken,4.0,,"When in Singapore, I'm always walking past and so for a quick pit stop I recommend Maxwell. What I love about Maxwell Food centre is that after a fun night at the bars nearby you can always grab some food on at Maxwell"
,,Great Food,4.0,,We were a little earlier for lunch but that was okay as it wasn't crowded. Try the Fish Porrige - fantastic.
,,Amazing place to dine at.,4.0,,Went with two friends of mine on dinner to maxwell road hawker center after seeing all the reviews in tripadvisor but no infact I went there because of uniqueness of this restaurant. And trust me it was worth it.
,,Another large hawker style place to eat.,4.0,,"This is similar to the other large hawker centres to be found in the City and suburbs.
Offering undercover seating and the usual large variety of food and drink at reasonable prices.
We went with the family after visiting China Town as it right next door - so most convenient for a combined visit.
Another hawker style establishment to add to your list - but nothing exceptional."
,,Lots of great food hidden here,5.0,,"I did a bit of research online so that I could try the best food vendors. Overall, I had some really good food here. Surprisingly my favorite thing during my entire trip was the lady who sells porridge. It wasn't the porridge but actually her raw fish salad is delicious! I would hit up the Chicken Rice lady as well, look for the photo of Anthony Bourdain on her stall."
,,Locals Know Why,5.0,,I'm not a local but was lucky enough to have one calling THIS shot. Great Chicken Rice spot. Terrific options for lunch.
,,One of the best places to eat in Singapore,5.0,,"I have always liked buffets or smorgasbords as it is an excellent way to try a small bite of various foods. While Maxwell's is not a buffet, there are dozens of small individual stalls selling all kinds of Oriental foods, drinks, and desserts at some of the most affordable prices in all of Singapore. Basically, it is street food concentrated in a large building with plenty of seating as well as clean restrooms.

My wife and I decided to try a variety of dishes from different vendors, splitting whatever we ordered. We started out with a large bowl of hot and sour soup that was tasty but different with shrimp and squid inside. This was followed by two egg rolls, an order of tien tien chicken and rice, an order of Pad Thai, a stir fried chicken and vegetable dish we just pointed to from a picture on the wall, 10 pieces of chicken satay with an excellent peanut sauce, an iced coffee, and a special juice our son recommended we try. For dessert, we had six doughnuts that we fried ourselves in a huge wok using large wooden chopsticks. With the exchange rate, our total cost was about $14 US. We, and our wallets, left there full and happy."
,,Great variety of cheap eats,5.0,,"Very easy to find Maxwell Rd Hawker Centre (outdoor food court) as it's just a turn and street away from Chinatown MRT station. The hawker stalls line the middle while regular restaurants line the sides of the street. Highly recommended to eat here as the food is fresh, cheap and great variety.

A great variety of Singaporean, Malay, Chinese and Thai foods all in the $4 to $10 SGD range, with the average being $5.50. Meals generally don't include a drink so either bring your own, purchase it elsewhere or budget an additional $3 to $4 per person because cans, bottles and freshly made drinks are expensive here unlike the food.

Lunch time from 12 PM to 1:30 PM gets very busy with the tourist crowds. Recommend that you come around 1 PM to be able to get a seat. If you arrive too late past lunch, some stalls will give you food that they had already prepared earlier in anticipation of orders that didn't arrive."
,,One of the Best in Singapore,5.0,,"I love this place so much and you are blown away by the variety and cleanliness. We had breakfast, lunch and dinner here across our stay - at less than $A10 per person.

You can try all the traditional dishes such as Chicken Rice, Char Kway Teow, Rojak, Kopi plus beautiful fresh juices and affordably priced beer.

I recommend get amongst the locals and eat at this fantastic venue."
,,One of the better and more popular hawker markets,4.0,,"Hawkers markets abound in Singapore, although sadly this and other hawker centres are not as atmospheric as the good old days when, before health and safety legislation herded the food hawkers into purpose-built centres with purpose built stalls, hawkers pushed their mobile barrows to congregate in car parks and other spaces turning it into an oasis of light, delicious smells and bustling atmosphere. However, despite this ‚Äòprogress‚Äô they still offer a buzzing atmosphere and taste of Singaporean life. This is probably one of the most popular owing to its proximity to Chinatown (although Smith Street is in Chinatown itself). Like most other hawkers markets, there are many stalls offering a wide variety of foods, and depending on what you have and which stall you patronise the meal quality will vary ‚Äì some are excellent and some are good but nothing special - although I consider this one to be one of the better hawker markets. It is particularly good for chicken rice. The thing they all have in common is that they are great value with dishes at rock bottom prices.

The main area is under cover, and being invariably crowded it can get very warm. However, there is an open-sided stretch to one side which is cooler and more airy, but finding an empty and clean table can be difficult, so be prepared to share a table with others.

You will probably have to queue at most stalls (irritating, but always a good sign), and it is worth noting that stalls begin to close from about 8.30 onwards as they run out of chicken or their main ingredient, so I would advise getting there before 8.30pm at the latest."
,,Amazing Cheap Eats,4.0,,"I always choose a stall by how busy it is, I assume if the locals are queueing for it, then food must be good. I ordered a BBQ pork wonton noodle from one of the stalls and it was the best tasting BBQ pork I've ever had and it cost me less than $5 SGD! If you are fine with a no fuss meal & setting, then check out this place. The people were so friendly."
,,Incredible Value and such a wide variety,5.0,,"If you're new to Singapore you can't go past this place. I'd say there would be 50+ stalls selling all types of food from all of Asia. We ended up sharing a table with a local man, and we discovered new food, he was eating a incredible fresh salad of raw fish and zingy fresh vegetables. Go out on a limb and try something new you've never tried...only for a few $$."
,,Find the same food anywhere,3.0,,"The food was fresh but nothing special, this food can be found in many places over Singapore , I had the mix pork and rice and the hanien chicken, pork was good but was disappointed with the chicken, the place gets very crowded and the tables are very dirty covered in left overs and dirty dishes, don't expect to sit alone or in or group, u have to squeeze on a table with different people, some who are spitting on the ground , and chewing like a cow."
,,Amazing,5.0,,I would eat here everyday if I could. The chicken rice is delicious as is the popiah. Definitely worth a visit!! The only trouble may be finding a seat.
,,delicious food. great prices!,5.0,,"Maxwell is a fantastic hawkers. Always packed with locals, which is a great sign. My top picks are oyster cakes, prawn dumplings and curry puffs. All of these things were around 2 Singapore dollars, a bargain!! Try it,we ate there almost every day picking different bits and pieces and it was brilliant."
,,"Delicious food, amazing prices",4.0,,"When you are in Chinatown, be sure to go across the street and explore the wonders of hawker centers...chicken and rice, duck, and the list is long....a real food tasting experience...."
,,"great food, very hot",4.0,,"The heat under the roof was almost unbearable but the smell from all the different food stalls was so tempting.

,,"Great Value, many food choices",4.0,,"This is a hawkers style food courts, a short walk away from Chinatown. Here you can find many food stalls, from rice porridge, seafoods, to soups, ducks, dumplings, noodles, fried carrot cake, fruits juice stall and the famous Hainanese Chicken Rice. Most of the food are very good quality at a very affordable price. Its great to find somewhere to eat good quality food without breaking your budget. I highly recommend to try the AhTai Chicken Rice or the famous Tian Tian."
,,For Hainanese Chicken,5.0,,"Arrived early and not all open, still plenty of locals, and have always worked on the opinion that if it is full of locals it tend to be good. Plenty of Hiananese chicken outlets, but still plenty of otheres. Had Fragrant Soicy Beef coffee and Soursop juice and still came out at only $S10. Will visit again before I leave.."

,,Wide range of choices!,4.0,,A must visit if you're in Chinatown! Also you should try Tian tian's chicken rice! There are also a lot of beverages ad desserts to try here. There might be a lot of people eating here so don't be shy to share a table.
,,This should be your first food stop in Singapore,5.0,,"The food in these hawker stands are just as incredible as Anthony Bourdain stated in his ""No Reservations"" show. In fact, after watching his review it made me want to go to Singapore so bad and wow what an incredible experience! It's easy to see that Singapore ranks among the best in the international food scene. With USD you can pay little to nothing to have a truly amazing meal. Of course you'll want to try the famous chicken and rice, and then you'll want to go to the stands that have the steamed fish. Unfortunately I can't remember the names of the actual stands that I visited as I was there around August 2013 and also visited MANY of the stands to taste as much food as possible. If you're in Singapore DEFINITELY check this place out!"
,,best chicken rice,5.0,,"best chicken rice here so far in Singapore, no wonder they get award for halal of Singapore, cheap price and friendly service from the seller"
,,Great Hawker Centre,5.0,,"You must try hainan chicken rice in here. There's some stall sell it. But the best ones, is the one with long queues... if you find it.. definetely that's the stall i talk about.."
,,Smaller than expected,4.0,,"Smaller than expected is not a bad thing. It's just that I saw this Food Court on Bourdain and had the impression it was massive. It was not. It was totally manageable. Lots of fruit stands too, which I appreciated. A lot of variety. Some of the stands looked a bit more hygienic than others. But there was a great selection of Chinese dishes to try. The place was full of a lot of tourists, it seemed to me."
,,Favorite hawker!,5.0,,"During our stay we went to different hawkers everyday, twice a day. Although the food of most of the other hawkers were good and tasty, Maxwell wins on every level. We went for breakfast and a mid afternoon snack. The people were friendly, funny and very social. Maybe not the widest variety of food, but enough to try different types of dishes out; chinese, malay, japanese, thai and let's not forget fruit juices/shakes, soy bean everything. Had the best SG Hawker experience at Maxwell, while I'm not sure if I'll go back to SG, if I do, Maxwell will be my main spot."
,,Spoilt for choices !!!! simply stunning,4.0,,"Choice is endless.... endless array, great, wholesome and dirt cheap array cushiness. The only thin i did not see being sold was pizza!!
Tried the Wanton Noodles with char Sui Pork, Laksa and some fresh. Simple decadence.

A must do for Singapore. Having had food in its nearby cousin-street in Chinatown in Pagoda Road which pales into comparison.

A place you need atleast 2 or 3 visits to really enjoy and appreciate the array and depth of cuisine.

Very Local"
,,Mind blowing choice,5.0,,"After eating in many of the top restaurants in Singapore and spending vast amounts of money, this was a fantastic contrast. Great food and atmosphere at incredibly cheap prices. Buy your food and sit where ever you want."
,,I just keep coming back :),5.0,,"Hawker centers are legendary in Singapore and among these Maxwell Hawker Center, located in Chinatown, is the best for me. Not only cheap but it offers good food as well. After dining to some of the hawker centers in SG, I never tried others anymore and keep coming back to Maxwell. You just have to be there early as seats are easily taken.

I tried the Hainanese Chicken Rice (which costs only SG$2.5), Char kway teow, Bak kut teh and Oyster omelette from the different stalls inside the center. Want to know where to find the good stuff? Act like a local, go wherever the lines are :) enjoy!"
,,You'll love it,4.0,,"Authentic, loads of choice, great value, good portions and the whole place is exceptionally well organised and clean. You can not go past this place."
,,Vast array of food choices in a casual food court atmosphere,4.0,,"The Maxwell Food Centre is a half open-air half closed-air building with a vast array of Pan-Asian food delicacies set up in a food court style. You could pick from different cuisines such as Singaporean, Malay, Chinese, Indian, Thai, Vietnamese, Indonesian, etc. Food was great and cheap, you could get snacks, meals, and drinks, for only a few dollars! We had refreshing fruit shakes and delicious Hainanese chicken rice for lunch."
,,Definitely a must do,5.0,,"We were referred to the food court by the cabbie who drove us from the airport to our hotel. Everything he said about it was consistent with what we'd heard from other travellers and also with what we'd read on-line. Maxwell is situated adjacent to Chinatown and is easily accessible via two MTO lines. We tried 5 stalls and all of the food was amazing and it seemed everyone who'd ordered from other stalls were equally pleased with their choices There are long line ups at the most popular stalls (porridge, and a stall that was featured on Anthony Bourdais of CNN) so get there early if you can. For those who have concerns about eating at this type of facility, don't. The people are friendly, the food great, the prices unbeatable, and the variety exceptional. As an added bonus there's shopping in Chinatown before or after."
,,I Get Hungry Just Thinking About This Place Now!,5.0,,"I had my wallet stolen along my journey and was living on a limited cash existence which meant I had to eat at Hawker Centres instead of fancy restaurants & hotel buffets as I was used to in Singapore. What I can say is that I ate amazing food - especially the dumplings - at this Hawker Centre for very little money. I recommend you visit during the day to avail yourself of all stalls being open but there are still plenty open at night. The fresh juices are also delicious and healthy too. Do yourself a favour, feast at the Maxwell Road Hawker Centre whilst in Singapore. Don't bother with Newton Circus, it has become very expensive and lost it's 90's charm. Maxwell Road is the one and perfectly situated to continue on to Club Street!"
,,Give it a try!,5.0,,"Whether for morning teh terek and sweets or pancakes, or a lunch of chicken rice, or maybe even my favorite sugar cane juice with lemon, there is always something to try. The Indian pancakes (can't remember the name) and all the fresh juices, the pepper crab... oh man, where does it end?"
,,An amazing first meal,5.0,,We went here for our first lunch in Singapore and we will definitely be returning. We had a Lor Mee and the chicken rice dish and both were delicious!
,,"""Fair Ground Food Vendors""",2.0,,"Visited on 2/19/2105 during the Chinese New Year and only about a third of the vendors were open, but there were many, many folks walking around and eating. Walked around the entire place, read menus, and our party sampled teas, juices, pork, chicken, rice and noodles. Reminded me a bit of the truck/trailer/tent food vendors at county fairs. The prices were very reasonable ($2-$5 for a meal) and the food was tasty. Be prepared for the lack of US standard sanitary conditions (make sure your vendor has an ‚ÄúA‚Äù rating showing), handling of food (often 2-3 people hand prepare your meal), bones in your food (the bone in signifies a better tasting portion), and no napkins (locals bring their own, some vendors will give you a napkin if you ask for it)."
,,delicious,4.0,,"one of the better hawker markets in Singapore, Maxwell boasts some amazing finds! Cheap food in big portions! A good night out with great food in the middle of Singapore city! A must try."
,,"Great ""hawkers"" place",5.0,,"Large local hawkers place where you buy cheap food, beer, juices at various stands and eat in an open setting. Great place to go local and enjoy good food. Nothing fancy - but tasty!"
,,Does exactly what it says on the tin!,4.0,,"Numerous food stalls selling all the local specialities. At thai food from stand 80ish?. Very clean and easy access from Chinatown, was very busy at lunchtime, bag your table and choose your food. Drinks stalls selling large bottles of tiger at $7.50, combine this with a cheap rice dish or noodles, what more do you want in life, plus great people watching"
,,Go find Tien Tien !,4.0,,one of the best hainanese chicken and rice. I think they actually beat Gordon Ramsey from the Hell's Kitchen or something. Don't forget to buy the sugarcane with lemon drink from the opposite shop!
,,Local food centre,4.0,,"Great variety of local foods, cheap and tasty. Was very warm inside, so try sit on the outside aisle where you might get a breeze."
,,First time visitor,4.0,,"We visited the Maxwell Road Hawker Centre 3 times with our visit to Singapore. The food was cheap, I cannot believe how cheap Hawker centre are especially compared to the amount of money it costs for a plate of Chinese in Australia. The centre was clean, a little hot but that's just part of the experience."
,,Good Cheap Food if you are in the area,4.0,,"Variety of food stalls with plenty of dishes for choose from.
We went for the two longest ques of people and ordered what the locals ordered.
Its loud and warm in this place but its decent food the locals eat everyday in their lunch break.
The dishes are simple but they taste is delicous.
Don't go here and expect any fancy stylish food or specially decorated plates but if you are looking for honest simple food its the right place."
,,Slightly up-market Hawker Centre - good food,4.0,,"This place is busy at lunch-times, but you can still get good food at low prices: clearly local folk come here very often. As always, choose the stall with the longest queue of locals, it must be good if they are choosing it. Pretty noisy and sometimes rather warm, and when busy, finding a table space can be challenging, but the choice of cuisine is huge, and the food we had was fine. Local Kopi (very strong coffee made with condensed milk) is low cost and a very welcome way to finish the meal. Very convenient for Chinatown area."
,,Fantastic food and great value,4.0,,"We wandered up here after a few drinks. $4:50 each for a sensational Thai green curry and rice. That's very good value for money. The place is clean, the tables a regularly cleared and wiped and the toilets would put some Australian toilets to shame. Not to be missed."
,,Its cheap and good,5.0,,"Its cheap, its busy and its good . This is a no frills place where you can try good local specialities without breaking the bank. Many things here they do well. The chicken rice as everyone else can testify is great here . Its always fresh and dare i say it YUMMY."
,,Always good,5.0,,"Every time I'm in Singapore, I have to eat there at least two times during my stay, every option is good, always clean and very affordable, will definitely keep coming back!"
,,A different but delicious experience,5.0,,Along with hundreds of office workers we sat down and in the communal eating area and searched amongst the dozens of small food stalls for tasty dishes - and there were hundreds. Queues indicated the popular and hopefully best stalls. Some people ate quickly and abruptly walked away; others chatted with friends and had a social lunch. The Singaporeans are polite and friendly and we easily found a seat despite the huge numbers. Choosing food is really difficult - everything looks so interesting and is cooked on the spot. We had tried Smith Street a couple of years ago and this easily matched to for atmosphere. But I must confess some of the restaurants round the corner in the media and cultural area looked even better!
,,Have to get the chicken rice!,5.0,,"There are so many options that you can hardly go wrong. Be sure to get the chicken rice. Although the line may be long, the waits for the best one is always worth it"
,,Maxwell - the place to be!,5.0,,"Maxwell never disappointed me. Good cheap food, great coconut drinks, fast service, good vibes. Maxwell! Big time MAKAN! Breakfast, dinner, lunch, go to Maxwell in Chinatown!"
,,Try the Chicken Rice,4.0,,We came to the Maxwell Hawker Centre specifically fo the Chicken Rice (which was delicious) - but they Pork Buns here were probably the best we had in Singapore.
,,Very good local food,4.0,,"Definitely stop here for the authentic Indian prata. Also buy yourself a fresh fruit juice, there are many concoctions button I love the lychee juice."
,,Cheap and great food,5.0,,"Visiting Singapore you should always eat at the hawker center's. Real Singapore food, clean and cheap. This one was the best of them."
,,Budget Place for Eating at Chinatown.,4.0,,We had our first-day breakfast there. Many shop still close even it's about 9.00 a.m. Fried carrot cake is very delicious. Pork porridge is good taste.
,,Authentic local food,5.0,,"You can find all types of food here, from hainanese chicken rice, carrot cakes to laksa, all at a very cheap price (most meals are within ~S$5). The environment is tidy. The only bad thing is that it's not air-conditioned, so it can be very hot while eating. Anyway, it's one of the best place to eat like a local."
,,Much better than the restaurants,4.0,,Just follow the crowds and you won't go wrong. I queued for ages like a sheep behind everyone at the roast duck / pork place and was rewarded with a $4 plate of succulent roast meat authentically thrown at me by the vendor :-)
,,Amazing,5.0,,One of the most amazing food experiences. Every booth looked delicious and unique. Prices were incredible. Easy to try so many foods that we had never seen before without fear of cost or lack of sanitation due to the grading system on every stand. Could have eaten here every day of our trip without getting tired or repetitive. We tried four different hawker centers and this one is far and away the best. It attracts the tourists for a reason.
,,"Tasty food, great selection",5.0,,"A great hawker experience near Chinatown, just a short walk from the Chinatown tourist markets. Wonderful variety of dishes to choose from. Bustling and lively atmosphere. Low priced and tasty food. Try the Chicken-Rice from one of the hawkers with a long queue (ie Tian Tian), it's worth the wait. There is a little Thai hawker tucked away at one end that I also recommend. The fresh juice mixes are also excellent. Just be aware that you are given the correct change when paying, I was overcharged by one hawker and sadly it was not a mistake. I am sure that not all operate this way, but it pays to check."
,,Yummy food!,5.0,,"We arrived at 11.15 to avoid the lunch rush! Had the chicken rice from tian tian and the sugarcane juice from the stall opposite, mmm mmm!!"
,,Low price local goodness/ÂÆâ„Åè„Å¶„Åä„ÅÑ„Åó„ÅÑ„É≠„Éº„Ç´„É´„Éï„Éº„Éâ„Ç≥„Éº„Éà,4.0,,"We visited three times there during the stay. Easy access from MRT Chinatown.
This place is perfect for easy, low price yummy food to feel full.
When you go for lunch I would like to recommend to avoid lunchtime as it is full of office workers... They put their pocket tissues onto the tables to secure!

,,A weekly affair,5.0,,"The first thing that stands out about Maxwell food centre is the variety. Great food reflective of the Singapore culture and history at equally excellent prices. Don't expect fancy service but it's efficient, prompt and matches what you'd expect to pay for. Maxwell is located in a central location for work and for sightseeing."
,,Chicken Rice and Porridge,4.0,,"This place is famous for the famous chicken rice stall and the big fish porridge place. However, there are other interesting stalls as well like the oyster omelette aunty that can add tomatoes and some salad to this devil of a tasty treat. The sliced fish soup is good too and so is the japanese stall. Overall, something for everyone and after the renovation, has become cleaner."
,,Food and atmosphere great!,5.0,,"Visited here as a must see whilst in Singapore. We stayed in the Bugis area so hopped on the MRT (return tickets for 3 was S$9 approx) to Chinatown as referred to by others on here as the nearest station-spot on,thank you! After a short walk through various street vendors and down by the temple we were there. Its not much from the outside-kinda looks like big tin sheds, but inside it was bustling with atmosphere, people cooking, eating at the plastic tables and chairs, and others queuing at various units for food. I had to try the Hainanese Chicken rice and the ""Ah Tai"" unit was the only one the locals were queuing at so I joined in. The steamed chicken rice(with miso soup) was fantastic! Well worth a 5-10minute queue and a bargain at S$3.50 (about ¬£1.80!!). Again as recommended here by previous visitors, dont leave it till too late to get here because even at 7pm many units were closing/closed and by 8pm many more were closed."
,,Interesting Experience,4.0,,"Many stalls inside a big building, very cheap and, usually, good Asian food. The locals recommend mainly chicken rice. I liked specially freshly pressed fruit juices for 2-3 S$."
,,"Great food, colourful atmosphere",4.0,,"My fianc√© grew up eating from this establishment, so I was very keen to check it out. So much in fact that we raced here during our 3 hour layover in Singapore...

Let me say first up that we went there on New Year's Day, so not all stalls were open and we missed out of the world famous Chicken Rice. I'm sure this would be a 5 star review if we were there a week later.

The place is a small maze of individual stalls, each with a tight specialist range of fare. Aside from the Singapore favourites, the influences are Thai, Chinese and Malaysian. Samples of the food are on display in most cases, but your best bet is to follow the crowds to the popular stalls. Although it can take a while, the good ones are worth the wait.

Meals are very cheap and you can sample a few mains and have a drink for under S$15. My advice is be adventurous, you might find a new fave.....otherwise you can just push it aside and start again!"
,,Don't come too late to eat!,4.0,,"We arrived around 20:00 and found already most establishments closed. The ones that were open provided great quality food at very reasonable prices. The thing with hawker food is that the taste is usually excellent with all the fresh ingredients and sauces, however it's mainly based on ""simple"" ingredients meaning that it will mainly be the cheaper cuts of meats and fish. Also the comfort is obviously is not much to be expected. This place is located very near the Chinatown main street and easy to find! You have to try the food here, but again expect simple but perfectly cooked dishes at low prices."
,,So much food!,4.0,,"If you want a good hawker experience then this is the place. There are just rows and rows of eateries to choose from, it's hard to decide what to eat. It can get very crowded and hot but there is good seating. The food is cheap, tasty and satisfying. Not far from Chinatown (easy walk)."
,,"Good food, but painfully hot and sweaty! ;-)",4.0,,"The food was amazing ... had a superb green curry...

Everything looked pretty good and appeared to be cooked fresh/to order...

The only problem is that the fans are not even vaguely able to keep the centre cool... it is REALLY hot and sweaty...

Definitely worth a visit though - but don't expect to be able to go back to work afterwards, without taking a shower first ;-)"
,,"Great food, very large selection",5.0,,"Tons of options, the chicken rice, as expected , is exceptional. But there are more options, which are not only Chinese on the closer row to Maxwell. Nice Juice selection and fruit stands. And most important from all for 10 SGD you can eat a full meal with desert, and it will be one of teh best you had in town"
,,"Varieties, Cheap, Delicious",4.0,,"Wow! I love this hawker centre. Very authentic local food found here. Plenty of choices, varieties. Delicious and very cheap, too. So many stalls of hainanese chicken rice, just don't know which one to choose from. There's one very obvious...long Q. The authentic local hainanses coffee (Kopi) was FANTASTIC !! Love it so much, had 3 cups of it before I go. Within walking distance of Chinatown, too. I would recommend this place if you are on budget n love local delicacies."
,,Good local hawker fare,4.0,,"From the main course to desserts you can savour our local fare under one roof.

Lunch time is crowded as the office crowd will be there.

From our infamous white chicken rice to char kuay teow
( flat white and yellow noodles) fried in the heavenly pork lard (which is not good for our cholesterol and a no no for people who diet) mixed with sweet black sauce or chilli with egg, cockles, bean sprout, fish cake and Chinese sausages saut√©ed in a hot fiery wok - yum - hungry ...... Visit Maxwell hawker centre to indulge in variety of S'pore fare.

To complete your meal try the different Kueh Kueh ( cakes) steamed tapioca coated in fresh grated coconut.

The highlight of this place is the infamous Han Chim Pian - deep fried dough which is only sold for 20 cts for a sweet bean or savoury saltish one. By courtesy of her dad it was sold very cheap @ 10 cts for many years ... Your inexpensive labor is required by helping this passionate dough maker flip the dough in hot oil so that it will be brown and crispy. The long queue of ardent fans are busy flipping so that you can collect your orders soon. Try it and you will be thankful and will not hesitate to return to be involved and ultimately enjoying the savory piping hot dough.

After a heavy meal, Chinatown is within walking distance."
,,Real local food,4.0,,If you want honest local food from around Asia then this is your place. The chicken rice is perfect. If going for lunch get there early before the local office workers arrive as it does get busy.
,,What's happened to Maxwell?,2.0,,"I took two foreign visitors promising them a Saturday night of trying multiple cuisines. We were very disappointed.

7pm on a Saturday, more than 70% of the hawkers were closed. The one open satay stall had a 45 minute wait time. There were still queues at The famous Hainanese Chicken Rice stall, but the remaining stalls that stayed open only served drinks.

There was a time this was a great night out. I hope this was just a blip as Smith Street across the road was very busy, so it's not a lack of patrons.

I will go back to Lau Pa Sat when I have guest from overseas. Although more 'touristy,' at least there are stalls open!"
,,Singapore version of fast food stalls,3.0,,"We chose one place at random, this is just across the street from the Chinatown area and was very convenient and a variety of food to choose from at reasonable prices."
,,Authentic!,5.0,,Get away any fear to Street food markets. This food court is a wonderful way to enter into daily local gastronomy at affordable prices.
,,An ok place to eat,3.0,,"Visited this place on a early Sunday evening. Not so crowded but a number of stalls will closed. Tried the chinese rojak and po piah. Not bad, typically the rojak which comes with thick prawn paste. The fried prawn noodle tasted no good, too salty , like pre-cooked."
,,Nothing special,3.0,,Not worth the trip. I may not know a better alternative place for local food. But I do know the food was below average.
,,Great!!,5.0,,"It's not far from our hostel, just 5 minutes walk from my place and a lot of food we can spend time long day to try many thing here."
,,Best Food In Chinatown,5.0,,"The Maxwell hawker center is a delight for anyone that enjoys food. There are many stalls offering different meals each one better than the other. The most famous one is the Tian Tian stall no 10 that serves a delicious Singaporean Chicken Rice. It's become a famous stall because Anthony Bourdain went there but its worth the hype. It's also one of the cheapest meals you'll eat as it's fairly inexpensive.

To read more check out www.thetinytaster.com"
,,Good food,4.0,,Love the rojak and the popiah in this place (this is in one stall). Tian Tian chicken rice is also a popular place to get Hainan chicken rice but unfortunately every time I came they always run out so they close early. There is also a char kway teow stall that sells excellent char kway teow with cockles and carrot cake.
,,Very basic,2.0,,"There are a lot of small shops, and for sure you could find all kinds of Singapore, Indian, Thai food there. BUT they are all just simply street food, cheap and fast, that's it. Don't expect it to be anywhere near the a restaurant or even a mid-level food court in shopping mall. It is just cheap, small portion, and poorly prepared/cooked."
,,Good selection but can get busy at lunchtime,4.0,,"This place has a very wide selection of all the standard hawker food. Quality of course varies between the stalls, but there are some definite gems to be found. Also some decent fruit juice available here. Worth a visit, but best to avoid the lunchtime crush between 12 and 2pm."
,,Clean and organized,4.0,,"This is the cleanest Hawker center I have been to so far. It has sinks to wash your hands, restrooms and staff is constantly cleaning tables.It's good to bring your own napkins. I couldn't find any. We had Oyster cakes and of course the chicken and rice. Both very good."
,,"Wow, what a selection.",5.0,,"We have visited Singapore many times as we have family living there. Tried The Maxwell Road Hawker Centre, by far the busiest and largest we have been to. Lots of tourists and lots of locals, big queues for the 'chicken rice' at the stall recommended by top chefs. However the chicken rice at other outlets are just as good without the wait. Tremendous selection of food at, all very cheap. Eat like a king for ¬£5."
,,One Of The Best Food Center,4.0,,"Great varieties of food, from chicken rice to fried hokkien prawn mee, Nasi Lemak and prata. Lots of choices, one of the best hawker center!"
,,Best authentic singaporean food,5.0,,"This is the food hall the locals eat at. Went to one of the stalls that just had one massive pot cooking the one dish they serve. Was the best curry I have ever tasted. Kids loved there meals as well, all for $3 to $5, superb!"
,,One of the BEST in Singapore,5.0,,"This hawker centre is one of the best in SG. Many stalls selling cheap and good food, much loved by locals and visitors alike.

Don't just eat Tian Tian Chicken Rice...

Shld also sample
1) Zhen Zhen's Porridge and Raw Fish,
2) China Street's Chinese Sausage, and
3) Lim Kee (Orchard)'s Banana Fritters.
They are the best in Singapore IMHO."
,,"Been to many hawkers centre, this is one of the best",4.0,,"What's makes this place stand out from the rest is that you get to queue for half an hour to get a delicious chicken rice or if you like something soup based, there is this famous fish noodle soup. I tried both of them and they were excellent. I hardly used the word excellent for hawkers food but these two didn't leave me thirsty so I'm thinking they didn't add any msg or flavour enhancer. The juices there only cost sgd2.5 which is affordable and comes in a big cup. Plenty of seats. Get to tanjong pagar mrt, exit from A, turn right and walk straight up, you won't miss this place."
,,Best food of Singapore,5.0,,Very inexpensive real singapore food with great variety.no pretensions just join a table and pass the time of day withe locals
,,Impressive gastronomical experience,5.0,,"Quite a surprise this doesn't make the top of the list, the crowd and the make up of the place may feel overwhelmed at first. But it boasts an enormous number of food choices, I had to pick by looking out for stalls with long lineups or newspaper coverage/food critic postings. According to guide book, the best place should have been Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice but the few nights I went there the stall was closed, so I went for the next best in Ah Tai and I will bet that it tasted just as good as Tian Tian. You can easily fill yourself up for SGD5-7 or less here so as long as you don't mind the shared seating and no ac it's definitely a must visit for tourists"
,,The CHEAPEST Meals you will EVER have!,4.0,,"The Maxwell Road Hawker Centre is situated close to Chinatown. It boasts an extensive variety of foods ranging from Malaysian, Chinese, Indian, Singaporean, and much much more. I recommend coming in with an open mind and an eagerness to try new things. There is just so much food to try! Meals are a steal - you can have breakfast, lunch, and dinner for probably just around $3-4 each!!! Sugar cane drinks are very common in Singapore and you can get one for about $1. They're highly refreshing and highly recommended!

For you less adventurous and more heat stroke-prone tourists, it should be noted that these are essentially open markets without air-conditioning. If you are not interested in eating in the boiling heat and being surrounded by flies, maybe you should be dining away at some overpriced restaurant."
,,I've dreamed about the food here,5.0,,"We discovered this gem on a previous visit, and were drooling at the chance to come back. Peanut pancakes, fresh fruit, and ""kopi"" for breakfast, duck with noodles for lunch, Hainan chicken for dinner ... or go for vegetarian or Halal or curry or ... you get the idea. The food doesn't disappoint, and the best part is that 2 people can eat and drink for less than S$15. Buy some tissue packets from one of the elderly locals for your napkins. I'm going to miss those pancakes."
,,got there late,3.0,,"We got there a bit late, and the majority of stalls were shut. But had standard, chicken and rice, plus some basics. If all were open it would have been excellent range if choices. Next time we will plan better, but looks like a good site for food."
,,Don't be afraid to 'dive in'.,5.0,,"Don't be daunted by this crowded, buzzing hawker centre. It was my first time here and being alone, at first I felt a little overawed by the crowds and food choices, however I took a deep breath and joined the throng.

My meal of choice was dark carrot cake, which is not carrot cake as we westerners know it. To accompany it I chose a watermelon juice which is always my drink of choice whenever possible.

After being served I then had to find myself a seat. Looking around I spotted a spare stool and asked the three young people at the table if it was free. They smiled and motioned for me to sit down. It turned out they (two young men and a young woman) were on their lunch break and we had a wonderful conversation about our different cultures and they gave me a lot of information on what it was like for them to live in Singapore.

My food was delicious and cheap and I had the added benefit of delightful company."
,,"Great food, great atmosphere and cheap",5.0,,"If you're into Asian food, then the Maxwell Road Hawker Centre is a treat - one of many in Singapore.

Forget your fancy restaurants that charge a fortune for their take on satay and where you get no change from a $20 for a beer - go here instead.

LOADS of stalls and different kinds of food to choose from, reasonably priced beer and character.

Grab a seat at a table with a heap of strangers, set down your dish and enjoy. Alternatively, wander from stall to stall (as we did) sampling the wares at each for a reasonable price.

Treat yourself here one day and the Tekka Centre in Little India the next :-)"
,,HAWKER AT ITS BEST,4.0,,"The Maxwell Food Centre takes on all comers - taxi drivers, students, office workers, and tourists. It‚Äôs my favorite hawker centre, but with so many hawker centres in Singapore, If I had to recommend just one, however, it would be Maxwell Road Food Centre,.
On the edge of Chinatown, Maxwell is perhaps the most famous of Singapore‚Äôs iconic eating centres Located between the imposing URA Centre and the magnificent Buddha Tooth Relic Temple in the Tanjong Pagar area of Chinatown, Walking around it is a sensory adventure. The din of happy eaters combines with the clanging of hot woks over roaring flames, the chopping sound of razor-sharp cleavers on hundred-year-old cutting blocks and the sizzle of good food cooking. It‚Äôs a dizzying kaleidoscope of smoke, steam, smells and sounds.Of its numerous stalls, certain ones draw bigger crowds. Top of the list is Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice internationally known. There‚Äôs inevitably a long queue, but don‚Äôt walk away; just jump in and watch the action behind the counter. Your plate of chicken rice is an old-school version: juicy, slightly pink flesh with a delicate flavour, slick skin and succulent, beige-coloured rice. Eat it with the gentle sting of chilli-garlic-ginger sauce and a drizzle of thick soy syrup, and you‚Äôll understand why this dish ‚Äì above all others is what Singaporeans overseas dream of when they‚Äôre homesick.
Maxwell‚Äôs food centre has over 100 stalls, they offer so much choice that the only way to decide your personal favorites is to go there again and again, each time trying something different. And why not? It‚Äôs central to everything and easy to get to. The closest MRT station is Chinatown (NE4) Maxwell Road Food Centre is two short blocks away on the left, opposite the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple."
,,Ok for street food,3.0,,"I was a bit disappointed as I was expecting some buzzing atmosphere with plenty people, but it felt a bit deserted and the food was only ok.. Maybe I didn't go at the right time."
,,"Good hawker centre, nice location and bring your own serviettes/napkins",4.0,,Enjoyed coming here several times during our stay in Singapore. Lots of variety to choose from for very little money. Follow the lines. If you see a queue just get in it. It will probably be good. The hawker centres and most restaurants do not offer serviettes/napkins. Odd but true. They will either sell them to you or people come around and sell packs of tissues. We stayed right across the street at the Scarlet Hotel which is a great location. China town food street is just a 5 minute walk from here. This is not air-conditioned but is covered nicely. Cheers and happy eats!
,,Wide selection of inexpensive street food,4.0,,"Quite a variety of options: Singaporean, Thai, vegetarian, Indian, Muslim halal dishes, Chinese, Malay, etc. It gets quite busy at meal times because locals come here. Tourists are the minority. Food is tasty and inexpensive. Experience Singapore like a local: eat at one of the many hawker locations throughout Singapore. I tried Maxwell Road only once. I barely scratched the surface.
I had the Chicken Rice Set. The steamed chicken was delicate, the rice was perfectly cooked, and the bok choi was still slightly crunchy. Perfect.
Be forewarned that this is outdoors, so no air conditioning. Also, you need to stand in line for your food. Seating is limited during busy times. If you wonder why the line moves slowly, it's because people ahead of you are buying take-out presumably for several office mates."
,,Best 'taste Asian' food in Singapore,5.0,,"This place is a Singapore institution among the locals and a must visit for visitors. We stayed just across the road at the Scarlett Hotel and ate most of our meals at the Maxwell Food Centre during our 3 day stay.

Can't beat eating congee (savoury rice porridge) or murtabak for breakfast surrounded by Singapore locals, or a mix and match banquet with cold Tiger beer at day's end. Food and beer is probably the cheapest in Singapore and government certification ensures strict hygiene."
,,good chicken rice,5.0,,"the best chicken rice ever at Tian Tian. I am lucky to get there early, so i don't have to wait in line too long. the food is cheap and excellent. this place has plenty of food selection and very easy to find."
,,Good quality Asian style food at a valuable price!,4.0,,"This is a self service food hall at Singapore near Chinatown. From there, you can find around 100 food stalls. Most of their food is in good quality and at a valuable price. As my own opinion, its food is better than FoodRepublic food hall which you can find at most of the shopping centre. If you don't mind there is no air conditioning, you must go their to have your lunch. (Don't go there too late because during dusk, the food or dishes from the favorite and famous stall will be sold out and the stall will be closed accordingly.

We recommended the travellers must try ""Tian Tian Chicken Rice"" and ""Jin Hua Fish Head Bee Hoon"". GREAT!!!"
,,Cheap & good local street food,4.0,,"An excellent collection of local Singapore food patronized by the locals. The iconic Hainanese Chicken Rice, there are at least 4 stalls here, all good. Congee, Fish soup, Soup and Fried Noodles, Satay, Rojak, Steamed Buns, Duck Rice, Fried Rice Noodles, Fishball Soup, Fried Rice, Fresh Fruits, Cold & Hot Desserts, and more.
Non air-conditioned, but sufficient ceiling fans provide adequate ventilation, except perhaps on the hottest of days. Generally clean, although, there are times when the cleaning-up tend to be rather slow, resulting in tables being piled with used plates etc.
Recommended for all, looking to taste what locals usually eat."
,,Great value,4.0,,"A very pleasant experience and possibly the cheapest beer in Singapore! Food is good, cheap and the stallholders aren't pushy at all. Would choose this over Lau Pa Sat any day."
,,"90 street vendors to choose from (yes, I counted!)",4.0,,"Aftrr eating at the just as big Chinatown complex the night before we (as Westerners) felt completely weird. That place was so traditional it was just too much. The food and stench overehelming.

Thr Maxwell centre was perfect. No stench. Clean kitchens, slightly more staple in menu without going mainstream. Cheap and cultural. A total winner. Highly recommended for those seeking a ""real"" experience. Average $4 a meal vs. $28 for restaurant"
,,A must visit singapore institution,4.0,,"The hawker centres in Singapore are fantastic, incredible value, all really clean, with a star rating to ensure standards are maintained. You need to be a little bit brave, but it's worth it."
,,Wonderful Selection!,5.0,,"This was one of my favorite parts of the trip. I absolutely love street food, and this had the widest selection I've seen.

As a vegetarian, I was unable to try Singapore's national Chicken and Rice dish, but this place had a ton of vegetarian options! I went to a stall that was completely vegetarian, and had roasted and stir fried vegetables, tofu, and rice. Totally delicious. There were also some sweet potato dessert cakes I sampled, and those were killer.

Some other stalls looked very promising, but I was too full to continue sampling! Fruit juices and more dessert cakes and tons of chicken and seafood! Options for everyone, vegetarians included. Definitely make it a stop on your trip!"
,,Little disappointed,3.0,,"Having been told this was the place to eat in Chinatown we headed over in expectation but were left a little disappointed, Half of the stalls seemed to be closed including the famous tian tian chicken rice stall (for the duration of our stay). The food we had was good but not spectacular. Found better food in the Chinatown complex."
,,Affordable food in Singapore,5.0,,Excellent affordable food option in Singapore with food stall vendors selling quite a variety of Asian foods. It was great to find some where to eat without 'breaking the bank' and enjoy a cold beer.
,,Eat like the locals,4.0,,We were told that a Hawker place is where most locals and tourists eat. We found this one en route to our city tour (Chinatown).

We were advised that stall no 10 had one of the best loved dishes, Tian Tian Chicken Rice. The queue was around 30 customers deep, which suggested to us, this stall was special. It took around half an hour to get served. Yes, the chicken was succulent, rice was tasty and the meal extremely cheap (S$3.50). On our second visit, we got the same dish from stall No 44, no queue and every bit as tasty for a few cents more. Finding a table can be a challenge around standard meal times but worth persevering."
,,"Loads of choice, though very busy!!",4.0,,"Had lunch at the Maxwell Road food centre one day. Wasn't really that hungry but couldn't resist when I saw the food on offer! My friend had informed me that the chicken rice was good as well as a soya bean curd stall and an ondeh ondeh stall. Sadly the ondeh ondeh stall wasn't open when we visited. Am not a big fan of chicken rice so decided to give that a miss. Bought some mixed dumplings from a stall (can't remember the name!) near a porridge stall - all well cooked and delicious. Also had pork and century egg congee from the porridge stall - absolutely delicious with a generous portion of century egg. Tried some rojak which wasn't bad. If I had more time in Singapore, would have liked to have gone back to try other stalls. Will make a point to visit again the next time I am in town. Pet peeve - annoying people 'reserving' seats with packets of tissue!! Are they kidding?!"
,,One of the best Hawker Centers in singapore,4.0,,"Singapore local food at its best. Not easy to find a table , but large variety of top notch food stalls. Be patient..you ll be rewarded. Peak hours on Sunday, 30mn line to get the famous Chicken Rice from Tian Tian, 45 mn for the extraordinary porridge from Zhen Zhen..( A velvety porridge from another dimension ..) and many others to choose from ! ( just follow the lines and be polite and patient or they will kick you out like the Soup Nazi in Seinfeld ..) dirt cheap as well.."
,,Yummy Choices,4.0,,"The area is clean despite the large number of people dining. If you want to save while tasting the different Singaporean food, this is the place to go. I just hope that people eating there will keep the area and their table clean after eating."
,,Nicr food range,4.0,,Food selection is awesome. They environment is good amd also very accessible. We eat here everyday for lunch
,,Varieties of delicious food,4.0,,"After visiting Chinatown this food center is a stone throw away. Here there are various hawker foods at local price very reasonable for tourists. Many must try foods like the famous Tian Tian chicken rice, zhen zhen Fish porridge or Nasi brani. Many other varieties of noodles cook in different styles. Just renovated recently it crowded during lunch and dinner times. It near to the white collar offices.So weekdays it is especially packed during lunch times."
,,An Excellent Experience - But not sure Chicken 'n' Rice is for me!,4.0,,"This is one of those 'cultural' food experiences that you simply just have to dive in and try while in Singapore as Food Courts are favourites with locals and this makes for a memorable tourist experience.

The ""Maxwell Food Court"" (or Hawker Centre as it's also known as) is located at the corner of South Bridge Road and Maxwell Road just across from the 'Buddha Tooth Relic Temple' (which is well worth a visit in itself), in the Chinatown district of Singapore. It is like an aircraft hanger that is packed full of little individual food stalls and communal tables and chairs. You select your food and can then go and sit anywhere you like to eat it. There are fans but no air-con so be prepared to get wet and sticky!

I was told that 'the traditional dish' for Singapore was the famous 'Chicken & Rice', a fragrant steamed chicken with a watery broth served with steamed rice and a dipping sauce. The chicken is stone cold however, (yep that's how it's meant to be), and I just found the dish rather unappetising. However it is cheap food, (just SG$5.00), and I was going for the cultural experience anyway rather than a hearty feast knocked out by a 5-Star Chef.

The best place as advised by a local, (and it was certainly the busiest by far with a queue of locals at it even past lunchtime rush hour at gone 2pm), is stall number 10 and 11 - Called ""Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice"". I have included photographs to help you locate it but it has a distinctive blue and white frontage... I have also included pictures of the chicken which may, like me, dampen your appetite! (Tee Hee). *Note: I am a BIG lover of all Asian food and lived for 2 years in Hong Kong, so please don't think I am some lame tourist not liking the local nosh as I have eaten all sorts in Vietnam, Cambodia, mainland China, Korea, Japan and Taiwan... But this particular famous Singapore dish just didn't float my boat I'm afraid. Maybe it was because it was cold and I was just having an off day or maybe seeing the chickens in the display put me off?

Anyway I hope my review helped... DO give it a try as when in Rome do as the Romans - Enjoy!!"
,,Maxwell Rd Hawker Centre,5.0,,"Great place to eat. Good food with a great variety, Have the fish soup, porridge, Oyster cake, popiah, etc. Lots of option at a great price."
,,So many good food and it's cheap!!,5.0,,"This is a place I grow up with and I have been coming here to dine with my parents and friends for so many years in my life. I have never got tired or bored with the food here. So many good food to choose from and they are all in a reasonable price range.

A MUST GO & TRY food place if you visit Singapore."
,,A congregation of good local hawker fare!,3.0,,"Maxwell market is well known to locals for its cheap & good food. And so they say, go where the locals go to have a real taste!

The tian tian chicken rice stall has made a name for itself that you can expect a long queue packed with locals & tourists on every single day it is open. The chicken rice is fragrant & chicken is tender & juicy.add lots of chilli, garlic sauce dark sauce - I can say 1 plate seems never enough!

Zhen zhen porridge is another stall you see snaking long queues. It's the Cantonese style gooey kind of porridge done to the right texture. With the freshest ingredients & cooked on the spot, it's no wonder many locals actually don't mind queueing 45 min to 1 hr!

And then, there's this stall which sells oyster cake at S$2 each. The little round fried cake may look unappealing with its dark skin.. but oh my, I bought for my foodie friends & everyone raved about how yummy it is! Well worth my money spent to see everyone happily enjoying it! Best to eat it when still warm!

And of cos, there's the peanut soup stall & the lao ban dou hua stall if you want desserts.

Many stalls have earned certificates of endorsements or photos of visits by even prominent figures, which they proudly display at their stall front. Go for those stalls.

& of course, if there is a snaking queue, you know where's the popular food!

But wear light and if possible, bring a portable hand held fan, as it can really quite hot!"
,,Great food great value in a central location,4.0,,"One of my favourite hawker centres in Singapore. The standout for this hawker centre besides its food is its cleanliness compared to other famous ones eg Hong Lim Food Centre, Old Airport, etc.

Love:
1. Zhen Zhen Porridge (if you don't mind the long queue which does not move too slowly). I love that they are so generous with their ingredients from the fish slices to its condiments like chillies, chives and ginger slices unlike other porridge stalls. It is like they understand you need to add however much you want to bring up the porridge to your personal taste level. And they do not charge higher than what any other porridge stall charge for these extras.

2. Tian Tian Chicken Rice - the tender juicy chicken and its accompanying flavourful rice is what makes the crowd come back for more as confirmed by its long queue which moves pretty fast.

3. Jin Hua Sliced Fish Beehoon Soup - Its rich tasty stock with generous their portion of fish slices has a perennial slow moving line in front of its stall. Why? Because each bowl is cooked to order and you just have to wait for them to cook yours when it is your turn.

4. Xing Xing Tapioca Cake - A wonderful way to wrap up a great meal in Maxwell Hawker Centre with their soft and and not too chewy Tapioca Steamed Kueh, Kueh Kosui, Baked Ubi Kayu Kueh, Ondeh Ondeh and my favourite their Mochi which has peanut or coconut centres. They use quality gula melaka for their coconut and ondeh ondeh and the taste shows. The fact their kueh sell out by around noon each day tells you how good they are.

5. Ah Baling Peanut Soup Stall - I do not remember the name of this stall but the peanut soup is a delicious balance to the chewy mochi balls which has various fillings of peanut, black sesame, yam or red bean filling. Besides Ah Baling Peanut Soup, they also have taosuan and redbean soup.

The above are my 5 favourites but there are many great stalls too. They also have Italian and Japanese foodstalls. When you have so many great stalls as your neighbours, it inevitably raises the culinary standards for the rest of the stalls as well in order for them to survive in such a competitive environment. This can only be wonderful for food hunters coming to this famous food centre in Singapore, where tourists from all over the world come to check what all the fuss is about."
,,Good Local Favourates,4.0,,"Good venue for hawker food with plenty of choice from all time favourite chicken rice to char kway tiow and the simple but original Ngo Hiong Kuan Qiang.
The ngo hiong stall does not come with too many variety of items to choose from like many other stalls out there. This could be their unique selling point to go simple and original. Along with the fried bee hoon with bean sprout in dark soya sauce.
you not miss to see the queue for the deep fried sweet potato ball which is ideal for a light snack or after meal bite.
I would recommend this place to traveller visiting Singapore."
,,Spoilt for choices,4.0,,"There are many stall owners who run the business for decades. Only 20% new comers are foreigners to add variety to the otherwise very authentic Singapore lo an cuisines.

Some recommendations such as the Chinese soups, fish slice bee hoon, fried fritters (round ones), tapioca cakes and the huge porridge stall at a corner.

However the place is not air conditioned, if you are afraid of the heat, wear something light.

Bon appetit"
,,go for best local food,4.0,,"I love to bring my friends or visitors to this lovely market with amazing choice of local food. best chicken rice as all know, deep fried sweet potato, fresh fruits and juices"
,,Good variety hawker food and reasonable prices,4.0,,"If you live in Singapore long enough, you will know that food is quite a major part of people's lives. And where there's a long queue, the food is bound to be good (well, accurate most of the time). Try the famous sliced fish soup and congee in the middle aisles, Tian Tian chicken rice, ah balling (sesame/peanut filling glutinuous rice balls in a sweet soup as dessert), or goreng pisang (fried banana), just to name a few good stuff.

So, go on and queue if you are up for it; buy a few varieties, and share amongst yourselves. At Maxwell, you will find some of the best food requires patience and quick reflexes in ""choping"" (i.e. reserving) a table and seats especially if you are here during weekday lunch time (12-2+pm). Be prepared to develop an eagle's eye and dive in for the next available table with the office people! But if you are don't mind sharing one, don't be shy to ask. The local office crowd in Singapore is most famously known to reserve the free seating tables with items such as tissue paper, umbrellas and other not so valuable items. While this may not go down well with the not so local people or overly polite patrons, people have a general understanding that the presence of such belongings means the table is ""taken"". Hey, it works when you are battling some 1000 others who are on the same lunchtime crunch as you!!"
,,Eat like a local,4.0,,"With maybe a 100 stalls to choose from this is ""street food"" at its best. It is chaotic, noisy, but spotlessly clean. It won't be everybody's cup of tea and it is totally self-service but the choice is bewildering! Situated on the edge of ""china-town"" it is frequented by tourists and locals alike and well worth a visit."
,,Budget friendly food center,5.0,,Loved this place! We ate here for tian tian chicken! Tian chicken stall9 or 10! Best in the city and always a long line up! We had kopi at one of the stands..so good! My husband had their fresh juices and he says that it was one of the best he has tasted. We also ate breakfast here. We had the trAditional congee. It was really good! It's in the middle of the hawker center. Look for the one with always a long line up! Zhen zhen perhaps?
,,Bit of a disappointment,3.0,,"Being Bourdain watchers we went to Maxwell Road to have the chicken he raved about. There were queues but I have no idea why, it was pretty ordinary. So I am really rating the centre on the Bourdain chicken but there was the added fact that I couldn't find a cold beer in any of the eateries."
,,"Typical hawker centre, but for tian tian",3.0,,"Some people will come here just for the tian tian chicken rice, and if you do, avoid the peak hours of 1130am-2pm and 6-8pm. And of course, after 8pm they are likely sold out. There's another chicken rice stall next to the tian tian which is just as good, as it is opened by an ex employee with the same chicken contacts and experience

Other than that, it's quite a ho-hum place that is oldish and hot, despite several renovations over the years"
,,"A ""must try"" in Singapore",5.0,,"Well worth experiencing the wonderful Chicken Rice in this buzzing food court. Look for the queues with the most locals and buy from there! Enjoy some amazing fruit drinks too...not quite sure what we had but it was good! A tasty meal and great fun for only a few quid. Why would you go to Starbucks, Subway and all the other western style fast food places when you can enjoy this tasty chicken and mix with the locals. Go on, try it!"
,,wide selection of Singapore eats on a budget,4.0,,"Went here for breakfast (congee, steamed bun and coffee) and lunch (hainanese chicken rice - the long queue was worth it!)."
,,Great food great prices,5.0,,"Make the effort to go, the experience is great sit on shared tables with the crowds and enjoy great freshly cooked good quality food. The variety is fantastic beer is cold and you will have a great time"
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"Happened to try chicken rice here when our group went to nearby temple. The place turned out to be crowded especially you have to queue (long queue). Eventually we got our chicken rice. Portions are generous, price is reasonable and very tasty. I have tried many chicken rice places around Singapore but this so far top of the list."
,,The Fast n the Furious Chicken Rice,4.0,,"Purposely visited the Maxwell Road Hawker Centre for the legendary Tian Tian Chicken Rice. But, after a morning in the heat exploring Chinatown in the heat and two tired kids, I didn't bother waiting in the queue (which was 30 people long/20 minutes at noon and growing). We did get our chicken rice from another vendor and wasn't disappointed. Fruit juice stalls were lovely and the lime drink was so refreshing. Would go back in the night as the atmosphere in the night would be better than the day."
,,Good food at low price,4.0,,"We went here twice during our last trip to Singapore as my parents in law really likes the tian tian Hainan chicken rice, and I like the price! Be aware that the cue could be very long, but it is worth it."
,,A must try...,5.0,,"On the edge of Chinatown and close to two interesting attractions (SG City Gallery and Buddha Tooth Relic Museum) this is one of the best hawker centres in SG, so take yr time to take yr pic ... I shall definitely be back for more of the oyster cake..... For those not accustomed to SG please disregard the (facetious) reviews which describe the ""cons"" as being ""long lines"" and ""no napkins"". As those who have bothered to read the basic travel info, you will know that no hawker centre provides ""napkins"" for free .... You bring your packet of tissues to the table and save your spot... It is known as a ""chop"". As a matter of habit, when you see a long line, join it ... It means the food is worth the wait! As with all food cts & hawker centres try and get there before 12 noon (lunch) and 6 pm (supper) to avoid the crowds... We eat early in SG!"
,,Excellent we,5.0,,"We were blown away when we came here, so much choice we had to come back a second time. The hianese chicken we had was lovely, as was the chicken feet and dim sum bits we tried. I also recommend trying the sugar cane water with lime- it's delicious. Very clean and everyone very friendly and helpful."
,,"Crowded, hot, noisy and loving every minute of it.",5.0,,"This was a bucket list item for me. Seen it on many travelogue shows on TV and always wanted to go experience the street food side of Singapore for myself. I was worried that perhaps I was over hyped on it and would be let down by the reality. Short answer - NO.
We even queued for the real deal Chicken Rice - took nearly 35 minutes to get to the ordering window and that was mid week and off-peak, but it was worth it. All the stall offer some taste of Asia and are hugely patronised by Singaporeans and travellers alike. Tables are always full - no personal space here, but that's part of the reality. It is day to day life for may patrons here. The only downside was on one visit we ordered a pineapple juice fron a stall that showed a drink with fresh fruit etc - it was cordial with ice and 4 pieces of canned pineapple chunks in it. Sugary and not what was shown. Check first that drinks are the real deal if you cant see them making them. Several were selling real juices too - we just made the wrong choice but only once!!
I would have loved to sample food from every stall. Highly recommend this Chinatown Icon.
Accessibility - It was a 35 minute walk back to our next stop at Raffles and when in Singapore you need to walk off a few calories :)"
,,Go here for chicken and rice,4.0,,Tin Tin sells out quickly and has the longest lines. We went at 11:30 to beat the lunch rush. Delicious! Bring your own napkins. Best meal ever for 3.50
,,Nice variety of food,5.0,,Nice variety of food plus the place is not so hot even its not crowded plus its very accesible if you either take train or bus
,,Fairly dated,3.0,,This hawker centre has quite a dated feel. A nice place to feel like a local but the food wasn't great and we found much nicer hawker places a short walk away.
,,great food!,5.0,,"Great place to enjoy local food and the best Chicken on Rice in the city! Place is clean, can find seat easily and vendors are not very friendly but they all speak English. If you are for few days in Sing then you must experience Maxel Food Court close to Chinatown"
,,singapoe's most ballyhooed hawker center,4.0,,"a lot is written about this hawker center as its one of the most convenient for tourists. however, although its just a typical hawker center as can be found all over singapore that also means its no slight and thankfully its as authentic as any other. i really have to salute the management on the variety of the food stalls, its excellent. for lunch i had a pickled whole fish to pick at along with some baby octopus and a bowl of soothing plain rice congee porridge and my spouse had a haianese curry chicken platter. that along with a tiger beer really hit the spot after marching around touristing in chinatown and elsewhere that day. afterward be sure take a left out of the building and take a walk through upscale tanjong pagar neighborhood nearby as its quite a nice winding down contrast to hectic chinatown."
,,Chicken Rice,5.0,,"We were recommended to try Chicken Rice at Tian Tian Hainanese at Maxwell Food Court. Very busy food court but the line at Tian Tian was out the door, but still very quick. S$15 for 1/2 steamed chicken and vegies with oyster sauce and 2 steamed rice. Absolute bargain and melt in the mouth. Do not miss it."
,,Good cheap food!,5.0,,"This hawker center had everything we wanted. We had the Hainanese chicken, some great juice, and overall just had a fun Singaporean meal."
,,Great hawker center and very clean,4.0,,"Good variety of places to choose from in this center. Opens by 10am or 11am depending on the day, and can get busy in key meal times. Reserving place to sit before you go to the stalls to order is helpful to ensure a place for eating. You can order to eat there or for small price more can take-away and eat in park area.

Great to try a small bit from different stalls if you are with a few people. Ratings by each stall gives indication between A, B or C for quality rating. A and B are quite good, never have seen a C rating as cleanliness fairly good.

Don't dawdle, there are plenty who want to sit and eat after you."
,,Great local food,4.0,,"Went to maxwell food place after friends recommendation. Lots of choice and you kinda get lost in it so I went for a simple strategy: just saw where people were going the most and went there. It was a stall called ah tai and apparently it has a curious story behind as chef was fired from a stall which was just 2 stalls after and now Is very successful. I had a chicken set menu which was absolutely delicious and was only 5sgd with a soup, pak choi and a bowl of rice. Also if you there I highly recommend to try fresh pressed juices from any exotic combinations you can imagine. My favourite was guava with a sour plum!!!"
,,"Authentic, Delicious and Cheap",5.0,,"For an authentic Singapore experience eat at one of the hawker centers. The Maxwell Hawker Center was excellent even though we went around 10AM. The great thing about these centers is that you get to buy lots of different foods. For our visit, we ordered freshly squeezed dragon fruit and soursop juices, Singaporean carrot cake, and prawn noodles. Everything was delicious and each dish cost us under $8. There's no air conditioning so in the hot Singaporean summers, it's a bit hot and sticky."
,,real food!,5.0,,"After asking around it was clear that if we wanted a sample of genuine Singaporean food we should head to Maxwell Road hawkers market and it didn't disappoint, we arrived at lunch and it was very busy, always a good sign in my opinion, all table were occupied but easy to share with others. the 40+ units selling food offered a vast array of dishes both local and further afield with many taking the time to explain what was on offer. A must visit if you don't want to just eat in resturants."
,,"Hainanese chicken, carrot cake and lime Juice",5.0,,"Tian-Tian (you have to trust Tetsuya Wakuda AND Anthony Bourdain don't you?) for perfect Hainanese chicken rice and pretty much any stall for the MOST delicious black carrot cake (turnip pancakes with sweet soy) Add a refreshing, fresh, sweet lime juice and marvel at how little money you've just spent. Food heaven. I still dream about this place..."
,,Many people,4.0,,"Be sure if you eat here, try to be early and beat the lunch hour traffic. As this food court serves for working class and tourists, you will expect a big crowd.

Don't be shy to ask if you can share a table with strangers, it's quite normal in Singapore.

Food are priced at a relatively reasonable range. Try chicken rice, fried radish, fish head/slice noodles, ondeh ondeh.

Reasonably clean. down side: At times too many people making it too packed."
,,Cheap and tasteful dinner!,5.0,,"Since Singapore isn't the cheapest city to visit, the Hawker food court was the best place to have a cheap, affordable and at the same time really tasteful dinner. We had fun deciding what we wanted to eat and enjoyed every bit of it. It's also a good place to meet local people. We ended up at a table with two people from Singapore and it was nice talking to them while enjoying our dinner"
,,Fantastic experience,5.0,,So much delicious food to pick from. Easy to find and terrific value for such an expensive city. Good location. Every taxi will know it. Enjoy.
,,The best place to eat,5.0,,"This place was the bomb, the best meals at very great price no more than 5 Singapore dollars. Nice, clean and each meal just as delicious as a restaurant meal. Avoid going to a restaurant in Singapore. At a restaurant your paying up to 45 Singapore dollars for a meal."
,,Some good food if you are selective,4.0,,"Wide choice and variety of food available if you are selective, among the best is Zhen Zhen rice porridge stall no 01-54 their rice porridge is well made, tasty and the elderly operators are generous with their condiments, you can easily find this stall, just look for the long queue, expect to wait up to 45 minutes but worth the wait, the Char Siew Pao at Hokeepau stall number 01-79-80 is also excellent, the vendors use fresh ingredients and no preservatives, hard to find Pau this good these days, the Hainan Chicken Rice at Ah Tai stall no.01-7 is also good, better than stall next door in our opinion, the Indian Curry stall and some others are better early in the day, go too late and it's been simmering all day and not the best.
Best tip here is walk around and look for the busiest stalls, prices are very cheap here too."
,,Cheap food for hangover...,5.0,,"Friday morning, woke up at Marina Bay Sand, handover and starving; Don't want to get ripped off from hotel breakki, went on Google map and found this place. Nek Minute, $7 taxi brought us there, What?! $40c for a coffee, $3 for a hainanese chicken rice, $3 for prawn noodles, $1 for a juice?! We ordered like a high roller, poured the food to the stomach like a homeless, and rubbed the tummy strolled back to the infinite pool like the winners.."
,,Very good place to sample local Singapore cuisine,4.0,,"Although it's hard to find a place to sit during lunch hours and there is no air-conditioning, this is an excellent place to check out all the variety of tasty local Singapore food offerings. There's also a coffee place for a nice iced latte or similar beverage, a nice touch for those of us caffeine addicted travelers. It was very close to my hotel, and I enjoyed eating at this hawker centre. I think if you never eat at a hawker centre, you haven't experienced Singapore properly, at least regarding its cuisine offerings, and Maxwell Road is a good place to enjoy this experience."
,,Great value hawker food in Singapore Chinatown,4.0,,"Delicious traditional hawker food at very reasonable prices. Choose authentic specialties from the many stalls. Each one specialises in a few tasty dishes, cooked fresh to your liking. It is hot (it's Singapore after all) and you have to line up but it's SO worth it."
,,Authentic Singapore,5.0,,"No trip to Singapore is complete without stopping here for chicken rice and other hawker specialties. Good atmosphere and cheap prices -- so if you don't like something, just order something else. Authentic lunch or dinner for less than $10."
,,Great memories + yummmy + cheap,4.0,,"Love the fried oyster biscuit on 2nd lane, porridge also my comfort food there. Great memories on sharing there. Air a little stuffy"
,,"Great value, authentic flavours.",4.0,,"Good food in Singapore doesn't have to be expensive and here we easily had our best dishes of all Hawker Centres. There is a fantastic variety of Asian cuisines from Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese to Singaporean which made it difficult to choose. We settled on a Thai place that cooked the dish in front of us on steaming hot woks, charges a very reasonable price and that tasted delicious.

Anyone who is doing Singapore on a budget must visit here more than once and try a different stall each time."
,,Chinatown Hawker Centre,4.0,,"After you have taken in the sights of Chinatown drop in for lunch at the Maxwell Food Centre. It is all good, busy with locals, and mighty good value. When you are looking for a change from the Hainanese Chicken Rice, try stall #72 the no (English) name venue for $3/4 wonton noodle (dry noodles, wonton, kai lan, sliced BBQ pork and black pepper gravy). Or roast duck......the vendor is a real character. Enjoy with a lime juice (or cold beer)."
,,When in Rome...,5.0,,"We wanted to experience the ""hawker centre"" culture in Singapore and weren't disappointed. The food is gloriously cheap and oh so tasty! We tried the hainanese chicken rice from Tian Tian. The drumstick is the nicest part of the chicken. It's worth shelling out an extra dollar to get the drumstick. We also tried the signature chicken curry noodles from the Ipoh curry noodle stall. It was yummy. The hawker centre can feel a bit stuffy. The outdoor tables are slightly cooler than the indoor tables. Be prepared to share your table with a local. That is part of the culture here. We also noticed that none of the stalls supply serviettes or napkins. Be prepared and bring a packet of pocket tissues with you - do as the locals do! If you're not sure what to eat then join the queue of locals - if there is a queue it's probably a good bet."
,,Try Once,3.0,,"We thought we should try ""hawker food"".... having heard so much about it.
It's true. ..

It's cheap.
It's generous portions.
It's sometimes fresh.

However. ... you should know the cons as well. ...
It's hot
It's crowded.
It's long lines.
It's disjointed timing.
It's not the cleanest.
No napkins.

Try it at least once. Like me. ..that might be enough."
,,Cheap good food :),5.0,,"I had the classic Chicken rice at the Haivaneese stand, and it was simple and delicious :) and cost only 5 sgd :) a little crowded, but people generally share the tables, so don't be afraid to ask for a seat."
,,Overall a good place for locals and tourists.,4.0,,Good food such as Tian Tian Hainanese chicken rice and fried banana fritters. But seating will be packed during peak hr.
,,"Great variety, fun atmosphere",4.0,,"So many different stalls to eat from, so cheap and an excellent atmosphere. Really clean too. A great place to try chicken rice."
,,Everything you can dream of,5.0,,"Favourite stalls:
- Lim Kee (Orchard) Banana Fritters (for the banana fritters)
- Maxwell Fuzhou Oyster Cake (OUT. OF. THIS. WORLD.)
- China Town Popiah (under Rojak - Popiah & Cockle) (even took some of these to the airport with us)
- Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice (you'll recognise this by it's massive queue)

Can't remember where I got my char kueh teow (fried kway teow) from but that, laksa and fried carrot cake (nothing to do with sweet dessert- but actually a steamed daikon/white Japanese radish cake) are also must haves here."
,,Great value and standard,4.0,,"We went here for breakfast and lunch a few times and sat amongst the local families... Great selection from a huge range of stalls. If your not sure just get in line at one of the busiest stalls and you know it will be fresh and taste great.
Cheapest beer prices inSingapore at the drinks stalls.
Do not visit Singapore without at least one visit to this place ... Just bring coins and a few low value notes as it is 'as cheap as chips!'"
,,Great local food and fantastic price,5.0,,"This place was recommended to us after doing a cooking class in Singapore. We had the chicken rice from Tian Tian Hainanese and also the black and white carrot cake from a stall located in the other isle. Whilst many rave about the chicken rice, my husband and I really loved the carrot cake (not cake in the form of dessert but a stir fry that does not contain carrots). I recommend trying both, the black is sweeter and the white salty but I really enjoyed both. For four dishes they cost us $12.50 and there was way too much food. Beers are also cheaper here with a large tiger costing only $6.50."
,,yum,5.0,,"price and quality of the food is amazing, get in early so you don't miss out on the popular stalls they sell out quick"
,,Great food and experience,5.0,,"This is a greet place to visit. Heaps of choice - local food which is soooo cheap. Fresh, tasty and a must do when in Singapore. Enjoy"
,,"Loved it - great cultural experience, cheapest meals",5.0,,"It might not be the best food that you will have in Singapore. But it would be the cheapest!
Great ambience, good variety, cheap, cheap, cheap.
Would recommend not coming here at lunchtime as it does get busy.
If you can't decide what to eat, just stand in the longest queue - can't go wrong!"
,,"Great price, lots of variety",4.0,,"Lots of variety of all a melting out of flavours and cuisines from around Asia. Enjoyed the hustle and bustle as we sampled different dishes which were really well priced, just save a seat with a tissue packet! As others have suggested arrive early into lunch or dinner for most choice."
,,Must go earlier for more options,3.0,,"When I was in Singapore a year ago, I really enjoyed the Hainan chicken at Maxwell centre, but it was quite a long queue I had to take.

Due to work, I only arrived at the centre after 9, there was unfortunately only a few stand left. They were okay and I had my dinner, but I may not go to Maxwell late in future so that one can enjoy the full range of food on offer."
,,I like fish noodle and the view!,4.0,,"Most of visitors or even Singaporean always come here for the famous chicken rice but I'm not. For me, fish noodle bowl tastes even better, not fishy at all. It's one of my fish soup. It's cheap and you don't need to wait in a long line. All you need to do is just come a bit earlier than the lunch time(around 11 am.) then no queue, pay and grab a seat in front of a temple. Enjoy your bowl and a view!!"
,,"Local ""same same but different"" food at a good price",3.0,,"With more stalls open at lunchtime, this is probably the best time to visit for wider variety. Chicken rice seems to be the most popular dish, with locals forming long queues to purchase their meals.

There is not much choice for vegetarians, but some stalls have side dishes such as stir fried vegatables, tofu, rice and noodles that can be purchased.

Bring your own packet of tissues to use as a serviette. Be prepared to sweat as you spend time wandering around before choosing your meal and sitting down to eat.

Overall a satisfactory place to visit, more for the experience of mixing it with the locals."
,,There are better places,2.0,,"Run down, no air conditioning and very average food in squalid surroundings. Singapore and Chinatown itself has much better on offer."
,,Yummy hainanese chicken,5.0,,Go to tian tian stall the place is very daggy looking and the wait at the stall is long but very we'll worth it the food was absolutely delicious.
,,Not at all what I expected!,3.0,,"We read many reviews here about the Maxwell Food Centre so thought we would give it a go. We expected crowds, persistent hawkers and lots of variety of foods. We got none of that! We went about 7 on a Saturday evening which we thought would be a fairly busy time. Not so. About half (if not more) of the stalls were closed and a few more closed while we were eating. No hawkers approached us at all to entice us to their stall. We found a table reasonably easily, it was busy but not packed. We chose a stall selling chicken and rice and it was nice but not great. Cheap though, each meal was only $4SD. It seemed reasonably clean, so is a good option for the budget conscious, but I don't think I'd bother going back. Too many other beautiful places to eat in Singapore!"
,,Eat where the locals Eat,4.0,,"Wonderful food, wonderful people watching. Good quality Excellent value for money Would love to see recycling bins in place"
,,Fabulous local food,5.0,,"The taxi driver told us we were staying near the best food in Singapore so after checking in , we went over for lunch. Steamed pork buns, fresh fruit juices, chicken rice and veges. All freshly cooked and delicious. There were 4 rows of food stalls. We went for breakfast, 2 fresh o/J and a plate of fresh fruit cost $6. Could have gone 3 times a day."
,,Little overrated but a must try,4.0,,Tried the Hianese chicken rice at Tian Tian and found it a bit overrated. Better ones at Albert centre at Bencoolen. But do look around for other cuisines and it's a must visit when in Singapore.
,,Decent local favourite,3.0,,Quite a lot nice food here.. What i like is chicken rice (Tian Tian Chicken Rice) always queue very long every lunch.. and banana fritters (Lim Kee Banana Fritters).. Place wise standard hawker centre hot and so so..
,,"Used to be better, but there are still hidden gems",3.0,,"Most tourists will make this a must-visit for Tian Tian chicken rice. Other good food you can try include:
- Hup Kee Wu Xiang Guan Chang
- Poh Piah & Rojak
- Xing Xing Ondeh Ondeh Tapioca Cake
- Maxwell Fuzhou Oyster Cake
- Teochew Fish Soup (middle row, corner nearer to URA Centre beside Scissors Curry Rice)
- Scissors Curry Rice
- Rickshaw Noodles (only stall (or just the remaining few) in SG still selling this)
- Ye Lai Xiang Western Food
- Fried Sweet Potato Dumplings
- Teochew Rice and Porridge (Stall 98)
- Jin Hua Fish Head Bee Hoon

Ok that's a lot of food, but hey - they are all really good! And, it will be a purple moon if all of them are open at the same time. Bon appetite ;)"
,,Ham Chee Peng,2.0,,"the ham chee pang is so cheap, average taste. but the oil is BLACK means they probably don't change it at all. the uncle was VERY VERY RUDE, keep rushing my friend and I and even scolded... WE WERE BUYING FOR THE 1ST time, how are we suppose to know how this is suppose to work???? there is no proper system and service is slow."
,,Cheap and tasty local food,4.0,,Almost every time I will Goto the Maxwell food court in China town. Especially the Tin Tin chicken rice is a must try dish. Always full of people line up at lunch and dinner time.
,,1st time at maxwell,3.0,,it was average for me.the haineanese chicken rice was a dissapointment.too much hype.there are many better chicken rice stalls elsewhere.the porridge stall was good though.with the fried pig intestines.4 stars i give
,,Cold beers and excellent food,5.0,,The drinks stall were sensational seating a large group of us together & provided cold Tigers. There is a huge choice of food to suit most people. Great atmosphere
,,Fantastic cheap clean & friendly,4.0,,"So glad we got out of the major tourist spots and found this place. Delicious food with a massive range of choices and cheap, even the beers. Would go back again. The place was really clean which was great."
,,"Authentic, good value food.",4.0,,Our first experience of a hawker centre and great fun. We had the benefit of a guide for our first time but we now feel comfortable about eating at hawker centres in the future. Look for your seats first and leave someone or something to reserve them and then find the stalls you want to eat from. Very good value food and a local experience. All stalls are hygiene rated with A being the best. We tried the chicken rice and I was particularly fond of the sweet carrot cake which is made from what they call a radish but is actually mooli. Cold drinks were good too. Avoid peak times if you can as it is very difficult to get a seat and some of the stalls have long queues.
,,Satisfying chicken soup,4.0,,"Full of atmosphere. Plenty of inexpensive choices. Every visitor to Singapore ought to try it at least once...though there are certainly other hawker centers that provide much the same experience. I finally tried the ""famous"" chicken rice at Stall #10 (Tian Tian) on a rare day when there was no line and found it good, but not exceptional. On the other hand, feeling the need for a pick-me-up, I tried both the Herbal Chicken Soup and the Black Chicken Soup at Stall #59 (Tai Seng Turtle Soup) and found them to be exceptionally delicious and rejuvenating. At $6/bowl, there was plenty of fresh, tasty chicken as well as hearty herbal broth. [Be aware that the herbal chicken soup is made with ginseng and other slightly bitter herbs and spices...somewhat of an acquired taste.] Don't be put off by the sign for turtle soup (which is more expensive, beginning at $11/bowl) but do try the healthy chicken soups."
,,"Affordable, but too crowrded",4.0,,Lots of selection there a stall famous for hainan chicken rice. It has a very long qeue. Near mrt. But a bit dirty.
,,"Fantastic food, fantastic atmosphere",5.0,,"What a great place. If you're looking for something more exciting this is the place to eat. Such a great range, even if we weren't sure what it was."
,,cheap good and fun,5.0,,"Great place to eat cheap. Good selection of everything. Juices, sodas, coconuts, curries, chinese, indonesian. All good stuff"
,,a taste of singapore,5.0,,"A good reflection on the variety and numbers of different nationalities that make up Singapore. So many choices, not to mention the prices, all in all our repeated trips to the Maxwell Food Court constituted some great food experiences. Great juice bars too. The one negative - Would have preferred not to see Turtle Soup for sale."
,,No frills good food,4.0,,"I used to work just behind the hawker centre and for all its convenience we used to cross the Street to Chinatown for lunch- Maxwell was the place for a quick take-away when we had meetings. Now that it is no longer in my backyard (or front yard in our case), I miss it. Great roast meat, great porridge, great Thai."
,,Cheap exciting food,5.0,,"This is really the most exciting place I have eaten. There are so many options you will never get through them all. It never cost more than $4 for a great feed, fresh fruit drinks are cheap and its just always busy and fun. Cant wait to go back"
,,Great scoff!!,5.0,,"We ate here on a couple of occasions in the evening and thoroughly enjoyed it. The atmosphere is brilliant and the variety of the food is immense. Top tip is to try and secure your table first and then go and order.

Great value and the people watching isn't bad either."
,,A Great Experience,4.0,,"Enjoyed the experience, all the food we tried at the various stalls was very good and lots of choice, cheap eats and lite bites. Even going for a beer and watching life. It has to be experienced."
,,Authentic Hawker Food,3.0,,"Decided on this food market, instead of Newton Circus, and found it partially closed over lunch time, but still enjoyed an interesting meal washed down with cheap Tigers. Possibly would not rush back again!"
,,"Cheap food, really bad service",1.0,,The place is fine if one wants cheap food and doesn't mind the quality or the surroundings. Service is horrible everywhere.
,,Good Value--Go Early,4.0,,"Lots of great choices, including chicken rice, carrot cake, dumplings, and barbecued beef. Hard to find a seat, but just sit down with other diners (mostly local, who will find it hilarious when you try to divide slippery noodles without a knife). By 8:30 pm, more stalls are closed than open, although you can still get a decent choice. Great value compared to same food in regular restaurants."
,,Taste of Singapore's famous dishes,4.0,,"This is one famous hawker place in Singapore. You can get tasty but cheap dishes here. There are a lot of stalls that offer Singapore's signature dishes like chicken rice, laksa, chicken porridge, different kinds of noodle dishes, etc. If you are concerned about the cleanliness of the food, your can refer to the cleanliness indicator that each stall has posted.

This place can be swarming with people especially on lunch and dinner, so don't mind if people share tables with you. Besides, you can even meet new friends while at it.

Try the famous bean curd sold here. It is the best!"
,,Chicken rice and porridge,5.0,,"I think I have been told by local friends that I have officially become a Singaporean after choosing to stand in line for a good one hour at Zhen Zhen Porridge. There is a big metal cauldron with an automatic stirrer that goes on and on so that the porridge is constantly kept in a well blended and smooth texture. Porridge options include sliced fish, fish belly, chicken, century egg. The porridge is the smoothest and creamiest I've had with hardly a trace of individual rice grains. The other star item is yusheng (raw fish salad), dressed with shaved lettuce, cilantro, ginger, sesame seed, sesame oil dressing, sliced fresh red chillies, and lime.

We return to Maxwell on another day at 2pm for hainanese chicken rice and there is a line of customers at Tian Tian despite the off peak hour. We decide to do a little ""chicken rice showdown"" among ourselves between Tian Tian and Ah Tai. Just before this, we hear that Ah Tai, another chicken rice stall that is located next to Tian Tian, is operated by a previous chef of Tian Tian. There was a fallout which led him to open the stall next door, and even going so far as to having a signboard with the same blue color theme. We order half a chicken from each Tian Tian and Ah Tai. Tian Tian's chicken is smooth and the skin retains the gelatinous layer which is very tempting to eat (admittedly, I decide to give in and sneak some chicken skin onto my spoon). It is what dreams are made of. The rice is fragrant and the glaze over the chicken has a good consistency. Ah Tai's chicken pieces look more pressed and flattened. The texture is not the smooth as the chicken from Tian Tian. The glaze and rice from Ah Tai also fall short.

The silky and milky broth at Jin Hua Sliced Fish Bee Hoon is what drives the line of people at this stall. The fish slices here are large with a solid texture. I do find it is misleading that despite the name of the stall having the word bee hoon in it, the noodles used look more like lai noodles (round, thick, and slippery noodles) rather than what I've come to know as bee hoon (thin rice noodles). The broth is silky and the added evaporated milk into the broth adds to the consistency. The flavor is evident but overall lacks an oomph factor."
,,Great one lifetime experience even for picky people,4.0,,"I was in Singapore for one week with my husband and while reading Tripadvisor restaurants reviews I found Maxwell. We went there on the day we visited the temples and Chinatown as it is really close by to these attractions. Wow, that was an experience!!! Many, many food choices from turtle soup (that I will never eat as I love turtles) till nice fresh all sprt of fruit juices on prices between 3 and 7 sing dollars, that is really cheap. You really feel you are in other parts of Asia and not anymore in the perfect organized Singapore. Everything we ate was really, really nice and fresh and the experience is unique. Tip: do not go there wearing heels or chic clothing ;)"
,,Great place for travellers and locals,5.0,,"When you are over fine dining every night and want quick, cheap, authentic Asian cuisine, this centre is the go. It is open air under a large roof of individual stalls selling a variety of Asian cuisines.
I sampled some of the best ever fresh mango for 50c AUD along with guava juice and chicken with bok choy chosen by the place with the most customers."
,,TANGLIN Curry Puff,5.0,,This is a must try when you are at Maxwell Road Hawker Centre... It's the best curry puff with nice curry filling....a must try
,,An amazing place for authentic Singapore food,4.0,,"The hawk offer a wide ranges of options on localised Chinese cuisine. The food was nothing but delicious. And the price was surprisingly cheap. What can you do with 6 or 7 dollars here? Excellent food large enough for a hungry stomach. Impressive!

Note: No air-condition. It could be a problem for people wishing to dine in a cool environment. and... expect to queue before some stalls and not easy to find a seat during peak hours."
,,Hawker food centre is an experience,4.0,,"I have tried out Tin Tin chicken rice as recommended by guide books. It has such a fame that even cab driver asks if I am heading to Maxwell Food Centre for Hainanese chicken.

But it does not turn out as good. I would not say it is a let down. I would have thought it is more to do with expectation.

The eating experience is fantastic itself. The petit food stalls, hanging fans and the heat. You would not want to leave Singapore without taking a bite of the hawker food."
,,Did someone say authentic?,4.0,,Very busy lunch time hawker food centre for locals. Was recommended the 'famous' tian tian chicken and the sunto gyoza. Both excellent. A bunch of hawkers competed against Gordon Ramsay to make chicken rice (maybe Singaporeans national dish #notverified) and these guys won (also #notverified). It's pretty tasty. Queue are long (full of locals tho). Hot tip is to claim your seat by putting a napkin or personal belonging on it.
,,Many good food,4.0,,"This place always my choice of recommendation to my overseas friend.
Not only does it have many variety of choice to choose from, the food there are nice too.
My preference is always the porridge, tian tian chicken rice, deep fried oyster pan cake, kampong laksa and wonton noodle.
The only disadvantage is parking. Maybe because of too many good food."
,,Yum,5.0,,"Went here a couple of times good food and well priced, the best place and somewhere with delicious food was Benri Bento the chicken teriyaki was delicious and come with a nice soup, it's got a red front and was on one of the inner rows, highly recommended ate there a few times."
,,Yummy food at a great price with atmosphere,5.0,,"Having been now several times to. Maxwell Hawker market it is always a very enjoyable visit. We went there early to grab some breakfast, ended up with roti prata and Kopi (almond and coffee, which was very yummy) to lunch (carrot cake, fried oysters and Popiah) to late afternoon, Hainense chicken from Tian Tian and some Tiger beer, we loved it every time.

I'm not clear re opening times of some of the stalls but I figure that just how it is. This is one of our fav hawker centers and I can highly recommend it."
,,BEST Hainese Chicken Rice Set,5.0,,"We ate at a few Hawker Markets in Singapore and absolutely the best Chicken Rice Set was from stall 44 - Heng Heng at Maxwell Road. I think it was about $4 or $5, so great value too. Make sure you grab some chilli sauce and ginger to spice it up if that's what you like. Delicious!!"
,,Great budget local food,4.0,,"Great budget local food at very good prices, can get a bit hot and humid but it is Singapore. Some of the service is poor but what can you expect for the price."
,,Great food all cooked in front of you,5.0,,"The Maxwell Road Hawker centre was recommended by a friend and is ideally placed being so close to China Town. Some of the stalls had queue's that were 12 to 20 people long. Must be good but we were hungry and went for several stalls close by to our table so that we could order from all of them. Chicken Rice, Pork Noodles and Char koay teow washed down by a couple of tiger beers hit the spot. The meal was $9, the beer more. The food was delicious."
,,Tips for Awesome hawker centre,5.0,,"So many choices and very inexpensive, I spent my week in Singapore trying different stuff from different stalls for breakfast and dinner. Don't necessarily follow the crowds, you'll end up eating alot of rice porridge, which personally, was far from the best thing I tried here.

Starting with drinks, the Typibon stall at the very front, facing the temple serves good coffee and the guy running it was super friendly, offering tips on where to see locally. Juice Farm was also good, with loads of smoothies/juices (avocado and apple is great) without the gallons of syrup other places bulk up theirs with.

Foodwise, try: chicken rice with veg, chilli sauce and soup from any of the stalls, oyster cakes from the red stall somewhere in the middle, carrot cake (nothing like Western carrot cake! - it's a savoury omelette with soft white radish), popiah (various fillings in a paper thin rice wrap), rojak (Malay fruit dessert) and the filled buns on the bakery stand for a quick snack. These are just some personal highlights from trying a fair amount of the stalls, expect I've missed alot, so give it all a go!"
,,Very nice local food place,4.0,,"Was there last night, the food court consists of many local food, we tried 5 different restaurants, all of them are better than my expectation. I didn't set high expectation, because from where I am from food court almost equal fast and below average food, but this is not the case in Singapore. It lives up to its expectation. The only down side is the weather was veru humid yesterday and no air conditioning, but I believe a local cold fruit drink will do the trick!"
,,Average type of hawker center,2.0,,"Wasn't too impressed with the food here. Basically same options as in other hawker center. There is one very famous Hainanese chicken called Tian Tian but the line was way too long for me so decided to get some other hainanese chicken few stall down from tian tian and some dumplings.

Location is quite easy to reach. I went to chinatown mrt, took exit A, walked til the end of pagoda street. Then i crossed the road and walk to the right till the end and the center is on the left just few meters after annsiang hill."
,,Yummy!,4.0,,"Come here for cheap and delicious food! Where else can you find a chicken rice set for Sg$5 and fried kuey teow for Sg$3, just to give you a preview of what you'll be charged. Be prepared as with all hawker centres to share a table with complete strangers."
,,Don't miss this experience!,5.0,,Don't miss this brilliant food market on your trip to Singapore! Hundreds of little mini restaurants offering an array of authentic traditional Singapore and Malaysian meals. Get yourself a delicious feast for a pittance and eat amongst the locals. We ate there 3 times and all the food is brilliant
,,Chicken Rice at Maxwell,3.0,,"It is just another Hawker centre, nothing out of the whole that you cannot find in other Hawker centres in Singapore. The so called famous Chicken rice is not much to shout about. Every hawker centre in Singapore also have at least one stall selling the same chicken rice. The Best chicken is Sansui chicken found in Soup Restuarant. There is one Soup Restuarant at Terminal 2, 2 floor at Singapore Airport"
,,Good eating,4.0,,"Went to Maxwell's just to try the Hainanese Chicken Rice at stall #01-10. The rice was flavorful, but the chicken not even close to wife's steamed chicken. At 3.50SGD, does not sound like more, but was expecting something amazing which it was not. Nothing against Anthony Bourdain for recommending this place, but there are many places with much better Chinese steamed chicken particularly with a garlic, ginger sauce for dipping. Wished had more time and bigger appetite to try noodles and other dishes. Still overall a good experience and a place to go back again and again."
,,Convinient food@resonable price,4.0,,I was in que for 20 minutes to grab Hinan Chicken Rice but was worth it. This place offers a variety of food at very reasonable rate. I recommend to avoid normal lunch hours and enjoy your food without any intervention to your table.
,,"Not fancy, but local",4.0,,"As we walked to look at the 45 or so vendors in this Hawker center, we saw a long line and joined it. While the food was fairly boring (steamed chicken/rice), it was very inexpensive and traditional for the locals. Not spotless, but watched after by a uniformed crew to keep tables cleared. If you think restaurant prices are too high in Singapore, and we didn't find that at all, a Hawker Market is the way to go."
,,"Tasty food, low prices, useful city centre location",5.0,,"We have eaten there several times. We‚Äôve always been very pleased with the food, and the popularity of the centre with locals confirms it‚Äôs good.
We prefer eating at the edge of the market, which is cooler, and often less popular, as it‚Äôs further from the food stalls. There are great views of the Temple of the Tooth from the tables on that side. Quite a few of the tables on the side are only for 2 people and are set back from the road, a pleasant quiet place to eat with great views.
Toilets available, they‚Äôre clean and free."
,,endangered species of good value and high quality food centres,5.0,,"Affordable and good value. Many of the hawker stalls are from first generation hawkers and they still cook and serve traditional fares. Other hawker centres would have diluted or distorted this traditional fares due to some hawkers renting out their space to new immigrants who know nuts about food just to profiteer. This is one of last bastion of progress and modernization when traditional centres have been redeveloped either for other purpose or renovated and the new stall owners would have to pay exorbitant rent increase so as to erode the quality of food. Go while it is still existing as it is really endangered species. Avoid lunch crowd from nearby offices. The place is clean, airy and hygienic. It is mostly self service but hawkers are friendly. Tables are regularly cleaned."
,,My favorite food center,5.0,,"Went on Sunday for lunch and once again, the selection was outstanding and all the food extremely fresh. This is where the locals go - try it and you won't be disappointed."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"An extraordinary array of outlets, all selling incredible food. Even my fussy children found plenty to enjoy."
,,One of the best food centres,5.0,,"We like the Rojak / Poh piah stall at Maxwell Road. It's awesome! Lots of other stalls with long queues. Apparently, it has one of the best Goreng Pisang stalls but both times we visited, he was done for the day. Skip Newton (tourist trap ) and go to Maxwell Road, in my opinion. It's exemplary of what a hawker centre should be."
,,Keeping traditional local food alive !,4.0,,"Food are generally good here, Value for money and try to avoid peak hours to enjoy a meal with less time queueing..."
,,Great experience,4.0,,Wonderful atmosphere and great insight into local food culture. Excellent value for money. Would recommend to anyone looking for an authentic and unpretentious lunch or dinner! It was recommended to us by a local.
,,A must try for great food,5.0,,"Visited this food court twice during our recent trip to Singapore, the Chicken rice should be on the top of your menu list, just look for the vendor with the biggest line of people waiting, the locals know which one is the best..
The carrot cake and chicken curry is also recommended..

This food centre is just a short stroll from china town.
Just don't get there too late as most of the most popular food stalls sell out of the favourite dishes early.

Most dishes range in price from $3 to $5, great value, and a must try when in Singapore.."
,,This is what Singapore food is about,4.0,,"Like most Asian countries, most of the best local food are not found in fancy restaurants. Most of the stalls in Maxwell serve good local food, and on the whole the Maxwell hawker centre is better than the average hawker centre.

A good estimate of a stall's reputation is 1) length of queue and 2) number of certificates/awards they laminate and paste on their shop front. If they have it, you will see it."
,,Popular food center for the local workers and tourists,4.0,,It is at the commercial district and Chinatown area. They serve mainly the the Singaporean and other South-East Asia cuisine with very reasonable lower price. The best Hainanese chicken rice can be found in this eating place - please note that this stall closes on Sundays and opens only up to about 2:00 pm from Mon to Sat.
,,Join the longest queue,4.0,,"A riot of different food stalls, being utter novices we joined the longest queue. We were not disappointed."
,,Many authentic local fare at very reasonable price,4.0,,"You want authentic Singapore local food, always go to hawker centre. It is usually originated from the hawkers (their parent/grandparent) at the street in 60s-70s. Atmosphere is not great but value for $$ compared to restaurants offering the similar ones."
,,One of the best hawker centre in SG,4.0,,"Most people go for 2 main kinds of food here:
1) Chicken rice - which is really very good.
There are a few chicken rice stalls but the most popular one is Tien Tien.
2) Porridge - this stall is open till wee hours of the morning (3am) and is the perfect place to go for a late night supper after a night out in the city."
,,wide variety,5.0,,"This hawker centre is one of the most famous in Sg. In addition, it is not overpriced and there's a lot of good and yummy food. I would make a trip just for this. Go before 9pm as they tend to get sold out."
,,Good food under one roof.,4.0,,"Centrally located, in the Chinatown area, you get a variety of good and affordable local food. The Fish soup is a must try, as is with the Chicken rice. Expect to wait in line, but it is well worth the wait. Fish soup is tasty, with a choice of sliced fish or fried fish, with or without milk in your soup. Chicken rice is great, I usually order the white meat, which is not a favorite with many people, but the meat is always tender, yet firm. How do they do it? A good selection of local fare is presented to you. It can get very! very! crowded during lunch and dinner, looking for a table can be challenging at times! Parking is a little bit of a challenge as well! But then again, good things comes to those who wait! Be patient for your parking lot and your table!"
,,Most delicate chicken I've ever tasted,5.0,,"Nothing comes close to this superb dish: temperature, texture, taste. Oh, the delicious tender, yet firm flesh of a probably free range chicken compares to nothing else in the world. When i first saw the white, room temperature chicken, I didn't think much of it...but, when i put it in my mouth, heaven could not wait!
The line goes on for ever at all hours, and I who does not do lines, will happily do whatever is necessary to wait for that delicious chicken. If you hunt patiently, you can find wonderful crabs and seafood and have a very cold, huge beer with it.
After the meal, you can walk it off in chinatown, which starts or ends here. You find the gorgeous temple right in front of the Centre and stock up on amulets in the open air stalls accross the street."
,,Many choices for cheap but good food,4.0,,"If you happen to be in this area (Kreta ayer area) then you can swing by this hawker centre for lots of delicious and cheap food.

For those who just came from the nearby bars and clubs for whole night of drinking and dancing then you will need to come over this place for supper before you head home. You got to try their porridge here. Do not worry there is only one shop open in the wee hours of the night that caters to night owls for supper."
,,Cheap and Good food in Singapore,4.0,,"Nice, great food in a central location of Singapore, near the Central Business District, convenient and 5-10 minutes walk from train station. Reasonable pricing for a variety of options and rich in Singapore culture."
,,"Plenty of good food in a ""hot place""",4.0,,"We have problem finding seats but before we went there we have already done our homework as this is quite common even during weekdays.This is really a center with plenty of good food in a ""hot place"". So hot and so crowded inside that it might make you a little confuse to decide which stall to go for. Well, if you don't mind the hot temperature and enjoy squeezing in between the tables, then join those long queues and taste the variety of delicious local food. After filling up your stomach, you can simply walk across the road to admire the impressive ""Foyashi"" and make a wish."
,,Super Local Chicken Rice and other local food,4.0,,"This is one of my favourite hawker centres despite it may be hot and stuffy during lunch hours. I l l like the ""Tian Tian"" chicken rice there. The queues are usually very long but the servings are rather fast. My children love the rice which is so well cooked and they can eat it without the chicken.

There are other chicken rice stalls in the centre. I will not comment them as I have never tried them.

There are other many local food such as porridge, satay, Chinese salad and etc which are good value for money.

Most of the stalls are self services and thus do not expect good services.

Please avoid Monday as most of the stalls are closed."
,,Some of the best food in Singapore,5.0,,"Great food here! The chicken rice is great, porridge & so many others.... All round good food that us locals love & great value!"
,,Authentic Local Food,5.0,,"It is not a restaurant but a collection of hawker food stalls in a eating places we call Hawker Centre. Food is cheap, it is very Singaporean, but there are plenty of good food for visitors and local alike. The chicken rice, wanton noodle, porridge are some of the recommended stalls."
,,One of the best hawker center in singapore,5.0,,"Super like this hawker center , have a good variety of food, eg: porridge and chicken rice and prawn mee, all local food"
,,Good variety and great taste,4.0,,"You can experience the typical Singapore hawker food. Variety of south east and south Asian food at cheap prices, but very hygienic. Don't forget to taste local juices, shakes and desserts."
,,Chicken Rice,5.0,,We visited this centre after watching Tony Bourdain. We have to agree that the chicken rice was superb for ¬£2.50. The queue for this stall was the biggest by far of the roughly 80 food units. We thought that the hawker centre was so good that we returned the next day and ate at two different units. Excellent value - full of local workers at lunch time. You can struggle to get a table - be patient - it is worth it
,,Great place to get fab food!,4.0,,"Don't expect silver service or fine linen on the tables but this is the place to go for seriously good food at really good prices. Our family of five ate two serves of hainanese chicken and rice from tian tian, 2 bowls of pork rib soup, 2 plates of satay and some mixed fried greens for under $25 Aussie dollars!!! A bargain in my book for the quality and quantity of food. A must try experience if you visit singapore. Be prepared to was it for a table at lunch and maybe share one with the locals who are all super friendly...don't forget to take a tissue packet to reserve your table...you can then walk away with confidence as the locals are very well mannered and won't take your spot."
,,what a choice!,4.0,,"our first meal in singapore was in this food court! be sure to be there early to find a table. great choices, real asian taste. take into account some waiting time fetching your food, especially around peak hours! very friendly prices!!"
,,Budget Friendly Local Fare,4.0,,"Visited the Maxwell Road Hawker Center upon recommendations from TripAdvisor and was not disappointed. (Hawker Centers are what they call open-air food courts in Singapore). Conveniently located across from the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Sago Street. Wide variety of Asian Cuisine, fruit juices, shakes and desserts. I had just watched the founder of Tian Tian Chicken Rice on Wok Stars on Singapore Television the night before, so I was very curious about the food stall. Sure enough, it had the longest line, so that‚Äôs where we grabbed lunch. The chicken was tender and delicious, served atop steamed rice and a couple of slivers of cucumber. Beware the chili sauce‚Ä¶. it is very, very spicy!

A FEW TIPS:
- Tables are meant to be shared, so don‚Äôt be shy about joining tables with open seats.
- Dishes ranged from S$3.50 to S$6. Be sure to bring cash.
- Definitely try one of the sugar cane drinks (S$1.50). It is absolutely refreshing after a day of shopping in Chinatown.
- Bring your own handwipes. Many of the cheaper places to eat around Singapore don‚Äôt seem to readily offer napkins."
,,Tasty,4.0,,"We ate here last night, the food was tasty, had chicken and rice, black carrot cake and some jelly concoction for dessert and beer, it's cheap and crowded but the food was good (just wished all the stalls were opened). And all stalls have a food hygiene rating displayed out the front too."
,,Casual dining with the locals...,4.0,,I am so glad that we were taken here. This is the heart of Singapore cooking. This is where all the locals go. The food is all authentic and delicious! Very cheap as well. You must try the Chicken Rice and be sure to add the thick soy sauce and hot sauce. It adds complexity to the simple dish. Enjoy a fresh coconut juice as well. Avoid the lunch crowd by either going early or after 2pm. This will help you get a seat and avoid the super long lines.
,,Cheap and cheerful,4.0,,"Probably more like 3.5 than 4. Food was good but difficult to coordinate with me and my husband going to different stalls. I took the advice offered here to find the longest queue, but he was hungry and went to a stall where he got served straight away, which meant he'd finished and I hadn't moved in the queue at all. Finally I gave up and went elsewhere. A local gentleman had joined my husband's table by now and they both watched me as I tried to eat noodles with chopsticks - not great. So an experience but not the most easy of meals I've ever had! Very, very cheap though."
,,Dirty but genuine,4.0,,"So I'm vegetarian but my partner loooooves all kinds of Asian food. She had the Congee at Zhen Zhen, the line was half an hour long at 8am. Apparently it was worth the wait!! If you don't like seafood/Chinese or foods you can't identify I'd suggest the sweets! You're relatively safe that way. My top recommendation? Try the Portuguese Egg tart!!"
,,Great,5.0,,"The nicest food I ate during my week long trip to Singapore was at this hawker centre. Had fantastic chicken rice, and popiah, and a rohjak salad that might not be to everyone's taste as it was quite sweet, but I liked it.

It's a good place to have some interaction with locals, as at busy times you might end up sharing a table. We met some friendly locals who insisted we taste the dishes they were eating.

Nice cold Tiger beer for SGD 6, which is pretty much the cheapest you will get it in Singapore.

In short, fun, atmospheric, cheap and VERY tasty. It will be one of my first stops if I return to Singapore."
,,Good fun place to visit,4.0,,We went there on a weekday lunchtime. My suggestion is to follow the crowds and go where the queues are longest with locals. I had a beef brisket with noodles and vegetables and a large bowl of wanton soup for S$8. It was hot and a bargain. I followed it up with a really nice cold drink from a shop at the end which specialises in cold drinks and coffee. Make sure you get a seat first and leave something on it like tissues etc. It is a way of reserving your place and is a nice custom. Don't be afraid to share a table as you can meet some interesting people.
,,Best place to grab some food,5.0,,"So far by favorite food court in Singapore, great selection and choices to have all different kind of food. Must try Êµ∑ÂçóÈ∏°È•≠ and ÈÖ∏ÊüëÊ∞¥„ÄÇBest combination to have both lunch and dinner, in case you are chicken lover. Laska here are great too."
,,Yum!,5.0,,"We had a marvelous time at this fun hawker centre. Lots of different stores to try, though a few were closed when we went at 5.30pm - heaps of free tables.
The stand out was the popiya from stall no. 56 - made on the spot and so delicious.
Here's what we had (for 2 people for dinner):
Chicken drumstick rice from stall no. 10 (the famous one) $4.20
Med wonton mee from stall no. 8 $4
Soya drink and sugar cane juice from stall no. 34 $2.70
Popiya from stall no. 56 $2.40
Red bean and coconut sweet potato dumpling from stall no. 76 $1.40"
,,Maxwell road Hawker Centre,4.0,,"I was there on new year eve and a week before that, the food there is good, the porridge stall at the corner, the pau store next to it sell good pau."
,,definately an experince,4.0,,"Had lunch at the maxwell rd hoawker centre. it was very busy at lunch time and a table was hard to get. we shared some chicken rice, and a few other dishes. the food was great. not one of the meals was bad or bland. very tasty and a great price. if in the area stop in and grab a bite to eat."
,,The best food in Singapore,5.0,,This place has the best choice of local food by local vendors. So many stalls and so much variety. We are disppointed we didn't stay closer so we could go again.
,,Being hooked on Maxwell Rd Hawker Centre,5.0,,"We visited Maxwell Rd Hawker Market the first time in September last year and decided to go back this trip, January 2014. We not only went back once but 3 times in 4 days and we stayed close to little India ie not close at all but this hawker centre is just marvellous.

We had Tian Tian Haianese chicken rice, some fried carrot cake, another Singaporean delight, some beers as well as some fried 'balls' can't recall the exact name but one of the balls was sweet potatoe and the other coconut with pandan. Everything absolutely delightful.

We also had roasted duck and a piece of cheesecake which was super fluffy and oh so light and yummy.

All up, can't wait to go back again next time when we are back in Singapore. Wish we'd have such wonderful hawkers market here, it's fabulous!"
,,DONT BE PUT OFF,5.0,,"After eventually finding the place,we were not disappointed my wife had roast duck on rice,3rd stall on right,I had hainese chicken rice meal,1st stall on right,both good,tasty and filling,7S$ for them both!washed down by 2 large bottles of tiger beer bought from stall as you walk in,2 large bottles cost 12S$ beat that if you can definitely worth a look!very close to china town"
,,"Great value, excellent food - local eatery",5.0,,"I stopped two chefs near my hotel (Parkroyal on Pickering) to ask them where they would go for local food and they both suggested Maxwell Road Hawker centre.
We were not disappointed with the quality of food served and were surprised how cheap it was. The Hainese chicken rice is supposed to be the best in Singapore. My son was surprised that the chicken was cold to luke warm at best and was concerned that it would upset his stomach. The others who ate it were very impressed with the meal. Excellent variety of food stalls, cheap but very good quality meals and cheap local beer! What more do you need. Just make it a point to visit this place."
,,Our Singapore canteen,5.0,,"What a great hawker centre! When we visited Singapore for a week this January the Maxwell Centre very quickly turned into out ""canteen"" - our hotel being wihtin walking distance. You can taste all the Singaporean specialities at very affordable prices here - laksa and carrot cake, oyster cakes, oyster omelette and also great Malay and Chinese food - the duck stall being our favorite (don't come too late in the evening if you want to taste the duck, this stall closes early!)"
,,A must go if you are in Singapore,4.0,,"Cheap and tasty food,you will find around 100 stalls.

Go for the Singaporean rice chicken or the very tasty noodles.

Take a walk around before choosing and always look for queues. ..if people wait 30 mins in line to be served...there is a reason!

Highly recommended"
,,Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice | Â§©Â§©Êµ∑ÂçóÈ∏°È•≠,4.0,,"Head over to Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice and try out their chicken rice. Their steamed white chicken is smooth, moist & succulent with some special made fragrant soy sauce poured onto the chicken served with fragrant rice

If you know who Gordon Ramsay is then probably you should try this chicken rice stall as the staff told us that Gordon Ramsay lost to the chef of this chicken rice stall and even Anthony Bourdain did visit his stall. So you know how good he is."
,,Great typical hawker centre!,5.0,,"This is a great and central hawker centre. Many food stalls especially for lunch. In the late evenings there are only few open ones left.
Try Chicken Rice - just go for the stand with the longest queue - and the 24/7 murtabak stall (when entering from Kadayanallur St it's the first in the furthest left row)."
,,Hawker food at reasonable prices,4.0,,"Try different stalls to get the best out of those stalls. The ones selling tapioca kueh, dough sticks, fish slice noodles,are worth a try."
,,Good soup,4.0,,"Best noodle in this food center. If you're boring with the chicken rice waiting line. This is another good choice. Good noodle with nice soup. I had noodle with fish soup, soup itself was delicious, not fishy. Noodle was well cook. Please grab your seat opposite the temple. Then enjoy your meal!"
,,Where you should be going for truly local cusine and experience,4.0,,"You might have to rely on pictures or just your senses to choose the food at maxwells so don't expect a menu you English, but there is a really wide range of choices that is also easy on the wallet. A lovely local experience."
,,Authentic and Hygenic Street Food,4.0,,"As you would expect in a city renowned for its cleanliness, even the food markets are spotless and regularly inspected. The Maxwell Road Hawker Centre offersa huge range of stalls selling whatever foods are available (we were slightly disappointed that we couldn't find any Chilli Crab but were told it was not freshly available that day so tells you something about the quality of the food). The atmosphere was busy and lively when we visited at dinner-time and we were surrounded by all of society, Office workers, young professionals, students and tourists all sat together enjoying their lunch. Far too much range to recommend one stall, however, top tips are,
1. Select the stall(s) that you would like to order from (probably a fresh juice from one and a meal from another).
2. Take a pack of tissues with you, more than just to wipe up with, find an empty seat (joining others is totally acceptable and necessary!) and place the tissues on them. This is accepted as reserving your seat whilst you queue, and the Singaporeans, being incredibly polite always respect this.
3. If there is more than one of you then split your party to different stalls to get the required food and drinks.
4. Enjoy the delicious food and fresh juices.
5. Place your now licked clean plates and rubbish onto your tray and either give to one of the passing staff or leaving on table also seemed acceptable (quite how this works with all the stalls I do not know, but I'm sure there is a system).
6. Pick a dessert and wander round to soak up the atmosphere!
All in all this is a very enjoyable and authentic was to experience Singapore life.
The Maxwell Road Hawker Centre is within easy walking distance from stops G4 and H11 of the duck tours hop-on hop-off bus tours, distinctive green and orange building, or ask your driver to point it out."
,,what more can u expect from Singapore's BEST FOOD CENTRE?!?,5.0,,"tian tian chicken rice? Over-rated. you really shouldn't waste time queueing up....

dessert stall? Yes, go ahead & cool yourself down with the ice delights!

homemade Soups? Yes, good for health but after drinking you will SWEAT BUCKETS MORE!

noodles? Plenty, to be honest, its difficult to tell which noodle stall serves the best...

on a budget of FIFTY CENTS? No prob! order the YOU TIAO( Fried Bread Stick) but you have be warned that this is the unhealthiest snacks judging from all the cooking oil that it has been soaked in...

Generally, this place is not just for eating...the visuals seeing your food being cooked, is just as entertaining!!!"
,,"Food, shopping & market",4.0,,"There are three floors to choose from. The top floor houses the food stalls - over 100 of them - offering every kind of Chinese food you can imagine at a fantastically cheap price. In front of the stalls are seating areas but you can sit anywhere - not necessarily in front of the place you purchased your food. Ate some of the best crispy pork and chicken chow mein we've ever tasted. Ground floor was mainly stalls selling clothes. Basement was the market area full of wonderful fresh fruit and vegetables. If you can stand it, worth a look to see the live fish for sale. Felt very sorry for all those frogs just waiting to be made into soup."
,,Huge selection of cheap food,5.0,,"This place is awesome and I would highly recommend it over going to the more expensive food courts. Tien Tien chicken rice is indeed overrated - the rice is fragrant but I've honestly had better actual chicken at the other stores in the same centre. The main difference is that Tien Tien seemed to provide a larger portion overall.
Would highly recommend the Lao Ban soybean desserts store. A sweet old man makes delicious soy milk and soy pudding! The char kway teo in the stores here don't taste too great though, so I'd give that a miss.
All up: 1 chicken rice $3 + 6 prawn and chicken gyoza $4 + 1 char kway teo $3 + 2 poh pia $2.40 = lunch between 2!"
,,Nice Hawker Centre with a wide variety of food,4.0,,"Curry rice, Porridge (Long queue in lunch hour), Fish soup, Fried Oyster and Fried Hokkien mee are the must tries from Maxwell. =)."
,,"great, fast and cheap chicken rice in singapore",4.0,,"hands down one of the best places to have chicken rice the correct way in Singapore. It's fast, cheap and simply DELICIOUS!!! i'm a chicken rice addict because of this place. Need i say more?"
,,Cheap and good food,5.0,,"Must try Tian Tian chicken rice- long queue, and closed on Mondays.
Buns at $1 but for limited period. Authentic Tom yam soup and Thai food cooked by Thais.
Cheap but Fresh cut fruits and the fruit juice freshly squeezed when you order it.
Must try the nyonya snacks ike oneh-oneh, kueh kosui etc.
you can do your DIY frying of the ""hum jing Pan"" at one of the stalls, where the owner will shape up the dough and you help do the frying with long chopsticks and then it is packed into a bag according to the no. of pieces you order and pay. Fun isn't it?"
,,GREAT CHOICES OF FOOD,3.0,,Local Food & worth the price..less expensive & more food choices. everyone must try it. dont give it a miss.
,,"Good Old Hawker Food, our heritage",4.0,,The hawker centre features the local hawker food which are excellent and traditional with a great touch of Singapore heritage. It is frequent by locals and we just enjoy the selection and good old hawker fare.
,,Local Buffet of Great Food,4.0,,"This is one of the places which the locals frequent. Lots of highly rated hawker food here, so you will also know which stores are famous, due to their advertising, and due to the long queues.

Avoid the Lunch crowd, as you might take a while to get your food, but the good food is worth the wait. Try the Tian Tian Chicken Rice, as it has won a few awards and it is a favorite with many locals."
,,Best authentic local hawker fare.,5.0,,"Set against a mix of patrons from tourists to backpackers to local working class from professionals and the rarely-seen local senior community, the dining experience offers a homely cosmopolitan feel that is Singapore."
,,Typically Local,4.0,,"Good variety of food but has over the year lost it shine as local street food paradise. Still stuffy under hot sun despite of several renovation. Converted from a old market site good heritage structure but a bit of crump. Avoid going there during lunch time where working people go there for meal. Good hainanese chicken rice, hokkein fritter pastries could be found there."
,,One Stop for the best of Singapore,5.0,,"I have been here quite a few times. Being close to my ex work place, I would find reasons to head here for lunch.
My 1st here was when I was passing by on a Sunday afternoon and saw a long queue outside a Chicken Rice stall. Inquisitive as I was, I explored and found it to be the famous Tian-Tian Chicken Rice.
Its a challenge to get a table here even on weekends. I tried quite a few dishes at different stalls and so far havent had a bad experience at any.
If one is out for good food and needs a dash of variety, then this is the place."
,,All the good food is gone,1.0,,"All that is famous of maxwell is no longer there.
Tian tian is a nightmare to q n the servers are so unfriendly. Asked for ginger n got a nasty look.
Rice is Ok. Chicken still fat n juicy. But no magic. I miss the old taste chicken rice. The real taste.
The place is always hot n stuffy. Very crowded. Even dirty.
The famous kway teow tng is no as good as it used to be.
The oyster cake is oily n dry n only one oyster. Sigh...
Singapore's famous hawker centers are losing their soul.."
,,"Local flavor, great prices",4.0,,"Not as touristy as Gluttony Bay and Newton Food Center, Maxwell Hawker Center caters mostly to locals, so prices are cheaper.

Since it's more popular with locals, getting a table here can be a challenge.

If you're willing to endure long lines, be sure to check out Tian Tian Chicken Rice.

The only quibble I have with Maxwell is there seems to be a lack of grilled seafood hawkers (which is abundant in Newton) when we went there, though a lot of stalls were still closed on a Saturday."
,,"Great Food, Great Price",5.0,,"If your after real local hawker food then you must visit this place. Best & cheapest dinner we had in Singapore. A whole chicken, 4 rices, 4 soups & 6 Tiger beers for under S$40.00."
,,Food Fair of Local Favourites,4.0,,"Mostly self-service.

Tantalizing choices. Ethnic mix. Traditional and fusion. Endless possibilities. Perpetual queues at popular stalls. Rub shoulders with the locals. Dine on what they feast upon. Affordable prices. Spartan yet robust meals. Fruits, juices, drinks, food. A maze of culinary temptations mostly prepared before your very eyes. Amazing variety.

Had dinner there on 28/Dec/2013. Jam packed. Hunted for own table. Had fried fritters, bean curd, fishball combo with beehoon. Won't want to single out any stall. One is as good as another depending on what you crave for.

Can buy from many stalls. See what is offered. Watch what is cooked. Truly a Reality show.

Centre management has to ensure sufficient coverage to clear and clean tables after diners are done. Collecting from refreshment area and returning cutlery to wash point, washing and returning clean cutlery to respective stalls is time consuming. With the labour crunch should switch to disposable cutlery to free up much needed clearing hands to enable quicker turnover of dining cycles. This will be good for diners and vendors alike.

Limited carpark lots at meal times. Steamy and stuffy during day service when cooking and crowds peak. Otherwise, fun."
,,Fuzhou Oyster cakes are a must-try!,4.0,,"Most of the food here seemed pretty good, but finding these oyster cakes and washing down with a cold beer was just heavenly! Do yourself a favour - get a few of these and a cold one - you will not be sorry!!!"
,,Food Fun,4.0,,"A great chance to try lots of local specialties at bargain prices. Try lots of different stalls and mix & match to experience as many dishes as possible. We enjoyed the oyster omelette, and the chicken steamed rice the most, but it is all good and very reasonably priced with most dishes in the 3 to 5 dollar range. Lots of local color as well."
,,Good selection of Chinese food,4.0,,"I came to this place to have Hainanese Chicken Rice. There are lots of stalls that selling the same dish. Many people will choose the best which has the longest queue but i don't have time for that. I picked a random one and got 1 delicious dish. A set of chicken rice with vegetable and a bowl of soup cost S$4.50. After that, i grab a tiger lemon beer which is a light beer a enjoy the pagoda view and people watching. Beer costs S$5, OMG."
,,Excellent value for money,5.0,,"This place is great, after travelling around SE Asia for a few months after, this was one of the best Hawker Markets we visited. Great value for money and a good choice of food"
,,Great cheap local eating area,4.0,,"We went here for breakfast one morning, we were the only tourists there, lots of choice & cheap, couldn't really fault it - depends what you are after...."
,,Eating with the locals!,5.0,,Food as it should be eaten! A taste of the real Singapore china town. Fresh ingredients and fabulous food. Don't miss it!
,,good food,4.0,,The place was clean. Read about Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice and we had to try it. We came around 11:30am and there was a very long line. The wait was worth it. A must try. Maxwell Road Hawker Center is also near the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and the Red Dot Museum.
,,Cheap local food,4.0,,"A cool hawker market filled with different vendors, each selling something unique and mostly local.
Most dietary options are covered. As a vegetarian I found a few decent options. The drinks and desserts are good too.
Prices are about $2-4 for a good sized meal. Perfect for a bite to eat when you're running low on cash."
,,Nicely Renovate,4.0,,I wanted to eat here in November 2012 but it was closed due to renovations. This year I was able to have lunch here. It certainly looks much cleaner than some of the other hawker centers in Singapore center so I felt much more comfortable. It felt more spacious as well as it has a high airy ceiling with many fans above (hanging from rafters). We went for congee and there is one congee place that has a humungous lineup that hardly moves. We decided to try another congee stall that was just a few stalls over and it was quick and good and actually quite popular with clients. By the time we had finished we looked over at the other stall with the lineup and saw that we would still have been in the lineup..
,,Local Flair!,4.0,,"Loved it! Food was delicious! This is a ""must-try"" when visiting Singapore. My husband loved the chicken rice. I was a bit more adventuresome and had rojak and popiah!"
,,Great place,4.0,,"Canteen food, tasty very cheap, smoothie type drinks and alcohol very cheap, this is real sing, you must leave any preconceptions and try."
,,Nice place,4.0,,A lovely place to sample the autentic food of Singapore. After a lot of browsing I ended up with a fish ball soup that tasted very good.
,,The way to go in Singapore.,4.0,,"Just a few minutes stroll from Chinatown, this is the place you want to be to experience the food of Singapore. We went for the Hainan chicken and rice at Tien Tien, made a bit famous by Anthony Bourdain. And, famous it is, as the line at this one stall extended out of the building. The meal was worth it and a young British expat lawyer who shared a table with us said that it is also a great meal to cure a hangover. She also pointed out another stall featuring the same meal, run by the former chef at Tien Tien with no line at all. Same meal, no line. But don't let yourself be limited by this one meal! There is every type of Southeast Asian food one can imagine here, so let yourself be tempted."
,,Must visit,4.0,,"I had lunch at the Maxwell Road Hawker Centre on Sunday and really enjoyed the food and the experience. A bit far from China town station. It will take 10 mins to walk there. It is good way to experience Singaporean life style. So many stalls to choose from, Singaporean food, Malaysian food, Indonesian food, even Lao food. The dishes are really cheap too so you get the chance to order things you may not normally order.
Articles and good comments were given to Tian Tian Chicken Rice as the best Chicken rice in Singapore. And it was right. Try it once and enjoy as I did!
A must visit for every trip to this island"
,,Home of the best chicken rice in Singapore.,4.0,,"It has been 7 days since we arrived in Singapore on a culinary trip. We have tried food courts, hawker centers, restaurants and little kiosks along the way.

On the 7th day we made it here just to try looking for the Tien Tien Hainanese Chicken rice. It was the only stall I noticed that took 2 spaces in the hawker center. The line was loooong so it took us about 15min to get to the front and to order. This kiosk has very good reviews among the Singaporean blogger and sure enough. better than the few we tasted in other food centers. The chicken is flavorful and it melts in your mouth i think.
The rice was the tastiest among the ones we tried before. This reminds me of Chicken rice back in the days when i was living here in the early 80s. Lots of the flavor have been diluted through generations and I guess urbanization?

While you are here try out the curry puff place called Tangling Crispy Curry Puff. Again the filling reminded me of my school days in Singapore. Awesome!!!!

Wished we had more space in the stomach but we had to move on to another place for another dish!!!"
,,A Eating Mall,3.0,,"huge range of food for you to choose here, the value is very good and taste is not bad. The environment is not good if you come here in Summer, there's no air con. So, In autumn or winter it's much comfortable."
,,Tien Tien at Maxwell Center: Over rated,2.0,,"Praised as the best Hainese Chicken in Singapore in the food hawker center in south Chintown. There are multiple stands selling Hainese Chicken at MC but only Tien Tien has a line. The prices are $3 SGD for regular chicken & rice, $5 SGD for double meat & rice. In short, the dish fall way short of high expectations. Poached white meat chicken is moist but lacking of any favor and the star of the dish is the favored rice but once again did not give me or my dining mates any WOW. This is an OK dish at Tien Tien."
,,A lot of stalls to try,4.0,,"Maxwell open daily from 11am - 09pm. Some of the food stalls were closed before 9pm. This place was really confuse me, i mean, there were a lot of food stalls that i wanted to try. The first time i came to Maxwell, i went around for couple times to decide what food i wanted to eat. Price was very affordable and the food was delicious especially the chicken rice, beehoon fish and oyster omelet. What i didn't like about this place was that the crowd. At night (dinner time) it was hard for me to find empty table."
,,Hainan chicken rice,2.0,,"Hainan chicken rice located at maxwell food centre , the price of the food is relatively cheap , required to take long queue before you can taste it , however it is not worth at all , taste 2/10 rough chicken :("
,,Don't go here if you have problems taking a descision,5.0,,"Soo much great food to taste. So many stalls with different offerings. Cheap, quick and really tasty! So much worth visiting, enjoy!! We did"
,,Huge selection!,4.0,,Home of a number of well regarded eateries. Look for the big lines as they are likely to be the best picks. So many choices. We spent a while looking at what other people were eating to whet our appetite.
,,I love strolling around for exotic food,5.0,,"If you only have time for one foodcentre/hawker centre to satisfy your craving for true-blue Singapore food, this is the place. Great food, hot, spicy and tastes great. Drinks are usually ordered separately via roving sellers."
,,Awesome place for local food,5.0,,"This place has all types of food that you should try when you're in Singapore. My favourite was the Popiah shop, which was selling them for $1.20 each. Popiah is a fresh spring roll filled with saut√©ed and fresh vegetables in a rice wrapper. These were absolutely delicious and perfect for the warm weather. I also tried the famous Tian Tian Chicken Rice, which was good but didn't exceed my expectations. Satay sticks were also great as well as the char kway teow and the laksa on offer. I came by myself initially during the day then ended up coming for dinner the following day. It's a great hawker centre that is fairly clean, not too crazy and pretty close to the city centre."
,,Great hawker centre...,5.0,,"It was hard to find a seat at the Maxwell Food Centre so my partner and I knew that the food was going to be good there. The place itself is old but well maintained and clean and you know which stalls are the best from their long queues. I was a little deterred by the long queues but thanks to my partner having more patience than me and waiting 30mins for food, I got to try Tian Tian's Hainanese chicken rice. I highly recommend visiting this stall. I also recommend trying the black carrot cake.

Next time I visit Singapore I will go back here and order the smaller dishes so I can try more food!"
,,Why do half the stalls close so early?,4.0,,"We visited Maxwell Food Centre twice during our 3 days stay in Singapore last week. The first time was mid-morning and we simply stopped to have a drink- one of the amazing fruit combination drinks that are on offer there which are absolutely delicious. We managed to find the stalls that we wanted, in particular the famous Tian Tian chicken rice stall which had a long queue in front of it, so we made a mental note and moved on. We then decided to return the following evening for dinner which we did but to our surprise and disappointment, when we arrived about 9 p.m. half the stalls were already closed including Tian Tian which we particularly wanted to try. Obviously there were still enough stalls open to allow us to have some lovely food but there wasn't much in the way of atmosphere as the place was half empty! Nowhere in any of the information I had on Maxwell Food Centre did it mention that some stalls closed early in the evening, which is why we were so surprised. Anyway, not a problem as we will definitely go back for lunch next time when Tian Tian and other stalls are definitely open. We were also surprised to see that Lau Pa Sat is closed for renovation at the moment but no-one seemed to know how long it would be closed. Because of this we went to Glutton's Bay for dinner one evening and had the chili crab which was fine but not that memorable. Glutton's Bay is a great alternative to Lau Pa Sat- clean, organized and very pleasant and, what's even better, right next to the Esplanade theatres. Hawker Centres in Singapore are fantastic- such good food and with very affordable prices!"
,,Fantastic place. Inexpensive and Well Maintained. Nice area.,5.0,,"A nice place. Old but well maintained. Inexpensive and very tasty food. The central courtyard type hall might leave you a little claustrophobic, but the outer verandahs are neat. The food is tasty and the staff decent. Plates are cleared very quickly and tables are available most of the time. We stayed close to this place (for a week almost) and did not once regret the visits. Whenever, we returned late close or even past midnight, this hawkers' center was always available to get a hot bowl of rice/noodles or even hot milk/milo for the child. Very nice indeed. And as with most places, one need not worry about going with the family or alone to such places in Singapore. Very safe and well policed."
,,foods and more foods,4.0,,fantastic place to eat the SG's chicken rice and other cuisine. very cheap and clean. loads of foods to choose from...
,,Must do in Singapore,5.0,,"Fabulous hawker market in the heart of Chinatown. Finding a table may be a challenge, but once you do, grab a drink and sample delights from multiple stalls - really great food!"
,,Good & cheap local delights,4.0,,"Although a little rundown, the place was relatively clean & well-maintained. There are several stalls selling good food- you can tell from the queues. Sometimes, it's hard even for us locals to decide what to eat.

A quick tip? These few dishes are pretty good:

,,Good food!,4.0,,"Wide variety of foods. Amazing fruits choice.
Tasty, affordable.
Open until very very late.
A bit noisy. They shout when an order is ready.
Try not to sit in front of a closing garage, because the cleaning process might amaze you, in terms of water falling in your feet."
,,Nice place,3.0,,"We arrived here at 01.00 am on sat morning. Some of them are still open, but only the congee is the best. While mostly they have closed, but it is great for someone who crave for food in the middle of the night."
,,Variety of great food,5.0,,"Absolutely loved it, the place was buzzing during lunch time with many workers queuing up for their food. It is clean, well maintained and provides plenty of choices. I was on the lookout for carrot cake (savory that is) super yummy can highly recommend it. The fruit juices were yummy as well and of course many many meals. Also beer can be bought to an excellent price."
,,Delicious. You've got to go,5.0,,"We visited maxwell food centre having been recommended by a friend who lives in Singapore. So pleased he did. Had a really tasty lunch for about ¬£2-3 a dish. There are loads of different stalls, so it's worth a visit just for the interest and atmosphere. My husband rated this as one of his most memorable meals all trip, it was that good! Taxis are cheap in Singapore so make sure you fit this in on your visit"
,,good for the price,4.0,,There's so many vendors at maxwell food court that it took us about 4 circuits of the building to decide what place we wanted. We settled for some mixed meats and noodled from restaurant 71 and being western the shop owner seemed overly nice and friendly andhad a good Convo. The food was tasty and alright value for the small amoiunt of $3.80 so no complaints really.
,,Great place to visit and see - but my food was cold,4.0,,"I reviewed Tian Tian separately so I won't get into those details. I was checking out Chinatown on a Saturday and decided to take a look at the Maxwell Centre. It's very neat and interesting with a whole range of food and drink offerings. It was really a sight to see and explore - the offerings were very reasonable, too. I highly recommend a stop here, for anyone visiting Singapore."
,,Amazing food and culture experience,5.0,,"So much great food to chose from!! You really are spoiled for choice, open till late too which is an added bonus. Great buzzing atmosphere and great food. Everything looks clean and tidy and having eaten here many many times I have never had any problems. Would highly recommend!"
,,A good place to taste Singapore Foods,5.0,,"For any of my foreign friends to come to Singapore, I always brought them to Maxwell Hawker Centre to taste our local food, this is not a restaurant, but a place make up of more than 50-60 food stalls selling various delicious and cheap local food. An average meal will costs $3-$7 dollar.

Transport:
The hawker Centre is located between Tanjong Pagar and Chinatown, You can take a cab, bus or train, however I will recommend to take the MRT train to Tanjong Pager MRT station and take a 5-7 min walk toward the Hawker Centre.

Timing:
Although this hawker centre open from 7am to 7pm (some of the stalls may open till 9pm, however quite a number of stalls closed after the lunch period) I will recommend to visit this place at 11am to avoid the lunch crowd and able to taste of some of the best foods found in this hawker centre like tropical kueh which usually sold out about 1pm. Please try to avoid Monday as most stall closed in Monday

What to order:
Everything are good, but the followings orders must not be missed. Chicken Rice from Tian Tian, one of the most authentic Singapore style chicken rice, the rice is very fragance and the chicken is tender, (order the drumstick if you not sure which chicken part to order). My next recommendation will be the porridge from Zhen Zhen, it belong to Hong Kong style of porridge with full of ingredient, really value for money, please do order the raw fish from the same stall which cost $3 for small plate, this will be a perfect combination for your porridge, the problem is you need to wait at least half to an hour for your order. Next will be the Sliced Fish Bee Hoon frorm Jin Hua, this is my favourite slice fish Fish Bee Hoon stall. Fresh ingredient in cantoness style milky fish soup, yummy! Be prepared to wait even in off peak period. Another star-order is the tropical kueh which you can find the last row of the hawker centre, it sell out very fast by 1pm it usually sold out. If you still have space for dessert, either the peanut soup (stall name is 75 peanunt soup) or the peanunt ice -kachang (which just locate beside the peanut soup stall). Choose 1 of them as peanut soup is hot desser while peanut ice-kachang is a cold dessert.

Tips : Just order the small portion for each food you order in order to try out as many dishes as possible. Please be prepared the place maybe hot and a bit dirty to some of them, but the delicious and cheap food should able to make up for it. Worth a visit and you will in love with this place.

Give me a helpful vote if you think the above info and my recommendation helpful to you."
,,A lot of Food to try,4.0,,"Just 10 minutes walk from Chinatown MRT Station. Go to Pagoda St and at the end of Pagoda Street just turn right and cross the street, and walk a couple minutes you will find Maxwell Food Center on your left. A lot of food to try. I try fish head soup and it taste nice. You can try anything attract you. You will see a long queue at Hainam Chicken Rice, it said that it has great taste but unfortunatelly I didnt try it."
,,Good place to experience Food Amalgamation in Singapore!,4.0,,"Likes: Chinese Greens at Stall 6, and ginger soy Fried Rice. A stall with an old woman serving dumplings of different sorts. Chives and pork is quite yummy.
Dislike: Pricing. You almost spend 6-8sgd per person for a hearty meal. Almost same as a 2 or 3 star restro which is airconditioned!"
,,If you love hawker style food - you'll love this. Just great!,5.0,,"We eat at Maxwells whenever we visit Singapore. And why wouldn't you? With a vast array of delicious and fresh food and beverage options at ridiculously good prices, you really can't go wrong. There's truly something for everything here.

Buy a few small plates of different things to share to really get an opportunity to try lots of interesting food.

Can't wait to go back. Yum!"
,,No complaint,4.0,,Everything about Singaporean food can be found cheaply here. Location is easy to reach and can combine with the tour of Chinatown.
,,How could you not love this place,5.0,,"The food in this hawker centre was some of the best I have ever eaten. From the Hainanese chicken rice to the duck to the wonderful fruit juices everything was amazing, inexpensive and not changed for foreign palates. This is a must do for any culinary adventurer who comes to Singapore and is one of the main reasons I want to go back. The prices are ridiculously low too."
,,Something for everyone,5.0,,"If you can't find something here at a reasonable price then I don't know where you will.

Just on the edge of Chinatown, wander round until you see something you fancy - look for queues of locals for the very best stalls. Mix and match as you please and then eat at one of the tables in the central areas.

Note that there are two halls of stalls - it's easy to miss one or the other depending which side you arrive at."
,,Cheap and delish,4.0,,"Of the many Hawker Centres visited on my trip to Singapore, in terms of food this was definitely the best. Lots of options, lots of seating and most of the food made to order. Definitely worth a look."
,,Must go there,5.0,,"It was incredible, the different stalls and food available It is so cheap and clean, If you don't get to go any where else this place is a must go."
,,This is a must,5.0,,The food is amazing. Fresh juices and coconuts. Super cheap and full of flavour. Chicken rice is the most famous dish here and we can see why. So delicious.
,,A of the better hawker centre,3.0,,Good variety of food. See where the queues are will indicate good stalls to try. It is close to Chinatown where the old time favorites are.
,,A must do if you like doing (eating) what the locals do,5.0,,"Amazing food market, best Asian food I have ever had by a mile. Hundreds of little food stalls selling everything you could think of asian food wise, thai, malaysian, indian, chinese, japanese, nepalese and so on. Had tom yam noodle soup with crispy chicken for just 4 SGD, thats about 2.25GBP and it could have fed two!"
,,Great Choice and Food,5.0,,"There is well over 100 food vendors here. It is mainly Chinese Food but has a variety. There is a lot of locals along with tourists. The food we ate was excellent and very well priced. Roughly $5 per plate of food. If you want to have a beer, then have a seat close to one of the beer vendors and they will check on you and bring more beer if you want. Walk around and try the different food. It is worth your time and money!"
,,Local flavor,5.0,,"Great place to visit for some local flavour. Small food stalls each with their own specialty, WOW, great food and great atmosphere. Cost effective and fun! Busy, noisy and hard to find a seat but worth it!"
,,Good food but little atmosphere,3.0,,We found most hawker food centres in Singapore of similar high quality. It was good for poh piah and chicken rice. We liked Lau Pa Sat the best on Raffles Quay. In an atmospheric old colonial building. Specialises in charcoal grilled satays and seafood.
,,"meh, because some stalls closed",3.0,,"The chicken rice that beat ramsey is here, but was closed when we visited. The rest of the food was meh - Tiong Bahru seems nicer. The design of Maxwell also makes the place doubly warm. I think it traps the hot air, and was unbearable on the day we visited."
,,Lots of choice. Really great food.,4.0,,"I had lunch at the Maxwell road center on Saturday and really enjoyed the food and the experience. I was amazed at how long the queues could be for some of the stalls (especially the chicken and rice stall visited by Anthony Bourdain). I ended up eating across the hall from the chicken and rice stall and chose the black carrot cake, which was excellent. Seating was easy to find, but expect to share a table with others. Typically if there is a tissue or napkin on the seat, it has been saved by someone who is waiting to get food. Try to find another seat. I also had some really great green tea flavored bean curd dessert, that you could also get in strawberry, almond, durian, and other flavors. The lunch crowd was not so bad, but it was a Saturday. The location was also great because after filling up on food, you could spend some time walking it off in Chinatown."
,,Good experience to local life,5.0,,A bit far from China town station. will take 10 mins to walk there. A huge food centre. And many different food stalls. It is good way to experience Singaporean life style. Love Hainan Chicken rice and Lao Ban Tofu pudding
,,Raw fish from a hawker stand?? YES!!,5.0,,"I did not get to try tian tian's chicken rice, but i had various other foods there. Specifically the gyoza and my friend got us some raw fish sort of like a sashimi dish were both really really good! I was a bit sceptical about the raw fish cuz where i'm from you have to be sure about the place where you get and eat raw foods from but it was very good. The gyozas were also super yummy, with a lot of filling and the fried ones were very crispy but not overly :)"
,,Very cool place,4.0,,"Local eating venue- three full rows of vendors making all sorts of amazing and reasonably priced dishes. Crowded, noisy, kinda hot and really fun- great place to experience local food at great prices."
,,Winner winner chicken dinner,4.0,,Had my dinner in the hawkers centre off maxwell street following a recommendation from a friend. Wasn't 100% sure which stall would b best so I just went with the one with the longest queue and it didn't disappoint! Chicken was so tender and it is unbelievable value! Def recommend it if your around the Chinatown area
,,A lot of food to try,3.0,,"If you want to try locaL food of singapore, you can try it here. There're a lot of choices. And its crowded. I try Jin Hua Fish Meat Bee Hoon, as the queue is quite long, made me want to try. A bowl of bee hoon cost SGD 5. The taste is nice. The broth is milky and delicious, the fish meat is great. It's worth to try"
,,Something for everyone!,5.0,,Love this place - so cheap and great choices. Particularly love Juice Farm in the mornings for a dragonfruit amd yoghurt drink and a coconut.
,,Go for the chicken rice,4.0,,"We went to Maxwell specifically for the chicken rice and was saddened that Tian Tian was closed when we got there however the stall nearby (Ah Tai Chicken Rice) had a lengthy queue which turns out to be the ex-chef of Tian Tian.

Though I cannot compare Ah Tai to Tian Tian I have to say this was the best chicken rice I've ever tasted, the chicken was so succulent. You will not regret queuing for this trust me."
,,Great local experience!,5.0,,"We had lunch there. Full of differents small stalls selling indian; chinese, singapore food. Difficult to decided but at the end everything was good! Friendly astmosphere. Cheap prices."
,,Simply the best singaporean hawker food!,5.0,,"We went there two times in a row. You must try the Tian Tian Chicken rice (delicious!) and the fish soup, you will see where the best are because they always have a line. And for the fresh juices, the best is stall 84, you can't miss it!"
,,Great Porridge,5.0,,"Just find porridge, traditional, long queue but tasty! I like it a lot! a bowl of porridge, maybe it's enough for two person:)"
,,The Thai Food is good here,4.0,,"Very relaxed atmosphere and one of a famous list of Hawker Centers. Order the Thai food, and say NO MSG. It's good."
,,Heaven,5.0,,"I love love street foods and coming to Asia is always about it
for me. It is a lost art and o e that is usually passed down from one generation to another but it is a dying trade, so I always eat as much as i can. So many choices, portions are relatively small compared to western diets but thats the great thing about this concept, keep ordering!!!"
,,Low Budget Place for eat,4.0,,"Below 10 $SGD, located near the China town and Tanjong Pagar MRT. If you want to eat with low budget, I suggest you to eat here during your time at singapore. But, if it's in my country i will be rate it as average. Because you will find better place to eat with budget like this."
,,Brilliant hawker centre in Chinatown,5.0,,There are plenty of choices and the food is amazingly cheap. A generous serve of chicken rice is only $3. We preferred this place over Lau Pa Sat.
,,Very rustic and hard to pick the right vendor,3.0,,"We arrived at the centre at about 7.30pm and many of the popular vendors had already sold out and were closing up. This meant we were left with some of the B Grade vendors, resulting in a very dodgy chicken rice (mainly raw chicken) and some pretty average dim sum. It sounds like the plan has to be to get there at 6pm and battle the crowds for the top vendors. It was an interesting experience but I wouldn't go back unless a local took me."
,,Good option for cbd dwellers..alternative to amoy street food.,4.0,,Short walk from amoy food centre..love the thunder tea rice stall.very healthy alternative.n quiet filling! Should try the popiah n malay indian stalls here as well. All in all a balanced hawker centre. But it would leave veggie s a bit disappointed..too few vegetarian options..
,,Food Heaven,5.0,,"Where do I begin. This place brought back childhood memories. Since I am Guyanese/Trinidadian, eating at the food stalls was looking being in grandma's kitchen as and 8 year old. I had roti chenai and teh tarik EVERY morning here and then the chicken rice for lunch. If all you do is go to Singapore just to eat then you might as well eat here."
,,A sea of local food!,5.0,,"Had read what a huge selection of cheap good food is available so didn't eat all day. I was not disappointed! So many stalls to choose from, Singaporean food, Malaysian food, Indonesian food, even Lao food. The dishes are really cheap too so you get the chance to order things you may not normally order. Being with a group of friends was great as we all ordered different stuff and shared. Remember it is a hawker market so don't expect too much service / decor wise, but it is full of locals so a really lively / fun atmosphere. We were there for 3 hours and left stuffed and very happy."
,,High concentration for numerous local cuisine ...,3.0,,"Must Tries:
- Tian Tian Chicken Rice
- Lao Ban Bean Curd
- Zhen Zhen Porridge
- Jin Hua Fish Head Bee Hoon
- Hup Kee Wu Siang Guan Chang

Walking distance from Chinatown ... definite must try location for lunch ... but be prepared for long queues ...

* Most stalls are closed after 4pm."
,,great way to sample a diverse range of foods,5.0,,I was overwhelmed here - so many hawker stalls and so many varieties. You really have to come here on an empty stomach and a group of friends so you can try many different dishes. In addition to Singaporean food there are also Malay food which is more curry based. Of course when in Singapore - I had to try the chicken rice which was delicious - especially the rice which is steeped in chicken broth. Also had some roti and curry - another must try when in Singapore. Chili crabs yum. This place is a foodie's paradise and worth the visit.
,,Stalker for the Hawker,5.0,,"Loved it here and dreaming to return. There are endless options for chowing down. I left my heart at Xian Xian for its chicken rice....one of many food stalls that will leave you delightfully happy and satisfied.

Plan to spend as much time as possible eating, digesting, eating, digesting and people watching."
,,Thai food,5.0,,"The Thai fried rice with chicken from the lady on the end of the first row of shops is amazing! I spiced it up with the chili flakes, and enjoyed every bite! Very reasonable at $4. Several times I got an extra order to go, and it always heated up well :) I also loved the Orchard Road banana fritters. They are made with rice flour, which is great for me, since I am gluten intolerant. I miss you Maxwell Hawker Center!!"
,,A rundown Hawker Center,3.0,,"There is so much good remarks on this Hawker Center. Articles and good comments were given to Tian Tian Chicken Rice as the best Chicken rice in Singapore. I went there just to try out. I was very dissapointed as it does not taste as good as it claimed. Only people overated it. I have tried a much better chicken rice in Malaysia-Seremban.
Tanglin curry puff is delicious.

In my opinion, it is not worth while to go there deliberately just for lunch. As you have to walk for about 10mins from Mrt Tanjung Pagar to reach there. However, if you are around that area, you can give it a try."
,,Good selection,4.0,,"Visited Dec '11.

Ate here after visiting the Tooth Relic which was just across the street. Most locals like students & employees eat here so try to avoid the lunch time or go early. They have a wide selection of singaporean food at reasonable prices. Only draw is that it can be hot in the middle of the day since it's open air."
,,Wow!,4.0,,"A new experience for me to eat in a place that was so hot I was worried that the food would spoil before I ate it. There were so many choices and they were all very good. Make sure you get carrot cake! Its not cake as I know it, but it's not to be missed!"
,,Lots to choose from,3.0,,Went at the end of the night and there were still lots to choose from. We regretted not getting there earlier as we felt we were getting the end of night leftovers and the freshest. Not their fault though. Beer nice & cold & very friendly staff where we went. We felt the food in People Park Centre (not the complex) was cheaper & superior.
,,Best Place for Authentic Singaporean Food,5.0,,"They have everything from Indian, Chinese and Japanese to Filipino Cuisines. This is the home of Lao Ban that sells delicious Almond Soya Beancurd. People don‚Äôt queue for this soya for nothing and you really have to be there early because as early as 11:00 am, they already ran out of stock. Never miss a chance to sample every food here. It is like a fusion of restaurants but only cheaper yet delicious. And what I also love about this place is I get to take home my coffee via a plastic receptacle ‚Äì all you need is just a straw and voila, coffee on the go!"
,,The Noodles are OK,3.0,,Simple food. Very cheap - the average bowl of noodles is S$8. The place we ate at - not sure it has a name was quite good. Walk around and see what people are eating and if it looks OK sit down and enjoy.
,,great food at great prices -locals eat here & that's good enough for me!,4.0,,3 long rows of Hawker stalls on both sides - must be 50+ different places to choose a huge variety of excellent food from.
,,The real taste of local Singaporean food,4.0,,"One of the oldest hawker centers in Singapore that has since been conserved and upgraded/retrofitted, it is located in the center center and a 10-minute walk away from the Tanjong Pagar Mass Rapid Ttransit (MRT) Station.

The layout of the place is divided into four long rows parallel to its length, with two rows facing the sides, and two internal rows. The two outside rows have tables and seats fronting a row of hawker stalls, while the internal rows have hawker stalls on both sides.

Before deciding what to eat, take your time to slowly look at what each stall offers. Usually, you will find a longer queue in front of the more popular and well-known stalls. You are free to choose a table anywhere within the hawker center and can buy food from any of the stalls for consumption at your table. Most of the stalls are self-service, i.e. after you order the food, pay, wait for it to be prepared, pay, then carry the dish to your own table. Trays are provided at each stall for that purpose.

The place is open-air and not air-conditioned, but there are ceiling fans. It can get a bit hot and stuffy if the place is crowded.

One suggestion is to have lunch at the place, then cross over North Bridge Road to visit Chinatown. An alternative is to visit Chinatown first, then have dinner here."
,,Consistently scrumptious,4.0,,"Been here twice, each time on a stopover from Australia....sure, the queue can be a pain but its all worth it for soft succulent meat and ultra smooth skin doused by an awesome sauce. The rice is also richly coated by a chicken oil that adds an addictive aroma that complements the chicken.

A must visit for every trip to this island"
,,Good food but lacks atmosphere,3.0,,"As others have stated, there are great food options at Maxwell Road Hawker Centre. My wife and I enjoyed specific dishes from a variety of stalls that are well known for those dishes. No complaints with the food.

However, when we visited early in the evening after sunset, we found many stalls to be closed. Further, we simply did not love the atmosphere of this hawker center. We thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere offered by Lao Pa Sat at night.

Prices felt less expensive here than Lao Pa Sat, but we agreed we would rather pay more for the Lao Pa Sat experience."
,,"Yes, my favourite spot to eat.",5.0,,I loves this spot. Went there on my first day in Singapore and kept going back at least once a day for the rest of my trip. Get into the curry rice and chicken rice its unbelievably good!
,,Best hawker market!,5.0,,We stayed in Chinatown so it was only 3 minutes from our hotel to this center. It is very clean and well organized. The food options are fantastic. It was a great experience and I can't wait to visit again!
,,Very busy great place for local 'observing',3.0,,"best lime juice we found here-down the first isle-hard working couple run it! Look for the long lines-best parata and dahl for breakfast and very popular. Phad thai was poor. Bean curd at porridge place was creamy and portion enough for 4.Don;t be afraid to jump in and order , outsiders will get the hang of it after a couple visits."
,,Better than most hawker centres,5.0,,"In Singapore, the best way to try the local fare is to go to a hawker centre. Maxwell Road Hawker Centre, a short walk from Chinatown is one of the better ones. From Techew porridge, to Hainanese chicken rice and other local delicacies, there is something for every palate here."
,,"Many Choices, Nothing Great",2.0,,"Maxwell no longer serves up great hawker fares like it used to. It's not bad. But there are others. It no longer has the best chicken rice, or the best hokkien fry fry thingy. Or anything else. It's just average. To rate a hawker centre is rather ambitious, since it's almost impossible to do, without excluding the many other better tasting food in other hawker centres. Good Hawker food is spread out far and wide in Singapore. And Maxwell is far from being the mecca of them, to be in the top 50 in tripadvisor."
,,I would live here if I could.,5.0,,"We only got to try 10 stalls. We kept repeating Tian-Tian which was terrific despite Anthony Bourdain's endorsement. I always thought that would be the kiss of death because the place would be mobbed but hey Anthony guess what, it's still great. The dishes throughout the numerous stalls couldn't have been more than 7USD. Beverages 2USD non-alchoholic."
,,Love hawker food,4.0,,"Good location, good spread of choices. I wanted a few extra stomachs to try everything!! Tried the chicken rice and also the fish fillet noodles. Both long lines and both quite tasty. Will definitely return next time to try other things!"
,,OK,3.0,,"Its ok. Food variety is there but again like lau pa sat, too much msg and same style of cooking. Gone are the authenic taste"
,,Best authentic asian food in Singapore,5.0,,This is hands down some of the best asian food we have had on our 6 months in SEA. Coffee was also to die for
,,Authentic and very popular,4.0,,For a real taste of singapore head to this hawker centre and head straight for the stall with the longest line. You will not be disappointed.
,,Chinese Food Galore,5.0,,"This is an excellent hawker area. The basic food that we bought are the following:
1. Hainanese Chicken --> Very good
2. Hainanese Rice --> Very good
3. Oyster Cake --> not so good
4. Hofan Noodle --> Good
5. Shark Meat Meal --> Good
6. Satay Noodle --> very good
7. Sugar Cane juice (only 1.5 SGD) --> very good

The food we ordered are basically playing around 5-8 SGD. These are very cheap and has large servings. I would recommend tourists to go to this area especially during the night. It is very lively. The sugar cane juice is also a must try. It is not so sweet and has a natural smell of bamboo when you drink it."
,,Good selection,4.0,,"The Maxwell road hawker centre has lots of choice at reasonable prices. Located in chinatown it's ideal for a quick snack or you main meal

There is lots of choice and many different foods to chose from

Definately go to the lady selling the flavoured sweet potatos rolls, they were really nice, and dead cheap!"
,,Hungry??,4.0,,Tian Tian Hianese Chicken - blue stall on the left in the first corridor does the best chicken rice in china town.
,,Great food great prices,5.0,,It is hard to want to o to 'posh' restaurants when the quality of the food in the hawker centres is so good. This one being just off china town unsurprisingly is more Chinese orientated dishes.
,,The hainan chicken is as good as they say!,5.0,,"Loved this hawker market, easy to spot at the end of Chinatown, with its orange and white roof. Very clean and probably over 100 stalls but easy to see which one was the famous Tian Tian Hainan Chicken and Rice stall, huge queues before 12 noon. Was it good? Yes, very good and for $3.50 which is probably about ¬£2 with a bowl of soup as well, you can't knock it. Will definitely go back before we leave!"
,,Chicken Rice,4.0,,"You come here for one thing - Tian Tian's legendary Hainanese Chicken Rice - and it is worth the wait. Even Anthony Bourdain has been there.
The overall hawker centre is wonderful, clean and with a great selection of SE Asian food styles. As with all of them it is open air but undercover and patient is required if you're waiting at Tian Tian but grab a table, a drink and later dessert from elsewhere and enjoying the food and the people watching. It seems as popular with locals as with tourists - always a good sign."
,,Great food choices!,4.0,,"Personally, I think Singapore is Asia's food haven. And in Maxwell Hawker food centre, you will find the most of yummy asia food at an affordable price. Home of awesome food such as Chicken Rice (tian tian hainanese), Raw fish salad and porridge (zhen zhen porridge), fish soup (in front of zhen zhen porridge), mee siam, hor fun, herbal soups, stir-fried noodles, sugarcane juice and grass jelly drinks. One booth also offers Thai food such as Tom Yum, green curry chicken, mango salad and pineapple fried rice. One meal with drinks will cost you less than 10sgd. Ofcourse, this is Hawker center, expect long queues and unairconditioned eating area."
,,Tasty food,5.0,,"I had a few meals here - chicken rice, duck rice, snacks, drinks and many many more. They were all tasty!"
,,Foreigner Travelers: You Want to Eat Here,5.0,,"If you are a ""traveler"" rather than a mere ""tourist"" and want to eat what the locals eat for an authentic taste of Singapore, you want to come here. Hawkers Centres are what make Singapore famous and this local gem has the famous Tian Tian Chicken Rice Stall #10 and the Ah Tai Chicken Rice Stall #7, where the previous head chef of Tian Tian opened business to compete with his former employer (Google the rivalry story and enjoy the drama with your chili sauce condiments). I have tried both and the Hainan Chicken Rice is delicious with either store. In addition, try the absolutely heavenly fried tarot cake stall -- very much like the Zeppoles of Little Italy, New York, and equally as addictive. Wash it down with one of the many fresh fruit juice stalls. Yes, the location is open air (and therefore hot) and the ambience is not the most romantic, but all that fades away with your first bite of the Chicken Rice, or Fried Quay Teow (another Singaporean specialty of fried rice noodles), or fried tarot cake. Once you've eaten here, you will be back again someday -- it's that good."
,,Don't go to Aspirasi Chicken Rice stall,1.0,,The food at Aspirasi stall is no longer superb as before. The current guy is so unfriendly and there's no more crispy bits and worst of all no more soup due to peak hrs. I am not going to that stall again. I still prefer the old uncle than this young guy.
,,"Good, fun experience",3.0,,"We were quite late in arriving at Maxwell's which meant quite a few of the stall were closing down. As a vegetarian I did struggle to find suitable foods. The vegetarian on offer was tofu with fish through so that would not do. The others in our group had hainanese chicken which they said was good. A few days later we went to another hawkers market behind the big Buddhist temple , in the Chinese quarter and it was much bigger and did have a a greater selection of food and drink, so if I we going again for a hawkers meal I think I would go there instead."
,,Famous Chicken Rice,5.0,,"Smaller hawker center here at Maxwell. But we beelined to Tian Tian Chicken Rice. Amazing how delicious a simple dish can be! Along side super cold tall Tiger bottles. Happy land. Go, eat, drink, enjoy."
,,I have been eating at this hawker centre for 20 years now.,5.0,,"The porridge stall famously known for its fish porridge, and their century-egg porridge.

The fried fitters from another stall is brilliant, which you will see long queue, from 11am onwards. When the owner is busy frying the food, you could also join in the fun and let you fried your own fitter!"
,,Must try in singapore,5.0,,"On my second trip we tried some of the hawker centres and this is great. It is in Chinatown and near the business centre but close to lots of hotels, the food is superb and very cheap, there are at least 100 places to eat with shared tables.the drinks are also cheap. You can try lots of different dishes and if some are not to your taste then leave them,remember to look for food hygiene classification, A is best. Followed by B etc and there are loads to choose from. This caters mainly for locals and is all the better for it, a hidden highlight that is well worth finding."
,,Some standout stalls,5.0,,"At here several times. My favourites were the Hokkien prawn noodles from Marina South Delicious Food - the sambal truly lifts the dish - and the coconut apom balik pancakes a little further down. Famous Tian Tian chicken rice was nice, but nowhere as wonderful as its reputation would lead you to expect."
,,Great Local Food,5.0,,"This was a great food experience. Lots of food to choose from, of course the most popular was the Chicken and Rice. The prices are super cheap, especially for Singapore standards. Chicken and rice will cost around 3.00 and a fresh juice 1.5-2.0. Most stalls have the food choices in english, otherwise the ol' point and order works just fine as well. Overall a great experience and would highly recommend if you want to try local food."
,,Good local Fare!,4.0,,"Variety and familiarity! Good value Teochew mixed vegetables, Hainanese chicken rice (many many stalls!), fish slice soups, Hongkong Char Siew & roasted meat, Singapore laksa, fish & meat congee, Tasty BBQ and wanton stalls plus peanut soup dessert and bean curd, not forgetting the mouth-watering onde onde!"
,,Definitely on the To Do List,4.0,,"Yes some say that this place is Touristic and that others are slightly cheaper but this place is a must to go and see and of course eat. It's an outside food court with every conceivable local dish to be found. Find a seat, order loads of fun dishes. New ones for me were Stingray and also Curried Fish Head. Cold beers, what else does one need. Make sure you allocate one evening for there."
,,Try the Porridge stall,4.0,,Tried the porridge stall today located in the middle column of the food centre. Can't remember the name of the stall but it has a red signage. The porridge was excellent for the price - had the pork and century egg one. Very clear and they are generous with the ingredients. Give it a try!
,,Local Food Delights,4.0,,"Good variety of food available.
Good to come after the lunch crowd from the offices in the vicinity.In the evening, there a are lot of stalls that serves good local food.
Great claypot rice/chicken rice and congee.
I like the idea of this hawker center in the cross junction of old Chinatown and in the middle of the modern skyscrapers in the vicinity."
,,Go to #71,5.0,,"Try the duck at # 71 Good Luck All the Way, Fu Shun is the man. There is always a line but just wait, they are awesome!!!"
,,Can be the best food center in Singapore,5.0,,Once you arrived during lunch hour ...you be lost !!! NO the place not big ..but you see long que everywhere ...and it's always packed during lunch hour ..not for the reason being it's a food senter in the CBD area ...but his center have got many wonderful stalls ...Must try ...
,,Good food court style dining in Chinatown,3.0,,"Food court and stall food is a very popular way to dine in Singapore and the Maxwell Food Court, which is situated on the edge of Chinatown is as good a place to try as any.

Here you can find mostly Chinese inspired foods with stall-keepers serving up dishes during most of the day, mostly locals dine here but we found a fair number of tourists trying the food on offer here as well.

During our recent visit we tried Stall 35 - Marina South Delicious Food for a serving of the local speciality called - Black Carrot Cake (SG$4) which is a typical Chinese dish served up here in Singapore. The turnip cake cubes were of smooth and nice texture, egg was fine and the flavour of the dish was pretty good (rating 3 of 5). Serving size was generous, making this a good budget friendly meal that tasted nice.

We have always enjoyed the food court scene in Singapore and include the Maxwell Food Court as one of many good options worth trying. Another nearby place worth trying is the Chinatown Complex which also offers a large second floor, open-air food court. Both are good options if you are interested in this local style of dining while spending time in Chinatown."
,,Must Visit whether You're on a Budget or not,4.0,,"When I first came to Singapore, Maxwell Center is the first hawker center I visited. It was night then and I was kinda astonished that most of the stalls are still open, catering perhaps the people who work late night. I picked this chicken meal and it came with unlimited pickled pepper as side dish. It tastes totally great for $3! As for the place, it's clean unlike other hawker centers I've been to where I need to put my feet on another chair because cockroaches are everywhere! Also, Maxwell Center is very accessible to where I stayed in Chinatown. It's near a bus station, if I'm not mistaken , so people can easily come there.

You guys should try it. It's basically the most famous one in SG."
,,Tons of foods,4.0,,My friend and I ate here almost everyday because it's very close to our hotel in Chinatown. There are a lot of foods and drinks. The quality was good and the price was okay.
,,Great Hawker Experience,4.0,,"If you want fine dining, go somewhere else.

If you want to experience a great Singaporean style hawker experience, it's a great place for a lunch or dinner.

Get a few Tiger beers and try a selection of dishes from different stalls.

Yes, it is hot, loud, a little dirty, you will be assaulted by a huge range of aromas and you may have to go MMA to get a table, but it is great value for money. You can have a small dinner and a beer for under $10, and the location is fantastic.

If you want something a little more upmarket after your hawker meal, walk up to the bars at Club Street. Or start with cocktails at Club street and having a late night stomach filler at Maxwell as the Singaporean alternative to a kebab.

A memorable Singaporean experience."
,,Forget it Mr Anthony Bourdain!,2.0,,"Went to the joint that Tony recommended, OK I guess if I had about 6 Large Tigers under my belt it would of been great, so would everything else for that matter. Nope it was a dud!! Left and had to have lunch elsewhere!"
,,Delicious local food with fair price,4.0,,You can find many local dishes here and the price is reasonable with large portion for each dish. Some shop you have to wait quite long (such as Tian Tian Chicken Rice) but after you try it you will realize that it's worth to wait for a long time.
,,Average and smelly!!,3.0,,Only place in Singapore where the smells were overwhelming. Food was cheap but quality was poor. I would recommend eating at a Chinatown restaurant.
,,Tian Tian Chicken rice,4.0,,"Long queue at Tian Tian Chicken rice but worth to wait! Soya bean curd opposite tian tian chicken rice is good, soft sweet"
,,Try a hawker center while in Singapore!!!,4.0,,"Easy to find, on the other side of Chinatown, and open daily until 10pm.
Mostly locals here, and with an impressive variety of foods‚Ä¶ Chicken rice, oyster omelet, stir-fried noodles, char kway teow, fried carrot cake, won ton noodles, guyoza, fish ball noodle soup, congee with pork, herbal tea, deep-fried banana...
I have found every stall to be good and not pricy, so try it!!!"
,,Local Singaporean Food Court - Try Tong Fong Fatt Chicken Rice,5.0,,"This is a very local singaporean food centre, also know as food courts or hawker centres. There are lots of local dishes like chicken rice, fried kway teow, fried carrot cake, won ton noodles... etc. Almost every stall is good, so just for anything that your stomach is calling out to. Food prices generally range around SGD$3-$5.

For those wanting to try chicken rice (a very local dish and a must have for visitors to Singapore), i recommend you to try the Tong Fong Fatt stall. I find their chicken more tender and the rice more fragrant and moist than the famous Tian Tian stall (which you can identify by the very long queue of people).

Try to avoid the peak period during 12-2pm as the lunch crowd would be flocking in from the nearby offices. If not, be prepared to wait for about 5-15 minutes to find a seat. And you would find packets of tissue papers ""littered"" over the tables and chairs, that usually means the table/seat is taken and they have gone to buy their food.

So be adventurous and try the different variety of food there!"
,,Maxwell Hainanese Chicken Rice - a notch better than Tian Tian !,5.0,,"Much was written on-line about the glorious Tian Tian Chicken rice stall at Maxwell Road Hawker Food Centre, notably the comment that ""if you see long queque of locals, the food must be very good"".

Though Tian Tian has been selling its chicken rice for many years (some say 20 yrs plus), I find subtle yet gradual changes in its offerings of one of Singapore's famous dishes. Firstly, the chicken rice has become rather tasteless and are from the long-grained variety (cooked rather dry). Secondly, the steamed chicken, though tender and delicious, are served bathed in a rather slimy sesame-oil flavoured sauce, a taste which locals like, but I find it disguises the taste of the chicken slices. I find the strong and heavy taste of sesame oil does not enhance the delicate taste of the tender chicken slices.

On the same level/path where Tian Tian is located, but on the opposite, and a few stalls further, is one stall called ""Maxwell Hainanese Chicken Rice"" - though it is about 4 years old - which serves its steamed chicken sslices without swimming in the slimy sesame oil, hence one really taste the smooth texture of the tender chicken pieces. The sauce here is a very light soya-based sauce. From this stall I ordered a dish of chicken drum-stick boneless meat, a dish of chicken liver, and a dish of towgay/bean sprouts. The chicken rice was served in a separate dish, plus a bowl of hot soup. I could taste the tender chicken slices which is more yummy when dipped in the light ginger, thick black soya, or chilly sauces. My order was outside the suggested menu and the cook was happy to oblige. i paid a total of SG 9.50 which is a far more worthy meal for two than if I ate elsewhere. I have no regrets not going back to Tian Tian where one has to stand in a line first to pay, get a receipt, then stand in another line to collect one's food order. To be fair, Maxwell Hainanese Chicken Rice has also its own line of fans.

Tips:
1) This Hawker Food Centre is very popular and extremely busy with office lunch time crowds - both for its yummy foods and its price-quality - hence not all stalls are open in the evenings. Suggest for tourists to go first for an afternoon tour of nearby Chinatown and then go around 6 p.m. for an early dinner. Do take note that after 8 p.m. the place will look nearly deserted and un-attractive. But if you plan to lunch there, be there by 12 noon, grab a table/seat, have a drink and you still have time to look at what the stalls are cooking before the office crowd turns the centre into a noisy, maddening, rush-hour ""train station"".

2) Be bold, instead of ordering what is suggested on the board posted with pictures of recommended menu and the set prices, ask the stall-keeper/cook what the price will be if you order certain favourites, like a dish of chicken liver only, or a dish of fried vegetables as side dishes to go with the chicken rice. Or ask for the rice to be served separate from the chicken breast slices you have specially ordered. But you can only do this outside the office rush hour."
,,Local Singaporean Food Court,4.0,,"Just cross the other side of China Town, easy access. Chicken rice, stire-fried noodles, fish ball noodle soup, congee, dessert, juicy, herbal tea, deep-fired banana.....except satay. It is closed around 9:00pm."
,,Lots of good food in one place,5.0,,"I could lunch here everyday. Fish soup (Cantonese style & teochew style), Hainanese curry rice, Thai food, $2 mee sua, bean curd pudding, chicken rice, sweet potato balls, sambal fried rice, katong laksa, soy bean milk with horlicks... and the list goes on. Good and cheap, and I'd visit Maxwell market anytime over Lau Pa Sat."
,,A great hawker centre in Chinatown,5.0,,"Our tour stopped near by and we popped in for a quick meal. Had the best curry puffs ever. Buzzy ,clean and more food than you can eat in a lifetime. We hope to go back and explore more thoroughly. Highly recommended."
,,Many choices in reasonable price,4.0,,"We came here to have lunch and breakfast...

We tried chicken rice, noodles, congees....There are many choices... and, the price was very reasonable. The chicken rice was just okay. But, I like the coffee very much. Not Starbuck style.

The fish congee was very good. You could find that out easily as there was a queue during breakfast time (even this was a weekday)."
,,Ready those chopsticks,4.0,,"Having left it until around 9pm to begin our gastronomic exploration of Chinatown we headed straight for this hawker market. By the looks of it we'd left it a bit late as several stalls were already closed or shutting up so the advice is to get there early for more choice. Hygiene ratings at each stall are typical of the Singaporean obsessiveness but nonetheless a comfort to western stomachs and tables are regularly cleared so there're no sitting amongst someone else's left-overs. Not that you'd have found many scraps at our table The random selection of food stall we made was a winner (with the exception of deep fried scallops which didn't taste homemade). The joy of this style of eatery is that it's great for sharing and sampling new dishes. Don't expect a la carte cuisine but for a genuine taste of one of Singapore's food cultures it's great and judging by the number of locals sitting around us lives up to its reputation as one of the best on the island.

Although you can walk to Maxwell Road from Boat Quay, it is a bit of a hike so the MRT is a good option and if you get off at Chinatown there's a chance to take in the Smith Street market en route."
,,Comfort food of all sorts,5.0,,"Endless food stalls to choose from, with all sorts of cuisine, mainly asian and if you need your own comfort food, definitely a stall that suits your need. Be alittle adventurous and order a dish from each stall, that is within your food intake limit, and savour the different flavours that this food centre can offer."
,,Wide variety of food but try and avoid rush hour,3.0,,"Great variety of street food. The major compliant i have is selfish people whom put their tissue pack to book the place and thus deprive those whom have already food in hand from seatings. This rude habit is peculiar to singapore and in other countries it s first come, first seated and you don t deprive others of seating when your own food is ready.

The 2nd bad mannerism is stranger barging it and sit without bothering to ask if seating is taken. The lack of civic mindedness as even clearing your own table for others after eating are the put off in eating at food courts. Put up with it if you want to eat at hawkers centres."
,,My Favorite Hawker Center !,4.0,,"I always go to this place few times a week to enjoy their food selection. They have a good bean curd , chicken rice ,western bbq, dumpling, porridge, fish soup and many more! the only thing I dislike is, it's so hard to find a place to sit at lunch time. Especially since a lot of tourist visited this place."
,,Loved by the locals,5.0,,"This food court at the end of Chinatown has a wide variety of food styles to suit all tastes. The prices are low, and - in common with other food courts/hawker centres - excellent food in basic surroundings."
,,The Quest for Chicken Rice,4.0,,"Maxwell Centre has a good number of food stalls to choose from. It is quite daunting to be there and not to have an initial idea of what to eat. Best thing to do is to walk around, see all stalls, inhale, look at what people order.

Toilets are clean :)"
,,Authentic food in the centre,5.0,,"The selection of food here is amazing - there are a lot of stalls with too many choices to choose from! We tried a number of stalls including duck, chicken rice and drinks - each was great and extremely cheap. Most dishes are $3-4SGD.

There are a few drinks places that press fresh sugar cane juice - perfect when your feeling tired from the heat!

Just make sure you don't rock up at peak times - like lunch time during business hours, as it will be hard to find a seat and there will be queues. We went about 11am or 3pm and had our choice of table with small queues at best."
,,wont eat anywhere better than here !,4.0,,We have been here every time we visit singapore and i have yet to find one single thing i didnt like .. We always try another few differant dishes and they never stop amazing us . 8 times to singapore .. and WE will be back again in march cant wait to visit there . to smell the great food and taste heaven !
,,My Favorite Hawker Center in Singapore,5.0,,"I loved Ah-Tai Chicken Rice stall. I can't remember the other stall names but I love the Duck Rice, Thai coconut drink, Red Ruby ice dessert, the pork rib soup/"
,,Mostly chinese foods,3.0,,"Likes: - Many seats and many stall, hence you always get some seat to eat - Most of the stall i tried tasted equally good. - I recommend the congee. Its really good Dislike: - mostly chinese foods"
,,Visit after 1:30pm to avoid the office lunch crowd,5.0,,"Maxwell food centre is the best example of a singapore hawker centre - the food square that you may find all popular must-try singapore dishes.

Located just a 10 minutes walk away from Chinatown MRT, you can spot the food centre from across the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple.

Popular dishes to try include Chicken Rice, local Singaporean desserts like Ice Kachang and Chendol. Go for the fried Banana Fritters as a snack on-the-go.

Do prepared that food is self-service and that there is no air-conditioning!"
,,Not the best,2.0,,"I am explorying a series of food court. This until now has been the most disappointing. It is located in the middle of Chinatown, which is convenient, but it begin to suffer the influx of tourist. Variety of offers is ok, but quality was very disappointing. I would describe this as a cheap fast food that is loosing the flavour of the originality of street food
If price is the key criteria of choice I found the Old Airport Road Food center a bit better"
,,as Anthony Bourdain says: eat at a Hawker Centre,4.0,,Anthony Bourdain says to to to a Hawker Centre and have the Singapore classic of rice and chicken. While plain it's tasty and I liked the crispy duck better. He ate sharks head but I passed on that. Great coffee stalls. Look for the rating card: B being better than A. Remember these are hawker stalls so
,,"Good hawker centre next to Chinatown, try",4.0,,"A good hawker centre, next to Chinatown and therefore easy to find! It is rather big, and pretty crowded, especially during the day when a lot of people working/living around come here to eat. The offer of food is good (though mainly Chinese) and for different tastes. Prices very low. I had an excellent fish soup, several kinds of grilled meat and fried fruits. The last was the best, really, really good. Looks pretty cleaner than some other hawker centres in Singapore."
,,Lunch at the Maxwell Road Hawker Centre,5.0,,"If you're visiting Singapore you need to give this place a go. Singapore street food experience: loads of choice, great tasting food and really really cheap!"
,,Large but half of the stalls were closed,4.0,,"Probably the largest hawker center we came across, with row after row of half closed stalls. The food is great and at good value, but nothing spectacular."
,,favourite place to eat in singapore,5.0,,"I stayed at a hotel just a few minutes walk from the centre and so I came there most days for lunch or dinner. The food choices are fantastic and quite diverse, and you are pretty much spoilt for choice. The chicken rice at Tian Tian is especially good but there are often long queues so get in early!"
,,Want to try good street food? Go Chinatown!,5.0,,"Many stalls with chineese and malaysian food. You can choose any option and won't be disappointed as all the food is great and the portions are huge. I personally recommend Pork ribs soup with cress salad or with old cucmber (very tasty and only 4 dollars per portion) and steamed duck. Be shure to choose stalls with ""A"" or ""B"" category (this places are clean and safe to eat)."
,,chicken rice,5.0,,must try the chicken rice.. really very good and not very expensive but the queue is very long. another must try is the beancurd which is different from the normal kind..
,,A little bit hard to find,5.0,,"Worth finding this is excellent food and lots to choose from, just behind the main area in Chinatown"
,,Luv the porridge and Yu tiao,4.0,,"Can't seem to have enough of it. The Zhen Zhen porridge with Yu Shen is just so addictive. Add on the Yu Tiao from the other shop and you have a complete meal. The portion is big enough for 2. Finally top off with the ovaltin soy milk (if it is open), and you have ablessed weekend morning meal."
,,Great Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.0,,"The hawker centre is like many others, good food, cheap prices. Look for the longest que and if you like the food being offered join the que. The Hainanese Chicken Rice is really, really good there. Bring wet wipes, as everywhere there won't be any napkins."
,,"Good Food, Just a little dirty",4.0,,"There is plenty of good food around in Maxwell Road Hawker Centre. The biggest downside is the location as it is quite a distance from the nearest train station. The thai food at the front corner of the complex is really good. It's the shop that I frequented. A little cleaner than the other hawker centre (Amoy Street), I dine at the premises every now and then. However, it is still not as clean as I would like it to be. Hence, most time, I would purchase my food and have it packed to go."
,,Re Open for business ??,4.0,,Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi May I know they are open for business already?? Renovation ended?? Miss the food there!!!!!
,,Good food,4.0,,"So many food to try here. Fish soup, mee siam, Wu xiang, fried fritters, hainan chicken rice, fried kwai teow, deserts etc.Many top rated local food. Don't miss this food centre!"
,,great one stop,4.0,,"Great place to try all the usual hawker favourites. Personally like: chicken rice, laksa, fried beehoon, western stalls, bean curd, Malay stalls and Indian stalls are excellent too."
,,High on my list,5.0,,"First, don't forget you are within walking distance of Mustafa center shopping, and the Buddah's Tooth temple. It was about a $25 taxi from the airport. We had been there, and had a 6 hour layover in the airport, and decided to do it again. We taxied down to where the traffic got thick, and hoofed it the rest of the way. My wife and I found different things to eat, I just had meat on a skewer, but there must have been at least a hundred stalls, each with dozens of choices, all at a price about what you would pay for fast food in the USA, and this stuff was AUTHENTIC, I got a little bit from several other places. Since I've been twice, I guess I can say, I eat there ""every time"" I'm in Singapore (which, admittedly, is not terribly often). It's not as clean as a Disney property, but I feel like it's sanitary."
,,Good and cheap food,4.0,,"Reasonable pricing for a wide variety of hawker good eats. Usually crowded so it's hard to find seats if you're in a large group. There's $2 fishball noodles, lao ban soya bean curd, prawn mee, and so much more to choose from. Good variety to share. Be prepared to sweat while eating hot food since there's no air-con. Good Singaporean hawker food experience."
,,Yummy,5.0,,"The range of food here, and the ridiculously low prices make it a great place to eat. There were lots of business people mingling with the locals and tourists and we had no worries about the safety of the food. It was lovely."
,,A must do if you happen to visit Sri Mariamman Temple in Chinatown,5.0,,"If you are visiting the Sri Mariamman Temple in Chinatown, do skip across the road to the Maxwell Road Hawker Centre.

It is a great location to explore GOOD local food at untouristy price under one roof.

I should know...as a local I eat there myself......

I have a soft spot for the fish porridge and the raw fish (Chinese style) ......with the dough fritter.

My idea of a power breakfast !

Yummy."
,,Maxwell Road,4.0,,It is one of the few remaining traditional Hawker Centre at a reasonable price. There is the variety you expect and always a seat. If anything perhaps a little bit out of the tradiional tourist route (but not that far). I recommend it and has been a favourite of mine for years
,,Maybe I'm just American--but...,3.0,,"The place seemed fine, I just can't get myself past the origins of the meat. The draft beer was pis$, but quickly replaced with a can of Tiger. Go with and open mind and a strong stomach. Much better than Newton Circus and much less harassment."
,,Nice hawker center,4.0,,"You can find any kind of local Singapore delicacies here. Trust me, it won't disappoint you; especially if you are new to Singapore and surrounding. This place can be a bit hot though and beware of long lines during lunch time."
,,Where locals eat,3.0,,"If you want to visit an authentic hawkers centre and this is the place. Food is very cheap, place is undercover but still gets hot in the humid Singapore weather."
,,"Great Food, especially Chicken Rice",4.0,,"Recommend Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice. The chicken is so soft, tender and juicy. Although every customer need to queue up for order, it's worth to spend time to wait."
,,Plenty to choose from,5.0,,Great Hawker Centre lots of good food from everywhere...Had great cuttle fish as well as fried oysters at different outlets
,,Endless Choice - Excellent VfM,4.0,,Ate here with the family on our two night Singapore stopover on the way to Oz. Loads of different foods to try. Not haute-cuisine by any stretch but good tasty food. Excellent value for money too. Great atmossphere if you're a people watcher.
,,Closed without notice until Dec 2012,2.0,,Tried to visit this hawker building for its famous chicken rice but it was closed without notice on the website or tourist info :( Very disappointing! The tourist info websites need to have better updated information!
,,Amazing Variety - Great Chicken Rice,5.0,,"Amazing selection of authentic delicious foods like chicken rice and fish porridge. This hawker center was featured in Anthony Bourdain's show ""No Reservations."" The Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice stall has extraordinarily delicious yet inexpensive chicken rice. Go There!!!"
,,Can't wait for renovations to be done!,4.0,,"Great variety of local and some eg thai regional food. Great value. Good Teochew porridge, Cantonese porridge. Hainanese curry rice. Best hand made squid balls in Singapore !"
,,No-Frills Asian Dishes,4.0,,"Maxwell hawker centre has none of the fanfare that surrounds the more famous Newton hawker centre, but it offers a slice of the wonderful Asian dishes. It is located opposite the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple in Chinatown and is a short 5 mins walk from Tanjong Pagar MRT station.

Must try is the famous caurry rice, which is basically a simple no-frills dishes served with rice and a non-spicy, thick curry.

Another must try is the sasame balls."
,,lots of choices of singapore local food !,4.0,,"you can find all sorts of nice food here, well i tried the laksa, spicy ! But it was great, order a sugarcane drink, total cost not over five dollars, got desserts too !"
,,Fill your tummy with yummies with just $10,5.0,,"If you only have time for one foodcentre/hawker centre to satisfy your craving for true-blue Singapore food, this is the place. I usually patronise this hawker between 11-5pm on weekdays because that's when you will have most of the stalls operating. look out for those stores that sells only one or less than 3 different style of dishes. It's a sign of ""these-peope-know-what-they-are-doing"". here's a proposed menu for $10:
a cup of ice lime juice,
one plate of <<tien tien>> chicken rice,
one <Hup Kee Wu Xiang Guan Chang>ngoh hiang (fried meat roll in bancurd skin),
a bowl of <<Jin Hua Fish Head Bee Hoon ÈáëÂçéÈ±ºÂ§¥Á±≥Á≤â>> fish meat soup with milk,
one bowl of <<Lao Ban Soya Beancurd ËÄÅ‰º¥Ë±ÜËä±>> bean curd.

That would be enough food for two person unless you are a glutton like me. That's what I call fine dining, experiencing the finest Singapore food in its best!"
,,The real thin,4.0,,"This place is hot and crowded and that's part of the charm. Great food, hot, spicy (or at least the hotpot we ordered was) and tastes great. Sit outside and soak up the atmosphere. I agree with the other poster, much better than Lau Pa Sat."
,,Not what I expected,2.0,,"I wish we could do a good report on Maxwell Road Hawker Centre as we had spent some time walking there and passed up eating at Food Street in China Town .The Trip Advisor reports made the place look so good.We had eaten on previous trips to Singapore at other Hawker Markets and found them great.It may have been an off night .The place was dull,dirty and over half the outlets closed.Nothing at any of the stalls made us want to stay.We ate at a Chinese Restaurant back in China Town,clean,Air Con and nice food."
,,A great local hawker center,5.0,,"The place is now under renovation

A great alternative to the more tourist friendly Lau Pa Sat:

A central yet accessible truly popular place of Singapore where you can get cheap yet delicious local food.

A lot of stall are waiting for you here. I love strolling around for exotic food. No way you can pick wrong. Some stalls here are really famous and you can see queues forming as early as 11h50 for lunch.

The little beer garden at the entrance provides the cheapest tiger beer of Singapore - to be shared with the old chinese of the 'hood

A unique experience!!!"
,,Food haven,5.0,,Large & diverse variety of south east asian food at affordable prices. Located just across Buddha Tooth Relic Temple & Chinatown.
,,Food Heaven,3.0,,"Just name it...any kind of local food.This is heaven for food lovers.Be it vegetrian or non-vege.Best soya bean and sugarcane also can be found here.Local pastries like tapioca coated with coconut, ode-ode is very famous and people queue very early just to buy this."
,,Singapore Food Culture,4.0,,Try the yummy chicken rice if you want a taste of Singapore culture. There are a few stalls around; just go for the one with the longest queue!
,,Excellent Food - great for good value lunch in China Town,4.0,,This quite a small Hawker Centre which I liked as sometimes the choice can be overwhelming. I ate there at lunchtime with friends from two different vendors. Both sets of meals were high quality. I can especially recommend the Thai pineapple rice which was delicious. Note Maxwell is closed until end of November for refurbishment. It is situated across the main road from the front of Buddha Tooth Temple.
,,Tian Tian a must-visit,5.0,,Tian tian chicken rice is simply the best chicken rice in Singapore! a must try! Be ready to queue for at least 20 minutes around lunch time!
,,Good value but closed in Oct/Noc 2012,4.0,,"Currently being renovated, but worth a look once re-opened. Generally good meals for very modest prices. Drinks are usually ordered separately via roving sellers."
,,Excellent hawker centre if you like Hainanese chicken rice,5.0,,Went to Ah-Tai twice recently. Perhaps the best in Singapore for just a few dollars. There are other stalls there which are also highly rated.
,,"Great food, great choice, great experience.",5.0,,"What a great place to visit for food! Foodies or occasional foodies will love it, but even if you don't consider yourself one, this place is worth a visit for some great food and just the experience of it. Singapore has a lot of great hawker centers and many are worth a visit if you have time. Some Singaporeans have strong opinions about which ones are the best, but if you are visiting for a short period and can only try one, you could do worse than visit this one.

As for the food options, The Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice is probably the most famous and with good reason. But don't dismiss the relatively new stall nearby, the Ah Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice. Opened by Tian Tian's chef of 20 years after he had a falling out with his employers.

I also had a chance to try a few other stalls and can recommend Fuzhow Oyster Cake (Stall 22), Char Kway Teow (Stall 35), but there are so much more options.

One warning though, I went in September 2012 and there were signs that said the place was going to be closed for a month for renovations sometime starting October."
,,Fun and tasty,5.0,,"Positives: amazing choice of interesting dishes, very tasty, fun and friendly atmosphere, happy people, good prices Negatives: not posh (obviously)"
,,Best experience for me in Singapore,5.0,,The food was excellent (Had Hainese curry rice and chicken) and it was clean. Huge selection was making it almost difficult. Best experience I had in whole Singapore!
,,Must-visit hawker center!!!,5.0,,"We come here for Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice (stall #10) for the much sought-after chicken rice with no less than Anthony Bourdain raving about it. If you're not lucky enough to get their last serving (why, they run out of stock as early as 7:30pm!), don't worry, 2 stalls away from Tian Tian is Ah-Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice which serves an equally-yummy Hainanese Chicken Rice!

Who can go wrong with a meal at SGD 3.00?"
,,Good Foodcourt but by far not the best,3.0,,"It's a good foodcourt, no doubt. You will find authentic, cheap and very succulent stuff there! However I think it goes too far to consider it the best one in Singapore, it just isnt."
,,Yummy!,5.0,,"Another great food centre to go. Tien Tien Chicken Rice, the fish soap, chinese spring roll, Rojak ... ... Good food to eat with reasonable price."
,,Comfort food goes Gourmet,5.0,,"From oyster cakes that sport plump oysters and prawns in every bite to the legendary Tian Tian Chicken Rice, this hawker centre has it all. Banana fritters are worth a try. Don't miss the Aloe Vera juice at the stall opposite Tian Tian. I visit Maxwell at least once a week and it is one of my favourite hawker centers."
,,Huge variety,5.0,,"Huge variety of food here, there are so many stalls and the prices are fairly decent for hawker food. Yum!"
,,Food Experience,5.0,,"After seeing and hearing so much about this place, and was great to finally make it there. The food is fantastic. Be sure to get the Chicken Rice from Tian Tian."
,,value four money,5.0,,"this area is excellent, freshly cooked food,plenty to choose from,hundreds of menus,and after paying out plenty of serious cash in nice restaraunts, this is dead cheap,eg: two good size portions for two people, ¬£6!!!"
,,Good and Yummy !,4.0,,"The Maxwell Road Hawker Centre just next to China town. Good variety of foods to select and taste good and not expensive at all. Not easy to get a sit during lunch hour. Chicken rice is good with resonable price at S$3.5.
Cos this center is a bit 'old', therefore, it will be closed for a few months undergo renovation work from end of Septermber."
,,Nice foods,5.0,,The foods are not so expensive and taste good to eat. Popular with office staff and people living near by.
,,Best Chinese hawker food in Singapore,5.0,,"Easily the best Chinese hawker food in Singapore, in one location. The eating areas themselves are not particularly great, and it tends to be very crowded at lunchhours and dinner, but you can't really go wrong with the the food. Just watch where the locals join the longest queues and you'll be in for a treat. I especially like the Hainanese Curry Rice stall, but Chicken Rice and Teochew Porridge stalls are excellent, to name a few. Oh yeah, it's very affordable food. Well worth a stop through when in Chinatown area (and superior to the Chinatown Hawker center in my opinion)."
,,Lots of food at reasonable price,4.0,,"I stay at Berjaya Hotel which is 5 minutes walking distance to this food court. I have had my breakfast for the 3 days I was in Singapore. The food court was divided into 3 rows. Try to avoid the middle row as the air flow is quit bad, hot and sometimes smelly."
,,Cheap and Good,4.0,,"If you are in Chinatwon, just drop at Maxwell Road Hawker Centre. Just opposite Buddha Tooth Temple. Lots of good and cheap food."
,,Authentic atmosphere and food,5.0,,"We had lunch at the Maxwell Road Hawker Centre during our trip after reading about it on the forum here. It's definately worth it, the food was great and very cheap. Plenty to choose from you'd be hard pressed not finding something to suit your tastes. We went at lunch time so it was very busy, just a tip don't be shy about sitting at a table with spare seats we just asked politely if the seats were taken and were very happily welcomed to share a table.
Lunch cost us $10 + a beer and soft drink $7 (SIN). Very clean establishment, we would most definately recommend it.
Maxwell Road Hawker Centre is situated across from the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, very easy to find."
,,The real deal,5.0,,"Please make time to go to the Maxwell Road Hawker Centre and be a little adventurous about your food choices. This is what people are talking about when they say street food in Singapore is great. You'll see lots of locals having their lunch and dinner here, in the heart of Chinatown. Just get in there and try something you've never had before. Take recommendations. Have fun."
,,good and inexpensive - try not to come during lunch hour,4.0,,I come here mainly for the Tian Tian chicken rice. However the queue is really long so we recommend you avoid the lunch hour
,,Market stall food you should experiene,4.0,,"On the edge of China town and in my opinion a great way to sample local flavours. Even more convincing is that the locals also eat here, so it must be good.

There is so much variety so take a wonder and pick what takes your fancy and don't forget to leave some room for a dessert too."
,,"You name it, it's there!",4.0,,"Asian food overload! Whatever you wanted, it's there. 3 extensive rows of stalls with all sorts of Asian food. some of which you would not find in a Western country. Lots of seating. We indulged in pork, duck & noodle dishes washed down with mixtures of fresh fruit juices with loads of ice. A real Asian experience not to miss."
,,Lots of good food,4.0,,"This hawker centre is one of the older hawker centre in Singapore and there are lots of good local food that can be found her.

1) Tian Tian Chicken Rice (smooth and soft chicken)
2) Tapioca kueh (usually sold out by 1pm)
3) Fish soup (look for the queue at lunch and you will know which store)
4) Fried oyster pancake (unhealthy but very yummy)"
,,Not the best but cheap,3.0,,Average to good noodles and Chicken Rice etc next to Chinatown and cheap by Singapore standards. I would rather go to the Food Opera at the Ion Centre for better choice in a better environment.
,,Gotta go chicken rice lah!,5.0,,"You come to the Maxwell Market for the Tian Tian Hainan chicken rice, and it's really fantastic. But the fruit stand is also well worth a visit, and the kopi's good too. Of course it's not airconditioned, it's a hawker market!

Consider a trip across the road to the Singapore City Gallery if you're into urbanism: fascinating exhibits on the history of Singapore's urbanisation."
,,Excellent place!,5.0,,"Great all round food and cheap, we spent alot of time here trying all types of food,the roti prata & curry is a great dish (1st shop 1st row on left hand side, )
Chicken rice is good! But all dishes we tried were great depending what you like. We never tried the frog dishes or the live frog dishes:)
Overall excellent 10/10"
,,Delicious local food,4.0,,"I have been to Maxwell's twice now, before going keep a few things in mind. This is an outdoor hawker center, your table won't always be clean, you will sometimes share your table with others, and it can get pretty hot (no breeze or a/c). Get ready for an inexpensive local authentic experience.

I have tried a number of the stalls but will comment on two, Tian Tian chicken rice is the best hawker chicken rice I have tried so far. The chicken is better then Boon Tong Kee, but the rice at Boon Tong Kee beats Tian Tian (however Tian Tian is half the price). I have also tried the stall just to the left of Tian Tian. Rumor has it that this was started by the chef of Tian Tian and is actually better. I tried it and it is not, Tian Tian has better chicken rice in every regard.

One other tip, if there are dishes on the table you want to sit at and you want them cleared, you need to be pretty aggressive with the table clearing staff... they tend to do their own thing and just wander..."
,,Terrific array of flavors all in one location!,5.0,,"Fantastic variety and great tasting cuisine! If you are short on time and want to taste what Singapore has to offer, it's a must visit."
,,Try the Tian Tian Chicken,4.0,,"Though I loved the broth, I thought the Chicken Rice was average. The place at the end of that row on the left hand side is much better overall. Nevertheless, Maxwell is fun and tons of locals go there. It's more authentic than Newton and less expensive too."
,,delicious!,4.0,,one of my fav hawker centers - the food is authentic and good and the hawker atmosphere it excellent!
,,Authentic Singapore,5.0,,"Maxwell hawker centre still retains the feel I remember from 25 years ago. Tian Tian chicken rice is fantastic..... And other stalls are good, too. Hot? Yes! Crowded? Yes! Scruffy? Yes! ....... But a great place to eat."
,,Not the best in Singapore,3.0,,"I am a true blue Singaporean, born and bred here. I only go to Maxwell for the Tian Tian chicken rice, which I think is among the best in Singapore, though I know of a few other stalls elsewhere which are equally good.

In fact, Maxwell is not my favourite place because it is so hot. I highly recommend Tiong Bahru Market food center, near Tiong Bahru MRT station, which is well ventilated, and is truly local."
,,Lunch with the locals,4.0,,"This is very much a locals place so don't expect anything fancy, but it does give you a real insight in to how the local Singaporeans eat. Our kids loved it as it is such a vibrant place full of different dishes being cooked, chatter and smells. The food we had was all decent and at a very cheap price, by Singaporean standards."
,,An asian cornucopia of delicious food for the budget concious or adventurous.,4.0,,"An abundance of asian dishes can be had in this large, semi-open-air conglomeration of little food shops/ restaurants. Asian staples like fish balls and pork soup can be found in triplicate, and rice porridge is always good. There are some sweet shops, and you can get a cold beer...prices are reasonable by any standard, and downright cheap by Singapore standards! Be prepared to share a table. And if you have a chance to buy a little packed on napkins, do so. Even if I tell you to bring some, you will forget, so buy some there from one of the little vendors who walk around selling them for $1-2 sgd a packet. A great place to bring the family, or to grab a quick snack in-between attractions, or just to go chill out with a good, inexpensive meal and a beer, for less than $10sgd."
,,lunch,3.0,,Too warm a place. Prefer aircon. Too congested. Prefer more roomy. Food fares are OK. Foods are tasty. Prefer more decorative.
,,"Where the locals eat, which means it's GOOD!",4.0,,"This place is fantastic! Amazing food at dirt cheap prices (for Singapore!) a few SGD will get you a very good meal (or even two) and a drink.

The setting is not meant to be fancy, it is a local food court for local Singaporeans, and does simply what it says on the tin, nothing more, nothing less.

There are three 'rows' of stalls, each row having a number of plastic tables for you to eat at. You simply walk round the stalls, see what takes your fancy, order it then sit down and eat. It often gets full quickly, so 'reserve' a space on a table while you get your food with a packet of tissues if you are on your own. The trick to eating here if you are a little new to the food court experience or overwhelmed by the choice, is to see which stall has the biggest queue, then go and join it!"
,,Great Food,4.0,,It is so easy to get food quickly. All of the food is good and it's very cheap. But it's very hot and not the greatest ambiance.
,,"Great food, cheap, cheap prices!",5.0,,I was recommended to come here by a Singapore expat in Australia - what a great recommendation! The food was very cheap - S$4 will get you quite full! We lined up for half an hour for Tian Tian hianese chicken rice because it was recommended - and it did not disappoint - it was well worth the wait! Nice chicken rice I have ever had! I also recommend the soy bean curd dessert - soft and silky and not too sweet!
,,Fantastic,4.0,,"We really enjoyed eating at this Hawker Centre. I suggest you avoid going between 12-2pm as it gets very busy. Food is good and very cheap and people are lovely! As you share tables you get to eat with the locals and they are very friendly. We met a lovely couple that not only recommended the best eats on the market but also let us try their food. It is not a restaurant so if you don't mind a bit of noise, dirt and crowd go there to try some tasty local specialties."
,,One of the best places for chicken rice at reasonable price,4.0,,Tin Tin is the well known chicken rice place located inside the Maxwell Food Center. One can find the long queue in front of the store almost at all time. The price is reasonable. The only regret is they only serve chill ginger and not ginger alone.
,,"Good food, excellent value",4.0,,"Relatively local hawker center near Chinatown. Here is what I tried and have no complaints:
Banana leaf char kway teow ($3/4/5) at stall #35.
Lime drink ($2) at juice stall next to #35.
Hainanese Chicken Rice ($5) at stall #10 (Anthony Bourdain recommendation)

Everything was good. Expect to sit with other locals at the large communal tables. I liked this better than the larger Lau Pa Sat hawker center over in the financial district."
,,Fairly good food and super cheap,3.0,,"Went to Maxwell Road this week after reading the reviews and wow, what an experience for a new arrival ! Very basic feel, but looking around the place and me being the only white face what kinda cool. I ordered a kind of porridge with donuts which one of the locals recommended and it was good. Great experience."
,,Excellent hawker food,4.0,,Some of the best crispy duck we have ever had - and literally so cheap. Great atmosphere - we were virtually the only tourists in the place.
,,Fantastic Food,5.0,,"If you are a foodies, you need to try the food stalls. Favourite ones are the fruit places which sell fresh fruit. What you see is what you get, no fancy packaging or airs or graces, but this is what makes MAxwell Food Court so wonderful."
,,Good Variety,4.0,,"Good variety of hawker stalls. Excellent Asian food at really good prices. Beer reasonably priced also. If arriving late in the evening, service is pretty much DIY for food and beer. Not an issue. Well worth a visit."
,,Real Sing Cultural Expreience,4.0,,"This is a no miss experience in Singapore. Don't be afraid to try new things. It's not a slick or polished restaurant but you can count on the Health Dept. Grades that are prominently displayed in each booth. Try the ""Carrot cake"" (it's not what you think, but is yummy)."
,,Try the carrot cake,4.0,,"Too many good choices to choose from at Maxwell's.

There is a hawker stand in the center of the Maxwell Centre that sells the most delicous carrot cake!! The owner is a friendly man from Malaysia. Across the way, there is also a good dessert shop that makes a refreshing shave ice.

Tip: bring your own napkins!"
,,Cheap food,4.0,,"$10 will feed a family of 4, Doesn't look very hygienic but all stores have hygiene grades(?) posted on their wall. We tried chicken rice, fishball noodle soup, ice kachang, congee and durain tofu. Chicken rice was not as good as I had expected but everything else was pretty good. You don't need to try to eat here as there are tons of restaurants in Chinatown but if you're walking around and happened to pass by, you might want to just stop by."
,,Best Hot and Sour Soup,4.0,,Check out the Shanghai stall for dumplings and soup. Yum!
,,Great Value does not do it Justice,5.0,,"Great simple food everyone can enjoy. It's delicious, varied, simple and cheap. I have had 10x the price for 1/2 the quality. Love it!"
,,Taste and Value is hard to beat!,4.0,,"After a few years absence we returned to Maxwell Road for dinner. It was a stark contrast to the Conrad, were we we staying, but great flavors and a glimpse of the local scene. Chicken rice, soup and beverages for two for $S13!! Our only disappointment was that Tian Tian, suggested by many on Tripadvisor, closed at 1900 after selling out. No worries, there are many options."
,,For lunch,4.0,,"There is a lot of hawker stall with great food, especially the hainanese chicken rice, the Singaporeans are famous for their sugarcane with lemon juice drink, a quick thirst for a sunny day. Rojas was also not bad, tau foo fan was also nice as well, smooth and silky, prices for very cheap. A very good place to really get to know a real Singaporean food."
,,This place is me!,5.0,,"Really lovely, varied Hawker food at rock bottom (for Sing) prices. No need to go into details, just visit it if you go to Singapore. Wish the Brits could do the same."
,,"Good Food, Cheap With Many Variety",3.0,,"There's many food stalls provide delicious food with $2-$5 range. But it is too crowded and hot. Except to try the popular Tian Tian Chicken rice, I prefer to go to other place such as Lavender Food Square."
,,"Diverse, honest, down-to-earth experience (along with food!)",3.0,,We visited the Maxwell Road Hawker Centre on our first day after travelling to Singapore. It was Saturday lunchtime and we arrived after an interesting walk through the culture and history of Chinatown. It was also a welcome escape from the rain shower that was...More
,,Great Food Great Value,5.0,,We vistsed this place because we were told we had to experience Hainnen Chicken Rice. We went one night and did that and then went back the next night to experience a heap of other dishes. Its really good value - prices range from $3...More
,,AUTHENTIC GOOD FOOD,4.0,,"There are so many stalls selling good and delicious food such as the chicken rice stalls, the porridge, etc. But you must be prepared to queue for about half an hour if you want to eat chicken rice during lunch time."
,,Must-visit place for foodies,4.0,,"Some of the best food in Singapore, so many great options for little money - fantastic! The selection for vegetarians is very limited though."
,,"Chicken rice, dim sum, prawn noodle, teochew muey,...they have it all",4.0,,"Chicken rice is great and very competitive, almost every competitor is good."
,,Nice food with competitive pricing,4.0,,"I was there one evening. the surrounding has 2 museums, red dot museum and architecture museum. From its north gate, one could see th high rise chinatown. and the hawker area has very distinct flavors... i really enjoyed huge glasses of sugarcane juice, and also...More"
,,Love the Food!,4.0,,"Of all the popular Hawker Centers in Singapore, we decided to go to the one at Maxwell Road based on positive reviews here on tripadvisor. It was a yummy (and cost-efficient) break from hotel, cafe and restaurant food for us! We tried Tian Tian's famous...More"
,,Awesome!,4.0,,"Eat till you burst! Then eat some more! At these prices, you'd be a fool not too. A great range of fantastic Singaporean food. The Hainese Chicken rice is a popular dish and can sell out from some stalls. The fried oyster cakes were yum....More"
,,Authentic food experience,4.0,,"We loved it! The Hawker Centre was very close to our hotel, quite full with guests and smelled fantastically of good food. We decided to join the queue at Tian Tian (chicken for my boyfriend, veggies for me), and we were not disappointed. The orange sauce looked toxic and was very very spicy, so get your beers ready before you try it."
,,Delicious and affordable,5.0,,Loved the Hainanese chicken rice by Tian Tian stall and Char kway cheow. I like also that some stalls are open even at midnight. 1-minute walk if you are staying at Matchbox the Concept hostel.
,,"Affordable, wide variety",5.0,,"This is a big food centre with rows of hawkers selling Singaporean fare, at pretty affordable prices, each one competing with the other.

There are a few more popular or famous stalls which will usually have long queues of customers. Though it sounds silly, queues are actually quite a reliable indicator of how good the food is, eg. Lao Ban Soya Ben and Tian Tian Chicken Rice. Some other more unusual hawkers include the uncle selling the Horlicks+Soya Milk drink. Give it a try!

It tends to be crowded on weekdays at lunchtime because of the working crowd."
,,Cheap and tasty,3.0,,We went here to try the Tian Tian chicken rice but it was closing so they recommended a stall a couple of booths along which was okay and really cheap. The whole centre is huge and has a wide variety of foods! We walked from Swissotel Merchant Court and it was and easy walk through Chinatown.
,,Great Variety,4.0,,"Wed went on a Sunday, so a number of stalls were shut down. But there was still a fantastic variety of good, cheap food. My big plate of stir-fried bee hoon noodles came with a fried egg, a slab of fried fish, stir-fried cabbage and carrots and set me back only about $US2.20. Even my small Tiger beer was a reasonable deal by Singapore standards at $US2.75. Conveniently located across South Bridge Rd. from the new Buddha Tooth Temple."
,,Pretty Good and Inexpensive,4.0,,"Good food for not a lot of money and many choices. I had pad thai, which was delicious. My companion ate mee hoon with a fried egg and some fish, that was ridiculously inexpensive and tasty."
,,Great Place to have local food,5.0,,For tourist this is a MUST go.. cos this is where the locals go for our daily meals during lunch and dinner. There are a lot of stalls... with some very famous ones and many are there for a few generations. Explore. The prices are cheap and you will NOT be charged tourist prices (like in Newton)
,,Chicken Rice!,5.0,,"This is the place to go for chicken rice, laksa, a bit of satay, a fresh juiec, some noodles...pretty much anything you want and for a low cost. This is where to go if you want to taste real singaporean food and feel at one with the locals and embed yourself in some culture.

I had the best chicken rice of my life here as well as an avacado shake and spent S$7! which in British pounds equates to something very, very cheap. But also was one of the best food experiences I have ever had.

I want to stay longer in Singapore next time for the pleasure of eating my way around this centre a little more.

I suggest you arrive at a decent time and be prepared to loosen your belt so you can enjoy the market in its entirety!"
,,GREAT FOOD IN SINGAPORE AND NOT TO BE MISSED,5.0,,"The Maxwell Rd hawker centre is must when visiting Little China in Singapore. There are rows of great little restaurants with very cheap and affordable delicacies, fruit juices and mains. Most are open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Chicken rice is a favourite. Average prices are around 5-6 Singapore dollars, a far cry from the high prices in restaurants and hotels. The kids will love the bustling atmosphere as locals and tourist alike flock to the place.
If you can't find something great to eat here, you're too fussy. Bon appetite!"
,,Good Eats,5.0,,Anthony Boudain frequents this place so you will see alot of his food selections. he gives them certificates. The Hainanese Chicken Rice is good and so is the Fish Ball soup. For a snack I suggest the sweet Tofu desserts
,,try the dumplings,5.0,,This place has the best chicken rice and sweet potato dumplings in town! Try the coconut filled sweet potato dumplings. they are incredible.
,,chicken hainaneese,3.0,,tian tian chicken hainaneese rice is the stall to look for!
,,"Mate !! take your time, plenty of choices",5.0,,"Easy to get to across from China town, wonderful drinks and amazing food choices, cheap excellent and fresh ! enjoy !"
,,Chose the stalls with queues and you can't go wrong,4.0,,"We wandered about the stalls deciding what to order, noticing there were long queues at several of the stalls. One was a fish head soup stall which didn't appeal to either of us. The other was a hainanese chicken rice stall (Tian Tian) for which Singapore hawker stalls are famous for so it wasn't a hard choice. While DH joined the queue, I went in search of drinks. I bought a tiger beer for him and the stall keeper wanted to know where we were sitting. As there were no tables near the stall where he was queued, the stall keeper simply asked a Singaporean man if we could share his table. We had a nice chat to him over our meal and he said we made a good choice ordering from the stall we did. The chicken was tasty and so very tender and the rice very fragrant. While DH drank his beer, I bought a young coconut drink; the top of the coconut simply cut off and a straw and spoon stuck in. I found the juice interesting but a little thin in taste. I tried eating some of the soft coconut meat but it didn't really appeal. After the meal, we bought some cut fruit from another stall - red papaya, pineapple and mango all which were delicious."
,,Awesome,5.0,,You must try the congee from zhen zhen and the hainese chicken from tian tian.
,,So many choices!,4.0,,"Good food, tons of choices, cheap!! We ate here multiple times during our trip to Singapore. I enjoyed everything I ate, in spite of the heat!!"
,,kinda hot but the best of singapore is here,4.0,,"i was in a youtube review looking 4 the best chicken rice in singapore. they say to look for the long queue in front of tian tian stall.. when i got there tian tian was close and the long line is on another stall selling chicken rice, about 3 stall next to tian tian. the queue was for 15 min. but is one of the best chicken rice yet. later i found out that tian tian cooks was the one open the new stall. 3.5 $ for the best taste in singapore.. i think the new stall is call hian ti chicken rice u wont miss the long gueue..

ps : just learn this from the local if ur alone, buy a small tissue and put it on the empty chair to ""reserve"" or ""dips"" the chair for u. save u alot of time searching for chair with the long queue and all.."
,,My favorite hawker center,4.0,,"By far a local favorite, maxwell has some of the best hawker stalls Singapore has to offer.
Many of the shops close early, or never open at all, and you have to know which stalls to go to (the ones with the longest cues...)
But it's much better than tourists traps like Lao pa sat or newton.
Also has the best juice shop."
,,A typical Chinese hawker centre with variety of authentic Singaporean dishes,4.0,,"Actually this place is a typical Chinese Hawker Centre that serves Chinese Zhi Char food (ÁÖÆÁÇí), which literally means 'cook & fry', in reference to the de rigueur use of frying in preparing most dishes. Located in the heart of Chinatown, Maxwell Road Hawker Centre has over 100 stalls, providing one of the biggest varieties of local food in Singapore. Having a meal at a food centre here you will get an authentically Singaporean dining experience. The stalls‚Äô offerings are very varied. Some must-try items here include the famous Tian Tian Chicken Rice, the traditional congee with pork and century egg and the popular Char Kway Teow."
,,Just an ordinary hawker center with lots of nice foods,3.0,,"This market is full of Chinese Foods and other Asian foods.
I used to come here with my friends after our table tennis session in the morning. So, we will always have lunch together after the game.

We used to queue up for the delicious bean curd here which is the branch from the old airport road call Lao Ban Soya. if you haven't taste it, you should come here and try and be ready to queue."
,,Not one of the best,2.0,,Hawker stalls can be fun but this one is a bit grubby and the food underwhelming
,,Bit overrated,3.0,,"I am generally fond of eating in the hawker/food centres in Singapore as the food is good and the cheapest you will get in the city. Maxwell House was always rated as one of the best but I came away quite disappointed with my last visit. It was on a Sunday and a lot of the stalls were closed, which might account for my average experience. But I'll try it again to see if it improves."
,,Value and packed with delicious foods!,5.0,,"Simply put... It's quick, cheap, clean and there are lots of delicious options! $2.50 for a chicken, veggies and rice combo to die for!"
,,nothing to rave about,3.0,,joined the long queu for the chicken rice. Wish there was no red in the chicken
,,Chicken Rice Paradise,5.0,,"Everyone knows Tian Tian for chicken rice and nearby rival Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice, but keep in mind that this is the food court in Chinatown, so while a chicken rice is obligatory, wander around and join the longest line for a surprise. There are many other worthy stalls to consider, just follow your nose and the lines!

Regarding the chicken rice- everyone has their favorite and personally, I liked both Tian Tian and Ah Tai. At the prices they charge, you can afford to try both. The only trick is to not overdue it and ruin your appetite."
,,Street Food in Singapore,5.0,,"Street food throughout Asia is one of those fanastic experiences that draws me to go back whenever I can. I could talk about the 11 countries and 26 cities I've visited, but instead focus on my personal favorite - Maxwell Road Hawker Centre. The challenge of street food anywhere in the world is the hygiene. While it may taste great, you don't want to suffer illness later that night or next morning. Unfortunately, an experience I have had on a few occassions.

Singapore has addressed this problem in a structured and organized manner that is typical for this city / nation. Hawker stalls are a government controlled activity that provides adequate control to ensure health and safety, but at the same time allows for both the quality and price one would expect from street food.

There are Hawker facilities throughout Singapore, but I've become attached to this particular one both because of the quality / variety of food and its excellent location. It is located directly across the street from the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple on the edge of Chinatown. It is also a few blocks away from Thian Hock Keng Temple (Buddhist), Sri Mariamman (Hindu) and Masjid Jama'e (Muslim). The perfect location to experience the very essence of Singapore - the blend of culture from both the religious and culinary aspects.

There are so many different types of food available that I simply provide a few basic concepts of how to choose. First, walk around the entire facility to look at the various stalls and see what they have to offer - there is a great deal to choose from. Second, the signage a each stall will clearly show you the type of food being offered and its price - no need to study a foreign language. Finally, follow the locals - once you have decided what type of food you want
(there will be more than one that sells it) just find the stall with the longest line. The locals come here all the time and they know who makes it best."
,,great choice,5.0,,Plenty of choice; good tasty food; very reasonable prices.
,,"Some very good stalls here, you have to know which ones to try",3.0,,"This is a famous hawker centre in Singapore, but NOT all stores are made equal so you need to know which ones to go for.

Star stores include Tian Tian Chicken Rice (the queue is incredibly long) and the fish soup noodles.

Best to go with a local foodie, or check out a local food guide. If all else fails, check out the reviews often pasted on counters before committing.

Avoid during peak lunch hour - the office crowd turns this place into a nightmare. I find the centre a tad dark and gloomy on the whole - sit near the end facing the temple."
,,Authentic home food at a great price,5.0,,"Discovered this Hawker food market during my last visit. It is absolutely incredible. Plenty of food stalls, a high number of seats that you share and a good number of beer and drinks stalls. This is where you come to for cheap outdoor evening eating. A must. I'll be back!"
,,Authentic and value for money local food.,5.0,,"SGD 4 gets you a delicious plate of fried kway tew or wanton noodles. Very different from the soup version we had in Hong Kong. This is the dry version with chill. The local salad (rolak) of mixed local fruits such as pineapples, mango, tossed with prawn paste in another interesting dish. Chicken rice is another must try item. After the sinful indulgence, coconut juice is another refreshing must have."
,,Brilliant spread of hawker food!,4.0,,"Many are good old hawkers who have been selling for a long long time... Chicken rice, black pepper chicken char siew with rice/noodles, mee siam (my favourite), Hong Kong style porridge, Teochew style porridge, scissors cut Hainanese rice, ngoh heong guan chang, fried kway teow, rojak, spring rolls, etc etc. There have been many new stalls too.

Worth checking it out. Only grouse is the humid Singapore weather which can be quite unbearable in the hawker centre despite the many fans!!"
,,Why the hype,2.0,,"Where is the street food everyone was raving about, a hawkers Centre??? That is not street food, tried various vendors with a variety of foods, I remember the streets of Singapore in the 60‚Äôs what I received as street food was tosh, NOTHING like to days of old, people are easily pleased with the rubbish that is served up. Go to Little India it is better."
,,There are way better Hawker Centres!,2.0,,"Popular with locals, this is one Hawker Centre I‚Äôll be happy to never visit again. The ambiance and surrounds are awful (worse than the average in my opinion). And the food options were limited. Stick with Lau Pa Sat (for a more ‚Äúlocal Hawker Centre‚Äù experience) or Newton (for a more attractive Hawker Centre experience)."
,,Don't forget the juice!,3.0,,Better than other hawker centers but don't go out of your way to go there unless you are in Chinatown. The fresh juice vender has great healthy veggie/fruit combo drinks from $2.50 onwards with ice.
,,Love this place!!,5.0,,All kinds of food but the best - Hainanese Curry Rice. Enough said!
,,Big selection,4.0,,"Our party of 9 made the mistake of having lunch here on a Wednesday afternoon, right on at lunch time. It was one of the places we wanted to try, it was raining and we were in the area anyway, so we headed on over and found the place buzzing with excitement.

First things first - get a seat, and we knew that we'd have to break up into 3 groups and share a table with the locals. They don't bat an eyelid when you ask them, most of them smile at you.

I had dark carrot cake and enjoyed it, but the local serving size just isn't enough for me. Sure enough I could order two serves, but I find it more interesting to try something else. I found a stall selling battered fruit and potatoes, so I had to try the fried banana. It was delish and I thought about going back for another one (after my wife confiscated mine), but the line was too long. That's how you tell a good stall from a great stall...

I know that the weekday lunch rush was probably the worst time to go, but the place was alive with activity and the smell coming from every stall was simply amazing. There's so much to choose from, probably just about any local delicacy you can think of. Fair enough, the seats aren't too comfy and they're like your Macca's seat that don't move, but just swivel, but Maxwell Road Food centre isn't a place you're supposed to linger around after a meal. You go in, get a seat, reserve your seat with a tissue, umbrella or like some brave souls did, your hand bag, get your food, eat it and get out!"
,,Great Food with the worlds Best Chicken Rice,4.0,,"A good hawker centre that is open 24hrs though a little bare during daylight hours. Go here for the best chicken rice, you wont be able to miss the queue to see which is the best!!"
,,Great variety,4.0,,Be prepared to queue at several hawker stalls here. The food is good. Avoid lunch on weekdays.
,,"Pick a stall, any stall...",5.0,,"I ate here twice during a 2 day period. Both the Malaysian laksa and Thai something-or-other were delicious. And at about $4 USD per meal, a downright steal. I would return."
,,Great food at an even better price,4.0,,"Went to Maxwell rd Hawker center twice on our stay in Singapore, had the boneless chicken rice from Young Fun Fat, would recommend a trip to the hawker center its so cheap that you can try a selection of dishes and it doesn't really matter if you don't like some of it! Would definately go back for some real Singaporean food & a lively atmosphere"
,,Dirty and over crowded place with Good & Cheap Food,4.0,,"We tried Chicken rice and Baku Teh. Food was good and cheap. In fact VERY cheap. But quite dirty and crowded. Easy to find, right opposit Chinese Temple."
,,Part of Old Singapore,5.0,,"Such a huge selection of hawker stalls - something for everyone. Look out for the long queues - this is where you will find the best food - also excellent fish soup stalls, and don't miss the sugar cane juice.."
,,Great food choices!,4.0,,"I would go there to eat at Tien-Tien's chicken rice, the fried tofu at Âíå Ë®ò, or gyoza noodles at ‰∏â Â§ö!"
,,Maxwell Road centre dishes out delights,5.0,,"Featuring stall after stall of sumptuous hawker fare, maxwell road is well visited by Singaporeans - whether it's because they work close by and drop in for lunch, or crave for one of the dishings on a weekend. If you don't know which stall to start with, look for those with long queues, or (discretely) look at what others are slurping up."
,,"Excellent food, great atmosphere, cheap and NO tourists",5.0,,"Great value, excellent food, good local atmosphere and located in characterful China Town. Why wouldn't you go there? So slip into something comfortable [no air con here] and feast on the Hainanese Chicken Rice. Bon Apetit."
,,Good chicken rice,4.0,,Very juicy chicken. Very nice. Good value for money. Had to eat 2 to get full.
,,All great food are!,5.0,,"Since lunch the queue is long! Yummy chicken rice, fish soup, bean tofu dessert, roaster duck rice, rojak more more... but i like some of the store are open till late for supper! the non-air con area is clean not too bad."
,,Excellent Feed!,5.0,,"This place is a foodie heaven - everything you'd ever want in Singapore cuisine is here. We loved wandering around the various stalls and trying a little bit of this and that. The stalls are all top class, clean and great tasting food. Check out my blog review - http://theadventuresofmisspiggy.blogspot.com.au/2012/02/hawker-centers-singapore.html"
,,Magic Foodie Moments!,5.0,,"Here is the place to get up close to the locals. We were already on a high before we set foot inside. Trying to read our map as we walked here we had two different people come up and offer assistance and then their tips of what food to try .How nice is that? At Maxwell Centre there were very few tourists and we were rather conspicuous but that was fine because an elderly woman pointed out where to buy beer, a couple of office workers watching us watch the production of doughnuts brought over their supply and insisted we try them. They were delicious but even better was the way the customer turned them in the oil as they waited. Becoming bolder we ventured up to order and the guy in front gave us a rundown on the types and then ordered for us from ""Aunty"". He even turned over the chopsticks to my husband to have a turn manning the giant wok of bubbling oil. A young woman behind me then started advising on the other foods we shouldn't miss. If you love food then Singapore will embrace you. The food was fantastic but this brief connection with the people was even better."
,,Singapore's Best at Reasonable Prices,5.0,,Ever wanting to taste authentic food of Singapore without draining your travel budget? Then go to Maxwell Hawker Center!! They have it all in there. Authentic cuisine at Reasonable Prices. I could not ask for more!
,,Heaven!,5.0,,"What is there to not like about cheap meals that are freshly made and delicious? You will find hundreds of vendors and can easily have all three meals in a day here for under $10 total. Before deciding what to eat, walk through the centre and check out everything available. You can usually spot the most popular ones by the size of the long lines. People WILL wait long time if the food is good."
,,Great variety,5.0,,"Want good food, decent variety, in a more rough like Singapore experience?...than go here!"
,,Its a low cost local food market.,4.0,,No lack varieties... Cheap local food for tourist experience honest price unlike Newton Circus.
,,"A must - visit - Morning,Noon or Night",4.0,,"If you want a true taste of Singapore along with local diners,then Hawker Centres should be a priority.I am focusing on the Maxwell Food Centre as I stayed nearby at The Orchid Hotel.The nearest MRT is Tanjong Pagar,although Chinatown MRT is not that much further away.All the local favourites are available from chicken rice to porridge and much else between.The centre is open from early morning until late in the evening.
As a guide to prices,use the following exchange rate 5 S $ = ¬£2.51/$3.98.
The average meal costs around S$3/4 - which you will surely appreciate while visiting Singapore -- a generally pricey destination in my opinion.
Just pick a table and make your choice from around the stalls.A lot of the stalls have a ""set"" meal which you can choose - or you can have a bespoke choice to suit your taste.Helpful photographs are often provided making the selection process easy.
I particularly like Nasi Lemak as a breakfast/brunch option and at S$ 2.50 is both delicious and superb value.There is also a stall providing ""muslim"" style cooking with roti for those who like their food with a twist of the Indian sub-continent. I have attached some photographs of these.
Seperate drinks stalls cater for most tastes from fresh juice to ""teh tarik"",soft drinks and beer.
On one of my visits,a large group of local primary school children visited.This attests I believe both to hygiene standards and the importance of the centre to local life and culture.For a slice of Singapore life be sure to visit a hawker centre during your trip."
,,Just same as many other hawkers,3.0,,"Except for the crowd and prices, all the same. Unless you really have the time to queue up for 'popular' food, all else are the same"
,,"Good food, hot and crowded",3.0,,Good food but don't go during lunch hour because of the office worker crowd. Go half-an-hour earlier.
,,Wide variety of good local delicacies,4.0,,"Maxwell is a great place is you are looking out for tasty, reasonable priced local food. The chicken rice there is a must, the porridge is also good and local desserts are just yummy."
,,A very Singaporean experience,5.0,,"Any visitor to Singapore needs to visit a Hawker Centre at some point to really have a ""local"" experience. Maxwell Road is one of the better ones with a variety of great stalls."
,,"It still retains many original street hawkers but many have gone, so time is also running out..",4.0,,"I have been regularly visiting the hawker centre over the last ten years, average once or twice a month. All I can say is that, overtime, it is slowly losing its charm, as far as the quality of food is concerned. Some stores I have totally given them a miss - such the the peanut soup which has become more diluted notwithstanding the gradual price increases from $0.70 up to $1 and up and up. The very few stores that resisted raising their price too drastically are obviously able to retain old customers and have longer Q. It is a place to visit for old time seek before it transforms itself into yet another food court or worse still when the tourism board has its hands on and screwing it up like the Newton Circle and Lau Pa Sa."
,,Not as good as we had experienced before.,3.0,,"Although many of the stalls were still there, there is a real feel that many have lost the plot. Indigenous people still populate the Centre in droves, but the best time to eat is at the beginning of the day, rather than a rather tired eventide."
,,The real deal,4.0,,"This has been around for ages and there are a number of popular stalls around. Chicken Rice, Hainanese Curry Cutlet Rice, Hokkien Mee, Cantonese Dim Sum/Porridge....

Prices are reasonable but there are no airconditioning and its free seating. So, avoid lunch hours as it is popular with the office workers around the vicinity.

Another closeby hawker which has tasty and popular local fare is Amoy Street hawker. The queue can be staggering at lunch!!"
,,we miss the old one,2.0,,"getting sentimental and just feels that the Maxwell Market these days are losing in attraction to the old one. The food were so much more delicious and the queue was forever running. Now, you get more options, the place is cleaner, but everything is not the same anymore.... even the ""hum chim peng"" tastes different....the filling was so much more...."
,,Chicken Rice Haven,4.0,,"If you like Singapore style chicken rice this is the place to go to. There are at least four to five stalls with two that are famous. Look for the queue.
The other stall that is a must try is the Ham-Chim-Pang stall. However, they only open after 1pm and close before 4 pm. Look for the queue in the central part of the hawker centre or ask other stall holders for direction. This must be the only stall where you have to cook your own ham-chim-pang."
,,I love Hawker centers!,5.0,,"Great way to sample many cuisines and kid friendly. I suggest printing out a map, since it can be overwhelming to choose!"
,,DON'T go at dinner,2.0,,more than 1/2 of the stalls were closed by 8:30pm on a Wednesday (in February) and the atmosphere was sketchy (something I never thought I'd say in Singapore). Lau Pa Sat has much more character - go there!
,,Good place to eat good food if you do not care for the interior,4.0,,"We had roasted chicken and duck. The food was very good, very tasty and cheap. Only 3.50 - 5.00 SGD per meal. Also reasonable price for beer and other drinks. I would say that this place is perfect for lunch. For dinner I would like to sit in some more cozy and relaxing environment."
,,Bourdain's Chicken Rice Place is not the best at Maxwells,4.0,,"Though I loved the broth, I thought the Chicken Rice was average. The place at the end of that row on the left hand side is much better overall. Nevertheless, Maxwell is fun and tons of locals go there. It's more authentic than Newton and less expensive, too. Enjoy!"
,,Evening Dining,5.0,,We went here during the late evening and there are still stalls open. Nice and cheap dining.
,,Wonderful Congee,5.0,,"I went there during Chinese New Year, Almost shops are closed, including, Tien Tien Hainanese Chicken Rice - the famouse of this place. Then I eat congee instead. It is wonderful. Recommended!!"
,,Best local food centre,4.0,,"I have tried many food centre in Singapore but the best is maxwell. Many choices with local taste and the price is fair enough ( mostly cheaper than Jakarta or KL ). Many stands very famous like Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice and the porridge stand ( I do not know the name is ). One of the weakness of this place is quite far from MRT and if you exit from maxwell MRT station you will be confused because in this area have many food centre like in maxwell food centre. So better you use taxi if you want to go there, and tell Tian Tian to the taxi driver, usually they knew that stand."
,,Good stuff under One Roof,4.0,,"You get one of the best chicken rice, economical mix rice, fuzhou fishball noodles, the fried fritters and lots more under one roof. Although it is between the central busines district and Chinatown, where prices of everything tend to be higher, the price of food is reasonable."
,,Great Hawker Centre in Chinatown,5.0,,"There are lots a great food in this Hawker centre like fried kway Teow, Chicken rice, and lots of local dessert. Not too expensive"
,,OK food centre,3.0,,"I was very disappointed in the Maxwell Road Hawker Centre. I can't put my finger on what it was, maybe a lack of atmosphere, but I think Lau Pa Sat is far superior if you are wanting a hawker centre experience. I won't go back."
,,a favourite,5.0,,"One of the best hawker centres in town. While in the area you may also want to have a look at Club Street and Duxton Hill in the evenings, they have a good selection of cafes and bars. Chinatown is also nearby."
,,Great selections of local delights,4.0,,"Taking aside the non-air conditioned food court, this place is a melting pot of flavors. Every stall has something to offer."
,,Good variety of Cuisines,4.0,,They have only a few places but the variety is good
,,"Yes, this is the hawker Anthony Bourdain went to!",5.0,,"things to try at Maxwell: of course the chicken rice AB went to (his picture is displayed there), Lao Ban beancurd (the popular beancurd stall from Old Airport Road), fried fish bihon soup, congee + raw fish salad... just try all the places with long queues! i love this place because it's a no-frills, nonpretentious hawker centre. be warned, it's next to the financial district so the queues are longer during lunchtime compared to dinner!"
,,"Cheap, Clean with Interesting Delicious Food",4.0,,"Maxwell Road Hawker Centre, one of many hawker centers in the city. I found it to be clean and cheap, with alot of interesting deliious food. Love the Tian Tian chicken rice and Zhen Zhen porridge. Don't forget a cold Tiger Beer with your meal."
,,"Expected it to be better than Newton, but was disappointed",3.0,,"We came to Maxwell to try the Tian Tian chicken rice, but I don't know what all the fuss was about - I was disappointed with what is reputedly the best chicken rice in Singapore. But maybe it's just not for me. I think the atmosphere, and the food, is better at Newton."
,,Best food in Singapore - BY FAR!!,5.0,,"My partner and I ate here twice during our short 4 night stay in Singapore. I have never tasted better food in all my life. I am totally obsessed with Hainanese Chicken Rice and this is the place to get this dish. It's fresh and tasty. I will return to Singapore just to go back the the MAxwell Hawker Centre it was that good!
The atmosphere is very casual as most people call in on their way home from work to get something to eat. The chairs are like that of a food court but if you can see past the seating issue the food is worth it!"
,,Great nasi lemak,4.0,,Brought a friend of mine here randomly to have nasi lemak breakfast and found a gem for only 2.50. It's a popular hawker centre so there is a good atmosphere and it's really well located
,,My pick for hawker should you visit Chinatown,4.0,,"Having gone through an overhaul, it still has one of the best selection of local foods; China-fitters (a selection of chinese picks for deep-fry), Curry rice stall ( a local economical rice-stall served with generous spread of curry gravy on rice) , Sommerset (fried noodles and rice: Malay Mee-Goreng and Salted fish fried rice), Tian Tian hainanese chicken rice are not to be missed."
,,Love everything about this Hawker Centre,5.0,,"Ondeh ondeh, pau, porridge, cheap and good fruit juice etc. etc. etc."
,,Nice local food,4.0,,Typical local food eaten in typical style that is a short walk from Tanjong Pagar train station. Try the fried dough snacks that you have to cook yourself.
,,a taste of singapore,4.0,,"this is one of the few remaining hawker centres which offer authentic singapore food. the place is always packed with office workers from the offices nearby, and so judging by the queues of the stalls, you can roughly gauge which are the nicer/cheaper food around town."
,,No!,1.0,,Forget about going to this Hawker Centre! Dirty and can't find good food!
,,Busy hawker center with some greats stalls,4.0,,"Maxwell Road Hawker center is one of Singapore's busiest and best known food centers. There are probably around 50 small stalls selling a wide variety of Chinese, Indian, and Malay fare. There's also a stall selling Thai food and plenty hawking drinks, beers, and juices, including fresh sugar cane juice. The best known food stall is Tian Tian Chicken Rice, repeatedly voted the best chicken rice stall in Singapore. Singaporeans love their chicken rice so this is a great endorsement. There's also a wonderful stall in the center lane selling probably the best chicken porridge I have had in Singapore. (There's always a long line here) The mealls cost around $3-6 Singapore dolllars, which is a great deal anywhere. I suggest that you walk up and down all aisles before settling on a stall. The ones with the longest lines are usually the indicator that these are the best (and most popular with Singaporeans). It gets very crowded around lunch time as the center is near both Chinatown and a number of office buildings. A number of stalls close down in the evening so the widest range is at lunch time."
,,Good Option for local food,4.0,,"In Chinatown, this is a great food option with many hawker stalls for good local food and cheap beer. It is also close to Club Street and associated bars around that area, so a great stop off before or after a night out."
,,One of the LAST real hawker centers in Singapore,5.0,,"Maxwell Road Hawker Center is a bit gritty (for Singapore) and heavily Chinese but definitely serves up some of the best traditional Singaporean dishes. If you want to experience a true hawker center (short of going out to an HDB estate... where no tourist is going to venture), then this is the place to be. Compared to the hassle and overpricing at Newton, Maxwell is a breath of fresh air! I recommend a visit... who knows when modernity crazed Singaporeans will ""renovate and sterilize"" it!!!! Take note: This place is open nearly 24 hours but not all the stalls are open all the time. Some are only breakfast/lunch. Some only lunch. Some only dinner/late night. There is rarely a time you will go when it's 100% open."
,,Filling Meal on a Budget,4.0,,"Just across the Chinese temple, this Hawker center offers a variety of choices. We arrived at around 2pm so the place wasnt crowded. We had a bit of difficulty in conveying to the stall owners what we wanted since a couple didnt speak english. but sign language and a smile cleared things up.We tried four different dishes from four different stalls and we had a feast without burning our pockets. The area was well ventilated and passably clean. Stall owners were friendly. If you want a filling meal on a budget, this is the place to go."
,,Good Hawker Centre,4.0,,"has a good comprehensive choice of Hawker fare, must try the steamed Chicken Rice."
,,Great food only partially open at night,3.0,,We live in Bangkok so we are used to 24 hour food stalls. The food was great but the options were limited.
,,Smelly & Tasty,4.0,,"This hawker center is very close to Chinatown in Singapore, and sure it's better choice than eating in Chinatown streets. Every stall has it's own stuff from delicious din-sums to fresh fruits. Grab your food and have a seat.

however it's not a good choice for breakfast or coffee (no, don't have a coffee here, just walk few behind the Scarlet hotel, there are nice coffeeshops)"
,,Shabby but with old school hawker cuisine,5.0,,"OK - it may look a bit down at heel but there is some excellent food in here. Tian Tian Hananese Chicken rice cannot be bettered - yes it is worth the wait in line. Normally asian desserts leave me cold but Xing Xing Tapioca cake and onde onde are delicious. Get there early, queue and hope the person in front of you does not clean them out!"
,,Excellent choice for a real taste of local culinary,5.0,,"I used to patronise this place whilst working in the nearby office. This place is fantastic that offers highly affordable and wide array of food (with Malay, Indian and Chinese cuisine primarily). It's one of the best location for anyone wanting to get a flavour of the type of food locals go for. Just one word of caution: avoid the lunch time crowd."
,,A wide variety of food selections!,4.0,,"Have been visiting this coffeeshop for the past few months when I visit Maxwell Road every month. It has been great having supper with friends after partying till late around the area.

There is a wide variety of food, however, do note that when it's in the wee hours, only a few shops are opened such as Bar Chor Mee stall / Porridge stall etc despite it is stated as 24hrs.

Love the Thai food that i found there and also the porridge!

Brought my family there after discovering this place.

Will be back!"
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Only a few minutes walk from Hotel 1929, I decided not to miss the Maxwell Hawker Centre. Had Tian Tian chicken rice for $3! You just can't beat this for value."
,,Lots of choice and fantastic value,4.0,,Food is freshly cooked and everything is clean. Cold beer as well. People are very friendly and strike up conversations as you eat.
,,"Heaps of tasty, cheap meals",5.0,,It may not look all that appealing and the tables not that clean but don't get put off from coming here. Have a wonder about the numerous stalls and grab a selection of meals and juices from here that are delicious. You won't be disappointed.
,,"Very cheap meal in clean, safe environment.",3.0,,My daughter and I visited the Maxwell Food Centre one evening before heading on to the observation deck of Suntec City. We had satay and rice and were happy with our choices which were cooked promptly and served piping hot. The food centre is undercover so you can escape the rain and gets very busy. Recommended for a quick bite to eat at a super cheap price.
,,Can't believe I waited so long to visit,5.0,,"Wow! what a cool place to have a meal. I had heard about this place on TA and how it was not a tourist trap, but more of a place for locals. I never knew it could be so good.

I ate at Tian Tian Chicken Rice, but we sat down out the front of China Street Fritters (Stall 64). It was one of the best decisions I have ever made on a holiday.

The owner (Richard) came and sat down next to us and started chatting with us, and then some of the other older locals came and sat with us all whilst eating their lunch.

Richard was so friendly that he then gave me a sampler of his China Street Fritters famous Egg Slice / Pork Sausage / Meat Roll & Liver Roll. Talk about pressure - as an Aussie trying to look competent with Chopsticks with 6 locals watching is great. We had such an amazing experience we didnt want to leave.

The Maxwell Food Centre is a really great place to go and eat authentic dishes, but take some time and be open to chatting with the locals and the vendors, they honestly made our trip for us.

I do hope that it doesn't become too touristy, because this is a real gem in Singapore's increasingly modernised and touristy exterior."
,,Excellent food & variety! This is where locals eat!,4.0,,"The Maxwell Food Center in Chinatown is one of the best places to eat in the city! The stalls are numbered and easy to find‚Äî many only serving one specialty dish, as is the case with Zhen Zhen Porridge (#54). We went for breakfast, and the line was an hour long. I wasn‚Äôt sure if the guidebook recommended it because it was so popular or if it was so popular because the guidebook recommended it. Judging by all the locals waiting in line, I decided it was the former. This rice porridge comes with chicken or fish, scallions, some fried crispy stuff on top, and a raw egg, which cooks in the hot porridge. I added raw chilies for some more flavor. It was good and certainly worth trying, but it‚Äôs just not a Westerner‚Äôs idea of breakfast. The next morning we had a toasted coconut roll pastry at Pan Cake (#26). Definitely more my kind of breakfast! We rounded that out with a fried dough fritter, a cup of Kopi coffee, and sugarcane juice with lemon. The Maxwell Food Center is definitely a must!

,,Cheap and amazing! You can't go wrong...,5.0,,"Here is a dose of local life. An open air hawker centre with incredibly, incredibly affordable and delicious food. Tian Tian chicken rice is famous around these parts, and try the fantastic Malaysian food with coconut rice on a banana leaf. Lots of Chinese cuisine as well. You can't go wrong with anything you pick here. Bring napkins!"
,,Good value authentic food,4.0,,"The centre is undercover fortunately as it was raining heavily when we arrived. Obviouly very popular as it was difficult getting a seat. We were not very adventurish but all the meals chosen were enjoyable. At $3 - $7 each its possible to get a good number of dishes between all of us without threatening the budget.
I would recommend at least one food market experience whilst visiting Singapore and you are pretty safe with Maxwells"
,,Three Singapore dollars for Chicken Rice!,4.0,,"My family and I went to experience local food court for the first time. The food court has various options, but one for the chicken rice among those that were was crowded. We ordered two chicken rices, and one stir-fried Bok Choy, that sum up only to 12 Singapore dollars! So cheap for the taste and the local atmosphere.
Oh, be careful to keep your seat - I followed my husband's advice to put some paper napkins to keep the seats but they were removed."
,,It is one of the old-time food centres with many popular stalls,4.0,,"This is no doubt one of the popular food centres in town, especially during lunch time for office workers working around the area. It is so crowded.
Many famous stalls still as popular as before, and attract crowds. E.g. Zhenzhen porridge stall, Tiantian chicken rice, fish soup bee hoon which is just opposite Zhenzhen porridge stall (if I don't remember wrongly). Not to forget the uncle who handmakes onde onde (local snack) and it is by far the best onde onde in town, sold out by lunch time. His tapioca kueh is also popular.
If possible, go before noon. Otherwise you will be wasting your time queuing up..."
,,"Didn't expect it to rank this high, but it's good enough",3.0,,"I never expect a food centre could rank this high on TA, but this food centre has several good choices, try the genuine Singaporean dishes they got here, of if you want something different, it has other alternatives such as Philippines cuisine."
,,"Visited Many Times, Affordable Food & Found A Saver",4.0,,"I was introduced to this place by my Singaporean colleague while working in Singapore. Oh boy! I love this place & came back several times to try different dishes. Chicken rice is my favourite and I ate it several times :). I found that the proper name is ‚ÄúHainanese Chicken Rice‚Äù.

The best time to visit is just before or after lunch hours as there are less people. Try not to come during lunch hours on weekdays if you want to take your time to savour the many selection. The food here are authentic local dishes at super affordable prices. SGD 5 will get you very satisfying local meal.

One kind fellow mate I shared table with handed me a copy of a printed guide. He said he downloaded from TravellerFoodGuide.com. To my delight, I learned that there are ‚ÄúWhite‚Äù and ‚ÄúBlack‚Äù chicken rice and I can choose breast or thigh meat. The best part - I can place my selection without speaking a word of Mandarin. I marked my selection in English on the guide & a corresponding Chinese version is provided. I handed my selection to the stall assistant and he seems to like it too. Thanks Mate!

This guide was a saver for me as I won‚Äôt know there are different variety of my favourite chicken rice. I will definitely get a copy of this guide when I visit Singapore again. I was told that most stall assistants don‚Äôt speak English & I will use this guide to overcome the communication barrier. There are several places recommended in the guide that I intend to try too."
,,Simple but fantastic hawker food,4.0,,"Been here a number of times. Like the fish soup and the porridge/ congee. The congee stall is pretty big, serving raw fish as well. This raw fish is the chinese answer to japanese sashimi. The raw fish comes with cut rain chilli, vegetables, cut green onions and coriandar leaves (if i am correct). Its fresh and does not has the fishy taste or smell. The porridge is nice too. Great value and anytime for a meal.

Its hawker so no service and no atmosphere as usual."
,,True hawker food at it's best,5.0,,"Awesome food court that was recommended to me by a cab driver. I was really pleased to see how clean the place was, hawkers were very friendly and more importantly the value is second to none. Most dishes were not over $4SGD so you can definitely eat til your completely full without breaking the budget. We had the mixed bbq meats and seafood hor fun. Great place!"
,,A down-to-earth experience,5.0,,"It is said that in Singapore, you can either have a $3.50 meal or a $350 meal, or something in between. The Maxwell Hawker Center is definitely for those on a budget who want a cultural experience. It is made up of stalls of various types of cuisine ranging from Chinese to Indian, savory to sweet, and a nice variety of juice bars. Between the rows of stalls stand tables and chairs so that at least three hundred people can be eating there at any given time. The hawker center itself is basically a roof on posts and is basically open door. The food is great and so are the drinks. I wouldn't have missed this experience."
,,The Best of Chinatown in One Convenient Location,4.0,,"Maxwell Food Centre is a great option for quick low-cost eats in Singapore's Chinatown. Not surprisingly, emphasis is on Chinese food at this hawker center and the choices are widely varied. Easy to find something tasty and filling for S$3 or S$4. I've eaten in here any number of times over the last ten years, no specific recommendations, just find something that looks interesting and go for it! Word to the wise: make sure you establish the price at any stall serving seafood that's otherwise unpriced or else you may be in for a surprise! The only downside to the Maxwell Food Centre is its popularity: it can be difficult to find an available table. Usually easy to share space at a table if dining alone but seating can be an issue if dining in a group."
,,Great food - unbelievable prices - a cultural experience,4.0,,"You simply must eat here every day while in Singapore. Try the chicken rice, the fruit stands, the smoothies. I ate here for dinner three nights in a row - total cost 11 USD. The service is not why you go here but I diid notice that people were nicer and more helpful to me because I really didn't know what I was doing or ordering for the most part. All the locals were here, no one paid any particular attention to me so I felt very comfortable wandering around deciding what I wanted. If you can't make decisions easily don't come here - there are too many delicious options!"
,,"Come here for cheap, humble and authentic cuisine",4.0,,"$4 SGD will get you a decent meal and don't worry - everything is good. Trust the number of locals who come here to get a bite. Things to try: Hainanese chicken rice from Tian Tian and ice cendol.

Don't be deterred by the cheap setting and lack of service because it only adds to the atmosphere! SIngaporeans are efficient and this definitely shows in their food culture."
,,Shouldn't write a review ;),5.0,,"We have been several times to Singapore and since we discovered this centre we can only dream of the food served here when we are elsewhere. Some of our favourites: strawberry dragonfruit juice, oyster egg, black pearl soya drink, chicken porridge, big pao, etc.
The pricess are good, the hawkers friendly and the food is some of the best you can find around.
We are only scare by telling other people this that it might turn into a tourist trap like Newton's ;).
Some stalls open around 5.30 and most close before 22.00."
,,One of the best Hawker Centres,4.0,,"One of the nicer Hawker centres in Singapore, situated next to Chinatown it is a great place to stop for a quick/cheap lunch. The choice is similar to many hawkers but the place in general is cleaner and more appealing to those who may feel put off by the hawker experience."
,,So much fun!,4.0,,"We went here after I had seen the Anthony Bourdain 'No Reservations' show on Singapore, where he visited Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken and gushed over it. After doing some research, we had a few other places in the food court that we wanted to check out. The chicken rice was great ($3!), but the chili sauce that goes with it was sublime. We also tried oyster cakes from Fuzhou Oyster Cake, which were being made on the spot and seemed very popular with the locals. We also had a great fish noodle soup from a place whose sign only said Fish Head Bee Hoon and Fish Bee Hoon - the broth was incredible. We also tried the white carrot cake and kway teoy from the stall across from it, which were really tasty. BTW, white carrot cake is not carrot cake - more of a savory radish rice cake. Such a great way to try good cheap food - follow the lines of people, the more the better."
,,Great Singapore Experience,5.0,,"Eating from a streetside food stall is a must in Singapore. Maxwell Road is the best place to take the plunge. Stroll around, see which one is the busiest and join the line. You're guaranteed a tasty meal in vibrant, friendly atmosphere."
,,Once of the Best Centers,5.0,,Try it you will like it. Good Stuff. I need 50 characters......
,,CHINATOWN - GREAT FOOD AT THE BEST PRICES ....,5.0,,"I have just come back from ten days in Singapore and want to recommend the Maxwell Road Food Centre (cnr. Maxwell Rd and Neil Road) to fellow travellers. Its adjacent to Chinatown, so all the attractions here are within walking distance. M>R. Food Court offers many selections of classic Asian dishes, fruit juices (lychee, pineapple, sugar cane fresh pressed) at amazing prices. Cant recommend this place enough. Eat with all the locals ..."
,,"Great desserts, lovely people, authentic experience",4.0,,"We came here on recommendation of the beauty salon owner where we had a massage, picked up some dirt cheap desserts (ice jelly fruit salad, and ice peanut icecream), which came to the grand total of $4. Just a fun atmosphere, so busy yet very friendly."
,,Good place to eat with the locals,4.0,,"There are lots of variety of stores, including Tian Tian (stall 10) which is quite famous for its chicken rice. However, I would suggest that you walk around the whole place first, and then just join one of the longer queues. This seems to be a reasonable indicator of where the best food is."
