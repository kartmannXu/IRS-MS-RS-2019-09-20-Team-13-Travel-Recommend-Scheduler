,,Thank you Florence!,5.0,,We dropped in because we wanted to know how to get around in the city. Florence explained everything very good and gave us super good advices (f.e. how to get to Sentosa without an entrance fee). We‘ve discovered finally Singapore by walk (40km/3 days in Flip Flops) and public bus (always have coins with you). We found some nice things to do without paying a lot. In the Gardens by the bay go all the way to the Marina Barrage. You will find a beautiful sunset with a super nice Skylineview for free. For food try Dublin/Killiney Rd. There is a very small food court at the corner serving buffet for low prices and good coffee for 1.6S$. At Cheers Supermarket we found a good offer for a cheap beer. Grab one and enjoy the Marina View sitting at the Esplanade Theatre. Almost every night you might join a cool Band playing nice songs. For free. Same as the waterfountains jumping up and down in different colors in front of the Hotel Sands by the bay. Shows at 7p.m. and 8p.m. Or just do the riverwalk....impressive views! Also the Artscience Museum at the Marina offers free things to see. Just check it out. Bye the way....I also liked very much that I could find a clean toilette everywhere for free!

She did this in a lively and illustrative way, didn't care about the lae hour and was only satisfied when we were. That was a great and very sympathetic experience.
She also told us that we could try typical local coffee specialties with local sandwiches for free the next morning, so we came back the next day and were served by a very friendly team who explained us the local ways of preparing coffee and why it is called 'kopi'.

,,Staff is very helpful,4.0,,"I usually find myself in this particular visitor centre to ask for directions. Staff is very knowledgable and helpful. If you are traveling with a senior citizen and happen to be in need of directions, do not hesitate to visit, have your senior grab a seat while you ask for directions."
,,Very helpful and friendly Staff,5.0,,"We visited the Singapore Visitor Centre on the 8th June, as we wanted to find out what to see while we were in Singapore for 11 days, We were met by a very friendly member of the visitor centre staff his name was John, John was able to show us where we could see the attractions of Singapore and also he showed us how to work the Singapore MRT, we used the MRT all the time after that, also John's knowledge of Singapore is very very good, We would recommend going to the Visitor centre while in Singapore, if you are going to be staying for a few days"
,,Very helpful staff who spent time with us and listened to our thoughts and were able to advise accordingly,5.0,,Thank you (Laura? British accented English) for spending time with us re benefits of metro vs bus transport. You helped us go by bus (very cheap) down to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel where we spent a wonderful afternoon and evening. Good advice re taking a taxi back to our hotel on Orchard Road also. We really appreciated that you listened to what we wanted to do and the time frame we had to do it in.

,,Definitely worth it to come here to discover what Singapore has to offer!,5.0,,Joey was absolutely amazing with how knowledgeable and passionate was in sharing all the things that Singapore has to offer and the history in this very diverse city. The most amazing service they have here is the custom tourist user interface stations that compile hundreds of different things to do in any category you want from nightlife to nature. It's only available there and nowhere online! It's the best and most complete guide I've ever seen bar none!

,,Great help and very friendly,5.0,,I stopped by the visitors centre late last Sunday afternoon. I only had Monday to have a look around before 2 days of work. John was very helpful with planning my activities for the day and the inside knowledge such as the Singapore airlines boarding pass providing 50+ % discount for the hop on hop off bus. Stop by the visitors centre it will certainly make your stay or more enjoyable.
,,Very Helpful,5.0,,Visited the centre to get some understanding of the rail system and the Singapore Tourist card.We received great advice and help from Shiela who took the time to explain houw to change from one railway system to another. Shiela gave us a Singapore Tourist Pass that explained it all.
,,Friendly Information Center,5.0,,The Singapore Visitor Center is quite popular since its located at an iconic Orchard Road area. Here you will find a self service kiosk including friendly staff who will be able to guide you.
,,Even getting lost can be a good thing,5.0,,"When we were walking around this amazing city, we ended up paying too little attention to the direction we were headed. We were too much focused on the details and so we got a little lost. All the shops on this street got me shopping fever so it is understandable that the head wasn't in the right place :) When we decided it is time to get back on track we found ourselves right in front of the Visitor Centre and they helped us out. Not only they kindly pointed us in the right direction but also gave us some information about ZOO and other sightseeing places. The location is perfect when you want to go away from the shops but you are too tired to make a web research, there they are. More about our time in Singapore you can also read on our blog page. Singapore really is an amazing city!"
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Excellent service from the visitor centre, providing us information in the form of pamphlets and advise...very friendly as well"
,,Very Helpful People,5.0,,"Stopping by here will prove very helpful in your planning of seeing Singapore. Staff very helpful and hones, without trying to push or sell any activity. Lady spent 20-30 minutes with us - pointing out spots on a map and answering our questions."

Everybody who came in received a personal welcome and there were sufficient members of staff to help all visitors."
,,Client Service Exceeded Our Expectations,5.0,,"On our 2nd of 4 days’ sightseeing in Singapore, we visited the Singapore Visitor Centre to get information on several locations that we had seen on initial touring of the city aboard the Hippo/Duck Hop On/Hop Off bus service. We had the good fortune of talking to Joey who not only answered our initial inquiries to our satisfaction but due to her excellent listening skills went over and above to recommend specific options (tours, routes) and useful maps and brochures to maximize our experience and our time availability viewing many of the city’s attractions that we were interested in exploring.
We wish that we had visited on our first day to take full advantage of the advice and local knowledge that Joey provided and encourage other travelers to Singapore to seek out this excellent resource. Thanks Joey, Donna (Ontario,Canada) and John (South Australia)"
,,Pretty Let Down,2.0,,"Our Guidebook suggested that the Visitor Centre was the place to go to find Military History tours. Perhaps we just didn't get the right person, but our question was met with confusion and a flurry of brochures of a general nature. Sad part was we then walked to Fort Canning, only to find that the tour we wanted was offered only a few times during the week."
,,POOR SERVICE,2.0,,"We visited the Singapore Visitor Centre to get information how to get to Jurong Pard Park. Were told best to catch a taxi, not very informative, Decided not to purchase post card or stamp, walked 10 mts further and got 5postcards for SBD2."
,,Helpful advice,4.0,,"The guys here are so helpful, great advice on what to see and do with maps and ticket purchase available."
,,Friendly and helpful,4.0,,We wanted some advice on transport to Legoland Malaysia. Staff very helpful but reluctant to actually book the transport for us.
,,Absolutely stop here! Fantastic visitor experience!,5.0,,"Just as you'd expect - this center is high-tech, friendly, and such a great source of information. The ""create your own itinerary"" interface is easy to use, digital, and made setting up my day in Singapore so much easier. Every country should adopt this system. The only down side? The software used in the office doesn't migrate to the App that they promote - it would be great if the itinerary created using their desktop station loaded into the app on your phone...one has to think that's next!"
,,Go to the Singapore Visiters Center first!,5.0,,"We started our tour of Singapore with the Hop on Hop off bus and our first stop was the Singapore Visitor Center. It was the right thing to do. A very friendly, competent young man named Bryan gave us some much needed advice. He let us know that Raffles was closed so we didn't waste our time going there. We also noticed that all the malls seemed to have the same store we have in the US and he guided us to some areas of Singapore that have more localized options. I highly recommend that visitors to Singapore make their first stop the Singapore Visitors Center."
,,Helpful advice from friendly staff,4.0,,Did not visit but instead rang for tourist information on a specific attraction. Received helpful advice from friendly staff.
,,So Many Options,5.0,,The staff were all very helpful and provided us with lots of brochures so we could look over our options when we got back to our hotel. Singapore is a beautiiful place to visit ~ so glad we got to spend time here.
,,Best information Centre ever!,5.0,,"This was the first stop, day 1 of our holiday. As this was our first time in Singapore, we thought that this was a great place to start for hints and tips. This was a great idea, the staff are 110/100 and are very welcoming, I mean VERY welcoming!! They were very knowledgeable of the area and even helped us with transportation advice. The best part was their IT system where you can plan out your days and print them off, also with a map of where they are and a puplic transport map of bus's and trains. The IT system also included helpful video's. Their Centre had lots of brochures and 1 is very helpful. The price list of everything, including attractions, bus's, trains and much more!!
It would be very helpful to you, (and your family) if you go to Singapore Visitor Centre!!
The staff member who helped us was Lidy, she is the best! We recommend you get her to help you with your stay at Singapore."
,,Standard Visitor Information Centre In A Nice Historic Building,3.0,,"The Centre is on Orchard Road and is where you can start your walk through Emerald Hill, far more interesting that Orchard Road. The centre is quite small and has a number of computer information sites and of course staff to assist. It is all fairly straight forward and does the job ."
,,Friendly and Informative,4.0,,You will never feel lost! Smart idea to have tourist center nearby shopping mall and MRT. The tourist assistant at the center is very friendly and she knows the direction very well.
,,Great advice with a smile,5.0,,"Called in the Orchard Gateway for some advice with regards what to do during our 2 day stop-over in Singapore. We were greeted by Lidy who quickly ran through our interests and put together a suggested itinerary with options. As a result we really made the most of our stay in Singapore. Absolutely fantastic, office and facilities are great and Lidy was fantastic. This should be the first stop for anyone coming to Singapore for the first time."
,,Really helpful people,4.0,,"Planted right in the middle of Orchard Rd, this is a really handy place to pop in to. Right opposite Somerset MRT station. Quite a few staff in there and lots of self-help kiosk type things. We got good detailed advice. They spoke excellent English, even though for most of the ones we spoke with English wasn't their first language."
,,fast enthausiastic service with a smile,5.0,,Went in lost looking for directions to get to Botanical gardens - Jessica offered a map - also showed on tablet bus route if we didn't want to walk. Staff are full of knowledge and passionate.
,,helpful and relevant,4.0,,Our family visited here at beginning of our visit. They were given a personalize itinerary including public transport information and times for each tour/event/venue we wanted to include. This was all put on a customized print out with map. Very helpful.

,,Great place and great people to help your visit be memorable,5.0,,"If you want an easy access, easy answer to how best to enjoy your time here in Singapore, there could be no better place to start! Just explain how long you are here for, what you like and dislike and they will show you where and how best to enjoy your time. It's a MUST GO place for short stay visitors. It's a MUST GO BACK place for people living here - things change and special offers are always coming up!"

,,Small but very informative and great service.,4.0,,"As a tourist, walking shopping at Orchard road is definitely an great enjoyment, but if you are out of idea where to visit, then you should walk into this visitor centre, the staff will be able to answar any of your questions, and recommend you a great place to visit with brochure information. Helpful services with some interesting souvenirs."
,,Excellent service!!,5.0,,"Stopped in to find some information and spoke with Joey. She was very knowledgeable and friendly, and gave freely of her time. We asked many questions, and all were answered with a smile. She not only gave us maps and information, but showed photos on an iPad of where we were headed, so we had an idea of what to look for. Nothing was too much trouble for Joey. We even stopped in again the next day, and once again Joey was very helpful."
,,Helpful,4.0,,"Central location, good information and brochures with information and maps.Staff is friendly. Definitely worth having a visit if you want some information."
,,Should be your first stop in town.,5.0,,We stopped in for some information and instructions and found out so many tourist deals. Since we fly on Singapore Airlines we received a couple discounts. But maps and directions were flying all over the place. :)
,,Not helpfull,2.0,,Was ignored when I went in. Limited information available about local attractions. Staff were only interested if you wanted to book and pay for something.
,,Excellent information,5.0,,After selecting points of interest on the screen and having those printed I received detailed information of transport to these venues.
,,Average welcome,3.0,,"Made a point to visit here for information and leaflets . People in front of us were warmly welcomed while we who were genuinely wanting information were not greeted or asked if we needed help , sort of a lack of enthusiasm about the place . Nice gifts but very overpriced . Nothing to write home about"
,,Great overview of Singapore,5.0,,"Free entry & air conditioning (need i say more) See a scaled down model of Singapore and never get lost here again. Don't miss the detailed drawing by Stephen Wiltshire, a British autistic artist who drew the masterpiece after a 1 hour helicopter ride over Singapore, just amazing. And be inspired by the system for dealing with rubbish in Singapore (genius!)"
,,Good point!,5.0,,If you're new in the city I recommend this place! Get some advices and directions from the staff and go find your favorite part of this little country. Free maps and special offers for tourists.
,,Knowledgeable and helpful staff,5.0,,"I'm a Singaporean returnee who has been away for 12 years and now feel like a tourist in my own country. As I'm interested in the cultural enclaves and heritage buildings here, I visited the Singapore Visitor Centre to get some information. The staff who served me (Joey) was very enthusiastic, helpful and knowledgeable. She even recommended 2 books: ""Singapore Shophouse"" and ""Black and White"", knowing that I have a keen interest in architecture. I highly recommend visitors to come here if you wish to get to know more about Singapore's interesting history and culture beyond the usual tourist attractions."
,,Singapore Visitor Centre,5.0,,"We were in Singapore for 3 days at the end of Jan. We stopped in at the visitor centre on Orchard Road. We were immediately approached by John who welcomed us with a huge smile.. we chatted with him for over an hour. He gave us a great overview of history, and what is happening today.. he loves his city and a chat with him is not to be missed..."
,,Best Thing We Ever Did,5.0,,"We were in Singapore for 10 days and went straight here after we arrived, which was the best decision as they were very helpful and gave us many suggestions and brochures to plan our trip. The most important information they gave us was that Mastercard purchases at many attractions will give you a discount. Also, if you fly with Singapore Airlines, keep your boarding passes as they too will give you discounts on many attractions. We found that between the 2, we saved over a hundred dollars."
,,Helpful Information,5.0,,If it's your first visit to the city pop in to the Singapore Visitor Centre in Orchard Road. Make sure you speak to John. He is a mine of information and helped make our recent three day trip much more fun than it otherwise would have been.
,,Fantastic Service!,5.0,,"On a recent trip to Singapore with my wife and grandson, we visited the SVC in Orchard Road several times. On our first visit we were so well looked after by Ghat Sheng that we asked for her personally on the second visit. Ghat was absolutely fantastic! She was extremely patient and friendly and very knowledgeable. Based on her suggestions and advice we had a great holiday AND saved ourselves quite a bit of money. Ghat and the other SVC staff are true ambassadors for their lovely country. We will definitely be returning in the future."

,,Great place to start & have all your questions answered,5.0,,The centre is based in an old non-descript building on Orchard Rd but once you find it the staff are very helpful & take their time answering all your questions & give you clear guidance. If you are in the area & a first time visitor to Singapore I would recommend a visit.
,,Awesome Friendly Staff,5.0,,Staff were very helpful and offered some valuable advice re transport options no waiting time straight in and out
,,Peranakan Central,5.0,,"The Visitor Centre staff were engaging, resourceful and attentive. Situated on Orchard Road in close proximity to the Peranakan Museum, the architecture alone is work photographing to give the visitor a taste of Singapore's colonial heritage."
,,amazing as usual China Town,5.0,,"Love the experience of the old China town on how Singapore was, (going back to mid 1070's) my Grandkids loved it also."
,,Not that helpfull,2.0,,"Visited in the evening we were the only one in there, not that helpful seemed like the that staff were more interested in chatting (it was getting near closing time). Limited tourist brochure info available although the MRT map we go form there was one of the better ones size wise."
,,Orchard road,5.0,,Its a pretty small building located in the Orchard road . Lots of free information available with pamphlets . The staff is really helpful and offers you great guidance . Cheers
,,Exactly the help we needed,5.0,,We helped by very friendly staff members and were suprised to be helped in Dutch! We could buy our hippo bus tickets right there and step on to the bus directly outside. The staff member explained the map so we ready to go.
,,"Very helpful, great staff",5.0,,I love going to this place. No one is trying to sell you anything. They are forthcoming with honest information and have great tips. Very nice people.
,,It was just opposite my Hotel on Orchard Road No Help on Discounts or Family Trips.,1.0,,"They just sit there and sell the passes. Being a Visitor Centre they need to guide the tourist to best discounted packages. Just hopeless they sit there and sell the passes. My hotel staff was much better to share ways in getting discounted tickets to Jurong, Zoo, Flyer, Marina Bay, Sentosa and Universal altogether I could save close to 150 $$"
,,Very well-advised,5.0,,"I not only was impressed with the technologically high standard of this facility. This is not just another „tourist-office“ to stand in line for to get a set of standard brochures of tourist mainstream activities. Jessie, my very friendly and most helpful consultant achieved a full satisfaction to my somewhat off-the-mainstream inquiries about architecture and food. There were no brochures available, so Jessie smartly improvised by means of the offices‘ high-end digital support features. Thanks again, Jessie - the restaurant advice turned out to be most delicious right away"
,,Fantastic service.,5.0,,Popped in to enquire about some attractions around the city. The staff in there could not be more helpful in their explanations of things to do and how to get to them. Once we had left they even came outside to give us some more tips. Just great help and fantastic service.
,,Very helpful,5.0,,"Staff were very helpful (particularly Joey). Let us know about the hop on hop off bus & could get several options for passes, we took 2 day pass."
,,Wish I had found this center sooner,5.0,,"We came across the Visitor Center on our last day in Singapore and I was disapppinted we didn't find it sooner. The staff is very knowledgeable and will help with directions, tickets, and whatever you may need. Each month they have a fun activity upstairs which is a must do. We were able to cool off and regroup while our children iced delicious gingerbread cookies. Again wish we had gone in on day one of our vacation."
,,The best.,5.0,,"They treated me excellent. Rosie and the staff are there to help you, they are so nice, they will introduce you to Singapore and all the activities within the city; temples, restaurants, nightlife and events. They are the best. They even gave me a cookie."
,,Friendly,4.0,,"Useful visitor's centre along orchard road, next to centerpoint. A handful of friendly staff to guide you on where to go, what to see and eat. Nice local souvenirs inside too"
,,Extremely helpful,5.0,,Very helpful and knowledgeable staff. They helped us get the right tickets and even suggested how we could get discounts.
,,Visit this before you do anything else!,5.0,,"Wonderful service by very knowlegeble staff. Very friendly and happy to help! You can book tours here, or just get information, they also let you know if something was worthwhile or not, which saved us quite a few dollars.Brochures of every kind available for free too."
,,"Shopping madness, but everything you could desire",4.0,,"It just goes on and on and on. Everything is there from designer items to simple cheap souvenirs.If you hunt you will find a bargain, but there is a lot of emphasis on high end shopping"
,,SOOOO Helpful,5.0,,This place walked us through so many of our tourist ideas and went above and beyond to make everything absolutely clear. You can get an MRT card here and then you just have to top it up.
,,Very Helpful,5.0,,We stopped here early in the morning after breakfast. The lady who served us was super friendly and knowledgeable. She was so happy and proud of her city. You can also get a sim card here for your phone which was $15 and gave us 15gb which they set up for us.
,,Best tourist information center,5.0,,"This is the best tourist information center I have visited (I have visited 15 to 25 in Europe, Kaula Lumpur and Sydney). The staff is very helpful and patient. I was welcomed by Mrs. Guat Cheng and she helped me to organize my whole trip of 6 days in Singapore. I didn´t do much research before I travelled to Singapore about the things to visit. I was extremely satisfied with the service in this information center. They have a digital service where you can browse all attractions and things to do in Singapore and just click in ""add to itinerary"" if you are interested. When you are done, the staff helps you to organize the things you are interested to do/see depending on how many days you will stay there. Their advice is valuable. Then, they print out your itinerary and the information of each thing you are interested in (such as opening times, prices, how to get there, etc). All this took less than 20 minutes. It would have taken me 3 to 4 days of internet research. Of course, they also provide information about the best way to move around Singapore.
In my opinion, the system they use is the one of the best ways to get help to organize holidays. It is systematic and very well designed. By far, this is the best tourist information center I have ever been. Practical, fast, and friendly. Congratulations to the team working there!"
,,Good service. Need to improve on traveler’s needs.,3.0,,"Very friendly team and willing to assist. We needed internet access and one of their staff directed us to the cashier to purchase a SIM card. The cashier then said no stock and asked us to go to the nearest telco outlet. But didn’t give directions or guide us like what other Visitor Centre does. We had to ask.
In the end she just mentioned to go behind Orchard Gateway. So we got lost and gave up.
When we inquired at our hotel concierge, he searched online for the nearest outlet and gave directions with a map"
,,Checking out information re tourist highlights,4.0,,"Visited the Singapore Tourist Centre and enquired about the local bus transportation and the staff were very helpful and informative. At the same time when we were there ,there was a [poe- pneah} spring roll demonstration upstairs and I was able to attend and taste the freshly made spring roll .All customer service personnel were very friendly and helpful."
,,Great service,5.0,,"Excellent service! The staff is willing to help and make your stay in Singapore better, you can plan there what you want to visit and the best day to do each attraction. They have several discounts. It totally worths to visit it!"
,,Best .. Any time everytime,5.0,,Visited this place when it was almost closing time but they were very courteous & patient to my queries and were very helpful even after the store closing hours they help me with my queries & guided to visit the places .. I don't recall the name of the person who guided me & helped me plan my last 2 days of singapore but she was gem of a person..She watches indian movies is all what i recall but this visitor center & the people who work here are amazing .. I just loved the way they hosted me
,,Fantastic activities and superb advice,5.0,,"I’m in town with my sisters and sought out the Singapore Visitor centre after reading about it in a guide. This is our first day and the advice we were given was invaluable. Thank you to Joey, who was an absolute gem, and gave us much helpful advice and kept us well entertained!
We actually turned up as I read about the activity section upstairs and we were thrilled to be able to be shown how to make our own Singapore spring rolls which were so, so good!
Highly recommend a visit here."
,,Very Disappointing.,2.0,,"Very small interior with a few computers to use or for staff to use. Was disappointed with the lack of material to read or to collect. There was more information located in the lobby of my hotel. I'm sure the staff and the computers would have been very helpful but I just wanted to gather some reading material to take away to read at my own pace and decide what to do and not to be held up there for a while searching on computers with staff and then feeling obligated to purchase tours or entrance tickets on the spot. Leaflets have handy information on them such as opening times, locality maps and how to get there directions and are extremely useful to have inside your travel bag. There was a tiny gift area at the back of the room up a couple of steps that was not worth the effort. Wouldn't waste. time going there again unless I knew that there was a large amount of information readily available to me to look over and take away. The Chinatown visitor centre is 100% better to visit."
,,Holiday in singapore,5.0,,The gentleman that served us was so helpful. The information given was unbelievable. Made our trip so much more enjoyable
,,So helpful,5.0,,"We found this by accident, went inside and were nervous that we were being accosted for a sale, we couldn't be more wrong, the lovely people inside asked us what we were interested in and then told us how to go about doing it, no sales at all! One great tip they imparted was that by showing our plane boarding passes we could get discounts to several od Singapores attractions."
,,Very helpful staff,5.0,,"Our most recent visit to Singapore was visit number 12. Although we know this wonderful city/state so well, a call into the Singapore Visitor Centre is a must. There is always something new to see and the staff at the Visitor Centre have the information and the maps available.
The Singapore Visitor Centre is situated in an ideal position in Orchard Road close to the Somerset MRT and there are a number of shopping centres nearby.
Our particular thanks to Joey for her very helpful assistance in providing us with maps and brochures.
We are already looking forward to our next holiday in Singapore. First point of call will be the Visitor Centre."
,,"Very helpful, useful as first place to visit",5.0,,"Very friendly and helpful staff, the touchscreen system on which you can put together a five-day itinerary and then have it printed is both really useful and extremely easy to use.

Plenty of leaflets, free maps etc too, so well worth popping in and easy to find from the Somerset MRT station."
,,Just what any visitors centre should be!,5.0,,"Organized to perfection, kind and helpful people ready to answer any question a visitor may have. What can expect more ?!?"
,,Recommend,5.0,,"You should visit this place for sure! It's not only helpful in searching for the new places, but also educational! Every month they have different traditional exhibitions like food, writings, history and etc. where you can not only see and learn but also try yourself. Today we spontaneously came and there was a class of cuisine. We were showed how to make a dish and then made it ourselves and ate. Really fantastic atmosphere. People there are very welcoming and we enjoyed the warm setting. We are coming back on our next trip to Singapore to visit a new exhibition :) special thank to Lidy, Michael ker, Yanxin and Rosie who made our stay better at the center today!"
,,"They know what's up, cause there's not much up.",3.0,,"Being in the neighbourhood and having previously seen the 200+ 5-star reviews, I thought to check out Singapore Visitor Centre.

I don't know what I was expecting. Should keep in mind that while The Louvre is 5-stars, so is Singapore Visitor Centre. Just on a different spectrum.

This is not the Louvre. Nor is it of any interest to a local. You might go here if you were a lost tourist in the area and didn't have the internet.

The team assured me that they always have something going on here - indeed, on my visit there were lame cardboard models of all your favourite local landmarks, pushed to the side of the room. I take this with a grain of sand though - it is their job to hype SG.

Singapore Visitor Centre is not the Louvre, and SG is not Paris."
,,Very helpful,5.0,,I had reason to visit this centre for information as to how to find certain sites in downtown Singapore. This office and the workers here were only too helpful and willing to help..just like the rest of Singapore everyone was very sweet. Good job guys
,,Check in with Joanna,5.0,,"All the staff here are so helpful, we were assisted by a lovely lady called Joanna. Nothing was too much trouble for her. Thank you so much."
,,So helpful,5.0,,We arrived by ship into Singapore and were given incorrect directions to our hotel - just a matter of turning left instead of right - and after walking for ages stumbled upon the Visitor Centre. The staff couldn't have been more helpful and gave us several options for travelling to our hotel.
,,Helpful Experience,5.0,,"Visited tnr visitor centre on out first day

,,Make the Visitor Centre your first destionation in Singapore,5.0,,"We had planned our itinerary before heading to Singapore (partly using their website among others) but thought we would go there to see if they could advise us on anything worth adding to or dropping from our planned itinerary. They could & did!. They asked about the types of experiences that we wanted; how we wanted to get around and what types of food we liked. As we spoke, they used their excellent in-house system to create an updated itinerary for us that included a map with all of our destinations specially marked. They then printed that off for us (double sided) and also emailed it to us. Brilliant and very helpful. Various staff there worked collegiately to give us the best advice - and in a clear and helpful manner.

As I said in the title, it is really worth seeing them first to get the most out of a holiday in Singapore."
,,Very helpful,5.0,,Highly recommend making the Singapore Visitor Centre your first port of call when you arrive in Singapore. Very helpful staff.
,,Timely and precise service,5.0,,"We had about 8 hours in Singapore and were not sure what to do. We just walked in asking for assistance. An agent approached us immediately and after asking a couple of questions opened up a map. On the map she showed all the major spots, including the transportation options between them. Quite quickly we knew what to do with our time!"
,,Helpful service,5.0,,It's well worth the visit to this centre. The staff are wonderful and very informative. They have great knowledge and are very happy to help. We were greeted by a very lovely lady named Anna who helped us to setup and itinerary. This is an excellent service.
,,Good information,4.0,,We didn't find anywhere in Singapore willing to recommend places to go but this visitor centre has all the information once you have decided. Very friendly staff.
,,the government gives so much value to Visitors...,5.0,,"THE GOOD: friendly staff, excellent location in the vicinity of hundreds of shopping outlets

THE BAD: long queues during peak hour.

TIPS: get as many questions asked at the Counter... that's the way u get info which normally would require u to pay for a local guide... HUGE SAVINGS THERE..."
,,As good as they come.,5.0,,staff speak most languages and dont just tell you how to get to places they recommend the cheapest way .

,,Excellent service!! 👍🏼😊,5.0,,"For all tourist who feel like lost or even do not.. go there and get some interesting details for your singapore trip. Don‘t think you know everything, for sure you know nothing. BUT after a visit there you can relaxed enjoy your singapore stay. Because you know whats going on.. the employees there known singapore very well. For example Joey, she told us also a short history about singapore.. her personal advices and gave us a lot of maps and she (like the others) gave us a lot of time to feel sure what to do.. it‘s not like you have just 10 minutes and then you have to go. NO, she gaves us so much time we need.

A must for every tourist.

@ Joey, thanks for all your advices. We tried to do all of them, but we have to come again.. and also the bus transport to malaysia we organized by our selfes.. THANK GOD WE MET YOU!!"
,,Great service,5.0,,Go upstairs with young kids. Made Moon cakes and one 2 tickets to the zoo. Got correct information on Legoland as was very difficult to book from the hotel.
,,Must visit Singapore Visitor Centre,5.0,,"Singapore visitor centre is centrally located in Orchard Road, very helpful staff, lots of free information available to visitors, try to visit at the begining of your Singapore staying. We specifically had a wonderful experience with Joey, she provided excellent information, as we were looking for a very good restaurant to eat Singapore food, Joey called and made reservations, and provided excellent ideas as to what to see around the restaurant area, and for the rest of our staying in Singapore. Very resourceful group."
,,Singapore visitor centre..,5.0,,"Singapore visitor centre is located in orchard road and they work till 9 30 at night. They are. Very specialised in providing almost all the help for the travellers to singapore. We can get into the sight seeing trips, new mobile connections, metro smart card from this centre. They are so helpful that even a stranger to the place will feel relaxed. Thanks for providing us help during our trip in singapore."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"An early visit to a Visitor Centre can set up your whole holiday in a new city. When we visited The Singapore Visitor Centre we were immediately greeted with a welcome and John quickly gave us all the information we needed. A bag full of maps, timetables and directions helped us on our visit to this wonderful city! Thankyou John and all the staff at Singapore Visitor Centre."
,,"friendly staff, lot's of information. :)",5.0,,"I was visiting Singapore last year and didn't make it to the visitor centre until halfway through my stay. Wish I had gotten there sooner!

I was assisted by a very friendly an knowledgable man named John, and the tips he gave me definitely improved my stay in Singapore. :)

This should be every tourists first stop when they get to Singa! :)"
,,Great help!,5.0,,"What wonderful help and service we received here. Apart from getting maps, pamphlets and other helpful information, it was all given by a friendly, very kind gentleman."
,,Extremely helpful staff,5.0,,"Staff are friendly, patient and very helpful. Stopped in here to get some suggestions on where to find local designers and their suggestions were perfect."
,,Interesting,4.0,,I recommend a visit here for useful maps and leaflets. I liked the watercolour reproduction cards of old buildings in the little shop and got two of those which I will get framed - very nice. They gave me a useful little bag to put everything in - much appreciated.
,,If you are short of time the best place to recommend the key places to visit for tourists,5.0,,"Location of the office is the best i have encountered in a lot of travel at various countries i have been. The staff is superbly trained and have a Bank full of options for visitors who want to see everything in the shortest period of stay and time. Ever willing Staff who are not just working for a eight hour shift but are helpful knowledgeable and can give numerous options to tourists., not only to save time for the best sight options but even gave us how to make the trip economical and what would be the best option of travel , sight seeing ticketing options and the best visit sightseeing timing to pack in more of the itenary . We were lucky as the F1 was in progress so got a glimpse of it from the Marina Bay sands hotel too just because the willing and enthusiastic staff recommended it strongly. Honestly to have a tourist office in the heart of the city is more welcomed rather than at the airport as the traveler is tired after a flight so he tends to be short or disinterested but this city office staff was just amazing and in fifteen minutes gave us the best options."
,,Helpful,4.0,,This is a must visit centre to get all the information for the various tours and attractions around Singapore. The staff is very helpful and knowledgeable. You can maps that you dont normally find in the hotels and airport.
,,Simple Singapore Service,4.0,,"Visited the Singapore Visitor Centre in Orchard Road we were greeted by friendly and helpful team who gave us excellent service, advice and plenty of brochures for all the attractions and tours we wanted"
,,Plenty of useful information,4.0,,"There's really a lot of information in the Visitor Centre, even if you're local. Some of the more obscure attractions might be a little tricky to get details for (such as the Balestier Heritage Trail), but the staff still make a real effort to help. Definitely worth a visit if you're planning some sightseeing in Singapore."
,,It is worth a visit!,5.0,,Stephen was very friendly and helpful. We went to have some information about the city and he told us a lot of tips and things to do.
,,Incredibly Helpful and Informative,5.0,,"We visited the centre trying to find out about bus times, but discovered so much more...

The staff were really helpful and knowledgable (particularly John). We learned all about the history of Singapore, about its independence and also about what it's like to live there today. I honestly think this was a better learning experience than even exploring a museum. We also were given lots of useful tips about where to visit in the city and what times provide the best experience.

It wasn't busy when we were there, so we enjoyed chatting to John for about an hour. This was completely worth stopping at - if you are visiting Singapore for more than a couple of days I would recommend getting here on the first day, as it is helpful for planning where/when to visit on your stay. (Although for shorter trips it would still be useful)."
,,First class assitance,5.0,,"Five of us popped into the Visitor Centre first thing Sunday morning. We were greeted like we were long lost friends. The staff could not possibly have been more helpful. They asked US what we wanted to see and gave heaps of great and relevant advice. Absolutely the FIRST place you need to visit, especially if it's your first time to Singapore. A special thank you to Audrey for her assistance and suggestions in a really professional & friendly manner - turns out she is a Trainee!!"
,,Great first stop when visiting Singapore,5.0,,"We called in to pick up maps, details of the MRT - public transport and offers or deals that could save us time and money. We had a great response from the staff and tottered out with a bag full of great information. It helps if you know what you want otherwise it is hard for the staff to fulfil your needs except to give general information and you may be disappointed."
,,"A nice place to stop by, for 5 minutes...",4.0,,"Friendly, professional and knowledgeable folks to assist you, if you need to, with your travel plans... You see mostly older folks, couples who stop by here and check it out, get some advice. Nobody younger with their mobiles at their fingertips and able to find info quickly would be caught in here;) Still, some old-fashioned random human-to-human talk can be refreshing at times..."
,,Disappointed,3.0,,"Being just across the road from our hotel, we dropped in to get some details on the MRT Tourist Pass. The Staff could not have his been less interested in us, we were not greeted warmly and while my question in regard to purchasing the Pass at Somerset MRT was answered, we were offered no further suggestions or opportunity to receive guidenace on any aspect of our holiday. As this was the first day of a six days in Singapore, some friendly suggestions or advice would have been welcomed. To say we were disappointed is an understatement. We got more helpful unsolicited advice from the gentlemen serving at the Magnum Shop in Ion Orchard!!"
,,Very friendly and helpful,5.0,,We stopped in on our first morning. They helped us with purchasing our MRT tickets. We saw other visitors centre's about on our travels and found them all very helpful. This one situated on Orchard road is in a beautiful old Singapore style shop house right in the middle of high rise everywhere.
,,Good way to start Singapore tourist trip,5.0,,"You may have planned everything as a tourist in Singapore but this place is recommended for first timers to see what interesting options these guys throw up aside from the usual attractions.

Spend 20-30 mins and ask them places to eat, suggestions for night life or even bounce off some of your planned ideas with them. If you are being addressed by a competent person (usually the case) then you'd be pleasantly surprised.

The only thing this place does not have is a rest room so it cannot be used a 'rest stop' (pun intended)."
,,Saved us,5.0,,Thanks to the team who I found went beyond the call of duty. Very focused on helping us and provided an outstanding level of support and advice to make our visit to Singapore even more enjoyable. Place to go for info.
,,Useful stop for information,5.0,,This place located on Orchard Road is a great place to drop by and pick up any information you may need about Singapore. They help you plan itineraries and get a plan of action thats easy to implement for the better usage of time and maximum benefits from your trip. Staff are courteous and patient.
,,Good place to start your Singapore Tour,5.0,,"We bought tickets to the hop-on, hop-off bus here, and the staff are excellent. Aside from getting a good price on the tickets (because we flew SingAir), the kids got balloons. :)"
,,Its just a tourist shop with a fancy name.,3.0,,"They would sell you stuff, give you a map, and tell you where to go; even make reservations for you; but so would one hundred other places. AND I expected to find a rest room there. No luck, they send you across the street to the Buddhist Temple."
,,Helpful,4.0,,Very good stop to start your Singapore holiday! Staff very friendly esp Joey who helped us to plan our itinerary. Well trained! Hope they had more such centers located through out the city
,,Information,5.0,,"We spoke with John, a wealth of information and gave us great tips and tricks about places to go and things to see. Great work, thanks John."
,,excellent information,5.0,,"Met with Joanna on entering centre, extremely helpful, full of knowledge and gave us lots of tips for getting around and what to see."
,,Plan your Singapore trip here!!!,5.0,,"The staff were amazingly helpful with their assistance in planning our week in Singapore. Very knowledgeable, and some items can be booked with them directly. Free wifi."
,,Good Visitor Centre very helpful,4.0,,"Went to the centre wanted to buy a prepaid card to use in my iphone to call Australia and use whilst in Singapore best way to do it instead of paying roaming high fees.Very friendly and helpful but couldnot buy one from them sent to Singtel shop where I bought Sing $30 with enough credit to call ,sms local and data.Also for restaurant guidance in Singapore a wide choice of cooking and varieties including Michelin Star local restaurant.Walk from my hotel cuscaden street to centre best way walk or taxi"
,,So helpful,5.0,,The staff were really happy to help and answer our questions. A good first stop if you're a tourist.
,,Friendly Staff,5.0,,"My husband and I called in here to ask for a map of Singapore. The lady who helped us opened the map and showed us where we were on the map, then asked where we wished to go. From there she showed us everything we needed to know on the map and also asked where we are from. She engaged us in friendly conversation and enquired about our friends who lived here. She then gave us gifts of notebooks especially produced for Singapore's 52nd birthday today. So friendly and helpful."
,,Not overly impressed,3.0,,"First time visitor to this centre, all of the information was on computers, there was very little hand out in paper form, not what I expected."
,,Very helpful place to visit when you arrive,4.0,,"The staff were extremely generous of their time and helpful in setting up wi-fi access, finding out about public transportation,locating less-known attractions and suggesting readings about the city. Thank you everyone!"
,,I wish all tourist offices were like this...,5.0,,"When you enter this place, you have a weird impression because you directly meet someone standing next to a computer who ask you what he can do for you.
Then, according to your interest, he will show you on the screen and will give you a map.
Then, he is going to give you as many infoirmation as possible.
He gave me the impression that he was more a friend trying to give you some good tips that a man doing is job.
See the litlle road next to this tourist office. I have loved the contrast with the new buildings of the avenue (Orchad road)"
,,Great place to start planning your stay in Singapore,5.0,,"Joey was extremely knowledgeable and assisted us in planning our time in Singapore. We wanted to be self sufficient and use the public transport to get around and Joey was able to provide all the information needed, Highly recommend a visit to this free service for local knowledge."
,,An interesting experience in Singapore,5.0,,"I definitely recommend the Singapore Visitor Centre on Orchard Road. The guide, Joey, was very informative and helped us plan our visit to Singapore. She also invited us to taste durian, which she was offering to all the visitors!"
,,Quite small for a place with so many attractions,3.0,,"The centre seemed to consist of 'tellers' who answered questions. They were reasonably efficient. I would have liked the opportunity to look through more brochures and perhaps see a film to get some inspiration as one has in Kuala Lumpur's Tourist Office. Emerald Hill, right behind the office, is well worth a wander."
,,Wot a great information centre !!!,5.0,,The ladies were lovely and you can make up your own itinerary to your days visiting singapore....their touch screen information was easy to use and you can print out your itinerary when finished
,,Incredibly helpful,5.0,,"great place to start the adventure. It was a little out of our way to go here, but the staff and information was well worth it."
,,Very organised and helpful,4.0,,We found them by accident but they were very helpful. They were the ones who put us onto the fact that a Singapore Airlines boarding pass can qualify you for lots of discounts
,,Food festival,5.0,,Great Mountain Cat durians! Enjoyed myself tremendously! Conveniently located in Orchard Road too! #VisitSingapore
,,Great Help!,5.0,,Trying to get information on hop on and hop off bus on line was difficult to understand. There is no clear answer on how to start your one of two day pass. Happened to be walking down orchard road and spotted the visitor centre and Jessie assisted us and explained how the hop in on off bus worked.. she said to not buy you pass in advance because if works on s 24 hour system and all you have to do is buy the ticket from the bus driver... none of the sites mention this. She also apologized that the hop on and off sites are not clearly marked at the bus stops you have to look carefully at each stop... Jessie was very pleasant and helpful!
,,For durian lovers,5.0,,"HOW SWEET IS THE SINGAPORE VISITORS CENTRE TO ALL TOURISTS WHO LOVE DURIAN.

Besides the hospitality of the staff here impressed me a lot.

Thank you to Joey who provided quality service. I can see how much she loves Singapore. She is knowledgeable and be able to give right suggestions.

Thank you."
,,Info Info Info,5.0,,This is worth a visit to map out your sightseeing. You log into a computer and see the attractions. Choose what you want to do and how...then print out. This is your own itinerary. If you need help wit staff and only too happy to help. Yes I needed help to pull my tours (yes I did three) into order. Walk out knowing where to go and how to get there. Easy.
,,Very helpful and friendly,5.0,,"As a tourist sometimes you just need a little help. We stopped into the Visitor center an they were extremely helpful. We were trying to get to Little Indian and the wheel and they helped us with maps, MRT recommendations, shopping tips, etc. The staff spoke several languages so we had no problem getting someone who spoke English."
,,Bryan Loh,5.0,,Bryan is so amazing! He helped us sort which attractions to go first based on our schedule. He was very patient in doing so without showing any hesitation. He never stoped until he made sure we were satisfied. He deserves a raise and a promotion!
,,Bryan Loh,5.0,,"A great way to start your first day in SG.
Bryan was very friendly and assisted us in planning our entire stay.
Because of so many great places to see we were so confused what to do first. Without a tour guide it is very difficult to plan the trip.
He basically planned our trip for us by giving us information about the significant places to visit.
And he is just a trainee. He should be given a permanent position because he will be a great asset to the Centre."
,,Durian experience!,5.0,,Super friendly and helpful centre: we left literally with a bagful of ideas of things to do and places to go. Highlight was the free durian tasting session! Thank you Joey for such a warm welcome!
,,Wonderful Staff,5.0,,We popped in here as we were walking by and were greated by a lovely young man who gave us great information and then we went upstairs to sample some grat traditional treats made by chef Julie. I had made a new friend by the time we left.
,,Very professional and efficient,5.0,,"Please pay this visitors center a visit, as they can tell you what is going on during your stay. Great service!"
,,The best place for information,5.0,,"We stumbled across the Singapore visitor information centre while looking at places to visit and costs etc online. Thinking it would be easier to get all the information in one place we headed down first thing in the morning to be cheerfully greeted by Lidy. She was fantastic and answered all our questions, plus gave us useful tips on how to save money as a group of four friends. Her information was spot on and we had a fantastic day out around Singapore city centre. It's a lovely building with some unique souvenirs and most importantly all the information you need while visiting."
,,FANTASTIC SERVICE,5.0,,Jay must love his work as his enthusiasm and friendliness to help recommend places to visit in Singapore was just fantastic.
,,Extremely helpful,5.0,,Would like to applaude Dennis. On our recent visit he was extremely welcoming and very helpful. He listened to our enquiry and was able to show us alternative (and cheaper) ways to seeing what we wanted to see.
,,Awesome advice,5.0,,"After getting very confused and frustrated at trying to plan and book our day went and saw Jay at the info centre, he was brilliant. Explained the MRT and how to get to it highlighted on our map where the things we wanted to see where and how to get there with times of shows. Came away feeling encouraged and positive, had a great day.
Well worth a visit, thanks Jay"
,,Good idea to stop there,5.0,,"Very informative, it was a good idea to stop there. They suggested to us a good walk and to discover Singapore and gave us different tips."
,,Helpful Stop,5.0,,"Been to Singapore several times, but decided to stop by and ask about newer attractions. Staff was extremely helpful."
,,Singapore Visitors Welcomed!!,5.0,,"On our first day in beautiful Singapore we decided to take on the mighty Orchard Road with its beautiful boutiques and enormous shopping malls. While it didn't disappoint, the highlight of the day was definitely the Singapore Visitor Centre. We stopped in for a quick visit and instead we were treated to delicious taste testing of local treats, ice waters and an exciting example of local architectural marvels made miniature to delight the young and old alike. If you're lucky enough to find yourself in this amazing city the Singapore Visitor Centre is a must. We can't thank the beautiful Joey and Jilly enough for their warm welcome. Their Singaporean hospitality is second to none!!"
,,Fascinating Heritage,5.0,,"Just by chance we found ourselves outside the Singapore Visitor Centre on Orchard Road and wandered inside. (The air conditioning was beckoning too.) All the staff are very friendly, helpful and supply great maps and information.
The highlight for us (2 families of 4, including 3 teenage girls and a 12 yr old boy) was when one of the amazing staff invited upstairs to try our hand at beading and told us about traditional Peranakan Chinese beadwork, which was a suitable pass time for ladies in the past.
The original and colourful Peranakan houses in the street around the corner from the Visitor Centre are such a contrast to modern & busy Orchard Road.
The Visitor Centre was a very memorable and unexpected encounter!"
,,GO HERE FIRST,5.0,,"We picked up a map at Changi airport and, extraordinarily, it did not show the Visitor Centre. Whoever put out the map is not acting in the best interests of tourists or tourism in Singapore.

We didn't find the Centre until toward the end of our stay while wandering Orchard Avenue. There was so much information available, and the staff eager to be helpful.

Next to the Centre is Emerald Hill, a long street of restored chop houses. Walk the length of the street for a look at old Singapore .... although now very tidy and well maintained."
,,Great advice from knowledgeable locals,5.0,,we dropped in seeking advice on where to go and what to see. Staff were brilliant. They assisted in tailoring a series of activities that suited our interests. Also provide travel and ticketing advice without any hard sell. Even pointed out the discounts we could get at various locations. Combine a visit with a walk down Orchard Road and make the most out of your Singapore visit.
,,Very helpful staff!,5.0,,"If you want to know anything about Singapore, come to this place. The staff member who talked to us was very helpful. We had just moved to Singapore and this person gaves us all sorts of advice ranging from catching the MRT and buses, things to look out when choosing an apartment, and how to enjoy Singapore on a budget. Keep up the great work!"
,,Great technology,5.0,,"Its awesome. A friendly guide will show you how to look through the catalogue of attractions on their computer, then you can plan the days and it will print a personalised itinerary and map with helpful hints about public transport and nearby attractions. It's really cool"
,,Visit to guarantee you a wonderful Singapore Experience,5.0,,"This is the 2nd time i've visited the Singapore Visitor Centre, (a year apart), and both times I've received fantastic personalised service. The staff here are great to highlight areas of Singapore that would be of interest to you and how to make the most of your time here. Well worth stopping by when your first arrive so they can help you plan as best as possible! I imagine even if you were a local they could advise some good spots to head to that you may never have experienced!

John helped me, and gave ideas for new places to see and visit in Singapore. He was very friendly, approachable, knowledgable and lovely to chat to. I'm now excited for the rest of my visit and what I will see in Singapore! Thank you John & all the team :)"
,,Jody is exceptional!,5.0,,Graet service and super helpful service. Really appreciated Jody's help and she's set us up for an amazing trip :)
,,Great location for all.,5.0,,"I visited the centre in June 2017. We were met by Stephen Wang who was so friendly and helpful. He did as Shuanang had said and revamped my attempt at an itinerary then printed it out.
He also gave us advice on the MRT which was invaluable. What an easy system to use and always on time.
Thanks to Stephen and all the staff we had an amazing holiday in Singapore."
,,Good for locals & tourists alike!,5.0,,"This place is suitable for locals and tourists alike! Multiple dedicated & friendly service staff are available to answer all of your queries, from directions to attractions and hotels & suggesting itineraries based on your wants. If you're feeling like doing up itineraries yourself, there are multiple computers with a easy to use touchscreen - with a comprehensive list of things to do, see and eat. Once you've done up the itinerary, the service staff will help you print out a A3 sized paper which they'll fold nicely for you into a pocket sized map/MRT line/your list of itineraries with their contact details as a nice souvenir to take home.
Upstairs, they also run Hari Raya activities from 1030am-130pm until the 25th June.
In my experience, Joey personalised my experience & recommended me to visit the Peranakan museum based on my needs - and I was surely intrigued by the suggestion with her humorous touch.
Tourists, VISIT THIS PLACE FIRST.
Locals, come here and discover this feature-rich place and get to know more about your own country!"
,,Really helpful people,5.0,,"Helpful people, happily entertained the kids while we were organising information / directions. They also have a tour desk operator in there who can book and confirm tours on the spot. Convienient location at the MRT station."
,,Excellent!,5.0,,"We got expert help from Stephen regarding several places to visit in Singapore, and how to get around easily with a refillable mrt/bus card."
,,Very informative and helpful,4.0,,The lovely Joey was there to help us get oriented on our first walk around Singapore. Really great way to get started in Singapore.
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Thank you Lidy and Joanna for all your info. This place is so informative and will save you money. There are things you'll miss if you don't visit early on of your stay in Singapore, can't recommend this enough. They have free events, we watched Chinese dumplings being made with free tasters (yummy), told us if the free 2 hour tour of china town with free water and taster at end. Maps and leaflets very useful."
,,Top rate service!,4.0,,Visited the information centre on our 2nd day in Singapore just to speak to someone about some of the places we would like to visit and whether there were other things worth doing. We were welcomed by a very knowledgeable gentleman who spoke to us at length about the myriad of experiences we could have. He then introduced us to their interactive computer which enabled us to plan our days and print off the details of these sights. We were really very impressed with the service. I would like to add though that the actual building and space occupied by the Information Centre was very small and unimpressive and had a quite poor retail/souvenir section. But as far as service was concerned it was top rate! It was also lovely and cool inside!
,,Try not to go at night.,3.0,,"I recently dropped by with my friend, who had wanted to collect some brochures and purchase some last-minute souvenirs. We were also thinking of some last-minute places to go before my friend leaves tomorrow. I guess the visitor experiences wanes with opening hours.

The selection of brochures is relatively limited; as with the assortment of souvenirs available. Do note that the souvenirs here are marked up from their original retail price.

We were then approached by this staff member, who came up to strike a conversation with us. The conversation started off friendly. Instead of introducing us to more places to go in Singapore, she began to talk about her own wonderful adventures in China and Hong Kong - and how much she loved being there. It felt awkwardly strange how the topic never came back to Singapore and what are some suggested places we can head to before the evening flight back. The whole experience felt to me like she just wanted to brag to us how much she knew about China and Hong Kong. We totally preferred if she could introduce to us places in Singapore that perhaps even the locals would have missed out on. The experience was distasteful, and we dropped the idea of getting our souvenirs there.

For brochures, visitors can go to various places to get them. The airport is the safest bet - I usually collect them for my overseas friends there. The museums in Singapore have way more selection too - both the National Gallery and the Asian Civilisations Museum are recommended. The National Museum of Singapore runs out of brochures very quickly."
,,Lots of surprises entails !,5.0,,"Brought a friend who came from Australia here since she would like to bring some brochures home for her mates who are heading over in the next couple of months. I must say I was wowed by the services rendered by Joey - she is helpful and informative! she even gave many suggestions on what to-do etc.. tourists are able to select what the places of interest based on the recommendations and print the itinerary using the system provided. Travelling is never made so easy ! Furthermore, on the 2nd floor it showcase a preview of Singapore Icons and there are activities provided periodically. We just missed the making of dumplings (May) so maybe we can look forward to the next.

There are actually in fact alot of things that I myself was not even aware of... It is really worth a visit, for tourists and locals alike."
,,Disappointing,3.0,,"We stopped by the Singapore Visitor Centre at the start of our trip for a better quality map. The staff weren't that helpful and we had read that they had a great souvenir section that didn't sell the usual mass produced rubbish. There wasn't much to choose from in the souvenirs, they did have a few nice things though. It would be great if they could increase the product range. Singapore is such an amazing city to visit, however we felt they could do a much better job at this centre."
,,"Very helpful and informative, I like the cooking demonstration they had.",5.0,,"Good food, learned the technique of steaming rice as a delicacy and dessert. The staff showed us around."
,,Super satisfied,5.0,,"They are very helpful, every questions i asked they answered t very polite and resourceful. He even help me to find our the last MRT available to go to the airport from somerset station."
,,pickup your Hop On Hop Off Tickets here,4.0,,Took a 48 hr tour for S$49/- each. On 7 different lines really good deal. You can get your Sim Card here too. Book all your tours from this location. The Hop On Hop Off stops outside their door.
,,sticky rice,5.0,,"Brilliant the ladies were wonderful,as was the sticky rice will go again in october worth a visit ,,,,"
,,They know it all,4.0,,They will help you with everything and they have maps and information even on the smaller places you have never heard about - the staff are young and to be found behind the smartphones :-)

,,Great service,5.0,,"I stepped into Singapore visitor centre to ask for directions and was welcomed by Jessie with a smile and offer of ideas about exploring this metropolis. Friendly service with a smile, thanks Jessie. Highly recommended."
,,Tourist and Demographic Info.,5.0,,All staff very friendly and knowledgeable about all things Singapore. Hands on rice dumplings were made and sampled along with jasmine tea. Worth the stop to get accuanted with sight seeing options.

She helped find Lau Pa Sat market or Telok Ayer Market. I had been there 25 years ago when it was much different experience. It was then a vibrant festive marketplace. However today it is quite worn from those long ago days. I am so happy that Joey was so helpful to research and bring to a place I visited a long time ago. She is a true gem and the Visitor Centre is a must stop when you are on Orchard Road.
,,Should be your first stop upon visit,5.0,,"If you haven't figured out what to see and what to avoid on your trip to singapore, or most importantly how to save a little of your hard earned money on this trip, dont get into the trouble of booking through iventure or viator online. Just visit the singapore visitor centre on your first day of the trip and collect as many flyers as you can. Seek help from their staff in sorting out your itenary and start off right away.

Suggestions so original and helpful and unusual that we will be busy for days on end. Thanks, Joey, and thanks for your help. And fellow visitors, I really can't recommend enough a stop here before beginning your daily assigned visits! The most unusual suggestion which we followed up? Stopping in at the Singapore Public Library's Orchard Street branch across the street from the Center...a spectacular look into the future of public libraries in first world countries."

,,All you need in one place.,5.0,,"The Information Centre is well equipped and the staff are extremely well trained, all you need to know about Singapore is here and readily available.

,,"I could have given it 4 star,",3.0,,"The female who assisted us a bit abrupt, not the friendly warm person you would imagine working at the Visitor centre.

,,"Not a tourist attraction in it's own right, but useful for guidance",4.0,,What to say? It's a place to get information about Singapore. The staff are friendly and speak English. I approached them with questions concerning the local Singtel card I had purchased for my mobile phone and they send me to Singtel! Very pragmatic if not helpful in it's own right.
,,So helpful,5.0,,We went in here on our first day in Singapore to get a map. The young gentleman who served us was extremely helpful and marked all the must see places on the map for us and showed us some of the places on the inter active screen they had there. Would recommend going here.
,,A wonderful introduction to a great holiday,5.0,,"We had done some research through the Singapore guide books to identify what we should see during our 10 days in Singapore and while the books are good, we really needed expert local knowledge to fine tune those, maybe drop some things from the list and add others not referred in the books. And that's exactly what John Lee, one of the excellent staff at the Orchard Road visitor centre was able to do for us. Even just to walk into the Centre and have people coming forward to greet you was really nice but then to have about 45 minutes of John's knowledge (complemented by his friendly personality) meant that when we walked out of the Centre we had a clear plan for the next 10 days. And the plan worked. So, particularly if you are new to Singapore go to the Visitor Centre first thing on your for first day and you'll find it's a high quality investment of time which will reap great benefits. Oh.....and ask for John Lee!"
,,Excellent one to one attention...,5.0,,"...but don't go in for leaflets as the selection is poor. Unfortunately we went in for the latter for some visitors we are expecting. This is the perfect place if you are looking for information or wanting to book a visit to an attraction, but not for information for third parties.

Take a wander up the road nest to the centre to see some excellent shop houses (Emerald Hill Road)"
,,Excellent Concierge,5.0,,"Regardless of whether or not you are a tourist, the staff inside will always be willing to help you. I have went in twice for directions, and they were able to give advice instantly! If you are in the area and need recommendations, do visit!"

Many thanks once again from us both. keep up with the passion!"

Coming to a new city for a short time can be over whelming cramming everything in however Joanna helped us plan our trip and it feels like we've been here a week rather than two days with how much we saw and done.

She gave us invaluable advice about where to eat and how to get our monies worth.

Our Singaporean friend suggested this place and we complied. I honestly didn't expect much from a tourist centre but we went in anyway. The place is bright, welcoming, and as expected, filled with maps and souvenir items. We were greeted by Joey who enthusiastically invited us to explore the place and look at items on display. She even handed us free bags! :) She also invited us upstairs to try the VR tour of Singapore. This place is memorable to me because of Joey's heartwarming hospitality and the people I was with that night. Hope Joey reads this!"

The questions i had could not be answered by the lady but she did endevour to find out for me , though still didnt get the questions answered completely she did make an effort. Other people in there helping with tours etc, so good place to go if you are looking for tips, maybe if you are on a short stay. Best thing they had the Air con really cranked up !"
,,There is so much to see and do in Singapore - but you need to plan it!,5.0,,"We can not recommend the Singapore Visitor Centre, and more particularly Liddy - for their assistance in mapping out our Singapore adventure.

The risk with arranging such trips on the internet and using the likes of Air BnB etc is that you are no longer afforded much assistance in planning your trip as was done previously via travel agents and hotel Concierge's.

You need to be planned or you miss out on things - or pay too much. Liddy at the Singapore Visitor Centre worked with us on identifying our wants and needs and then planned out our itinerary. Liddy then offered us suggestions to available packages and we chose accordingly. As it turned out, the 5 day sight seeing pass was ideal for us. We had the time and we saw all that was offered in the package and saved loads. Thanks Liddy"

I ""stumbled"" across the visitor centre and unlike me I walked in. The staff were great, helpful and informative, and I hadn't appreciated there was so much to do and see.
Whether it's your first time or like me a regular visitor I would certainly recommend a stop at the centre and ""tap into"" the ideas and suggestions of the staff. I've been twice so far, Joey and the chap yesterday (didn't take his name) were very helpful."

,,Very helpful information for tourists,5.0,,"I went to this Orchard Road Visitor Centre late in the day on my first day to Singapore. I had already been to the Chinatown Visitor Center that morning, and I must say my experience was far better at the Orchard Road location! At Chinatown, I only felt like they were trying to sell me things, but at Orchard Road, the staff were so welcoming and friendly, and they helped me get the information I needed. They have these kiosks where you can select the locations you are interested in seeing, and you can put different activites on different days of your itinerary. Then they print off this map for you, and you can carry this convenient summary of the activities you want to do. A woman named Sheila helped me when I visited, and she was great! I definitely recommend stopping by here early in your visit to Singapore."

What a fresh breathe of air she was, she helped us with tours using her knowledge of what was available and once we engaged in a conversation guided us to what we were looking for; helping to coordinate days of the various walking tours available to our schedule. We also were given details on a choice of where we could celebrate our 30th Wedding Anniversary. Joey took the time to show us through photos, menu's and personal recommendations. We followed her advice and had the most amazing evening dining at the Equinox Restaurant. After our meal we went to thank her and she was very excited but also extremely humble. Her sense of fun and warmth really made us realise what an asset she is not only to the Visitor Centre but also to the Singapore tourist industry. Thank you, we will be back again!"

,,Went in with no expectations - came out impressed!,5.0,,"Usually visitor centers are a tourist trap or a room full of stressed out people trying to help. Having been away from Singapore for quite some time, and curious about the nice building and great reviews, we decided to go into take a look. There is a 2nd floor with exhibits that are informative, and interesting, even for a Singaporean who has been away for some time (Eg. did you know HDB flats are built to take advantage of the breeze and avoid the sun?). What was outstanding was the staff, super friendly, so helpful, full of information. One particular ""uncle"" - John, patiently spent time with our 3 kids, giving them a history of the country, how we are water independent now - knowing our backgrounds, he gave us great suggestions on places which were new (eg. national gallery), as well as interesting places to visit to update us (and educate the kids). This is how tourist centers should be - if you are visiting Singapore, even if you have done all your research - do pay these friendly people a visit, they are warm, helpful and full of information - well worth the effort - they are just a minute away from Somerset MRT, you can't miss them. Thumbs up!"
,,Lots of tips,5.0,,"There was a very nice persone, Joey.She gave me lots of ideas.All of them were very useful.Thanks so much!!!"
,,Very helpful,5.0,,"Not being in Singapore for about 16 years a lot has changed suffice to say.

Decided to pop in and seek some guidance. We spoke to John Lee who was extremely helpful and good banter as well! He took his time with us, answered all of our questions and gave us a good insight into the best ways to plan all of our routes and the costs involved within our itinerary. The Singapore MRT is a fantastic service.

Our trip is sadly coming to an end, but John's information has been invaluable throughout our trip and we really much appreciated it!

Thanks and all the best.

Until the next time!"
,,Over the Top helpful!,5.0,,"Joey was so enthusiastic that I am sure she was disappointed that we only had one afternoon to see the sights. Clearly, she loves Singapore and wants everyone who visits to see all that it has to offer. Start your trip with a visit here!"
,,"Warm, Friendly and Helpful",5.0,,"I poked my head into the visitor center yesterday whilst pondering around Orchard Road just to pick up some brochures when a kind warm voice asked if I would like some help. I have just moved to Singapore from the Netherlands and am eager to immerse myself into a new life here. Joey had a really calming and soothing presence which made me feel at ease to ask her a number of obscure questions about furniture shopping, how to get to Ikea via public transport etc. Joey was beyond helpful. Afterwards, she invited me to relax on some cushions and use the wifi so I could contact my boyfriend about the urgent matter of finding our home. Thank you for making me feel at home already Joey, it meant a lot.
Chloe"

,,Brilliant touch screens to save you time and hassle.,5.0,,"This Visitor Centre was open until late at night which was such a bonus when we chanced upon it.

They have brilliant touch screens showing places to visit. You can touch on them to view all the information you could need, address, opening hours, costs, directions, buses and trains etc. What was the absolute most useful thing however was that you could tell it to add it to an itinerary and then print it out at the end. This was massively useful. We found interesting things to see that we didn't know existed such as Baba House.

I would recommend looking through the touch screens yourself, once you have decided on things that interest you, you may wish to ask the Staff to help place them into an itinerary as they had the knowledge and ability to quickly and easily bunch things together by location, so that you really had a streamlined personal itinerary with all the information you could need. They were really helpful in this regard and wanted to share their knowledge with you.

Do yourself a favour and wander in here, you will be really pleasantly surprised at the usefulness and easy to use nature of these screens. In fact I wish Trip Advisor had this ability as it was so helpful."
