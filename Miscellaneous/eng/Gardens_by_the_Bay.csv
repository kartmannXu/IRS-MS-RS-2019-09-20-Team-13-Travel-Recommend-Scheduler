,,"Unique experience, beautiful gardens.",5,,"I really enjoyed a long stroll through the Singapore Gardens by the Bay. Gardens is an understatement, it鈥檚 gardens, monuments, unique trees, rein forest under a dome and much more. The artificial flower towers are amazing. I really enjoyed the huge Rain Forest and Flower Dome museums. Not sure if museum is the right word to describe them. The Cloud (rain) forest is a real rain forest under a huge dome. Inside, 6 or more floors high, you enjoy a walk thru a huge variety of rain forest vegetation including amazing flowers, trees, greens and moss. The orchid garden is amazing and orchids and a variety of other unique and beautiful flowers are everywhere. In the flower dome, one can see every type of cactus and baobab tree imaginable and flower and greens gardens from every corner of the world. I really enjoyed the cactus and baobab collections. Never seen anything like this in any botanical garden around the world.",,
,,Re discovering Singapore la !,5,,"My husband and I visited Singapore after 18 years... .that s quite a while . So truly it was an exciting 3 days discovering the new spots in this city state . Gardens by the Bay with the sound and light show is spectacular And I am being master of the art of understatement when I say this !! .The show had us all reverted .

There are lots of cafes and restaurants around .There is a great touristy buzz around the area A must visit in Singapore
An artistic tech show .",,
,,Interesting light show,4,,"Interesting light show , worth seeing, but lots of people, go early , see in daytime and wait for show",,
,,Beautiful and free (price-wise)!!!!,4,,"Take a camera, you won't be disappointed. The walk back to Bayfront MRT station is a lengthy one so take some water.",,
,,A must place to Visit in SG,4,,"This is the place where i keep on coming everytime i go to singapore. However you may want to check the ""current"" season in The flower dome before you decided to purchase the ticket.. So far I've Enjoyed Tulips the most.
Suggest that you come later in the evening when the weather is not so hot as the flower dome can be a bit too hot under the blazing sun (its a glass house afterall :P).

Once you've completed touring The flower dome and the cloud forest, you may purchace the skybridge ticket nearing sunset time and enjoy the sunset view of marina bay sands and the SupertreeGrove.",,
,,Light Show,5,,This place is amazing to go at least once and check out the flowers and please do not miss the light show at the end. It definitely worth it.,,
,,Our family loved it,5,,Beautiful place. We brought tickets for the both domes. All I can say is you will thoroughly enjoy both domes. Plants from all over the world and they are so celebrating Christmas. The cloud dome has an amazing waterfall in It. We saw the gardeners abseiling down to plant plants and do weeding. Orchids were beautiful and so well kept.,,
,,Gardens by the Bay in Christmas mood,5,,Amazing light performance during Christmas season with a Christmas market full of dining options and a surprise at the end of the show!,,
,,Don't need half a day here,4,,"Great experience and glad we visited. definitely spectacular!
Very cold inside so be prepared. Didnt need half a day here as most people told us. We went through at a casual pace taking lots of photos in about 2 hours.
We went onto the cloud gardens after and that was another an hour at least.
No good coffee places here for lactose intolerant folk like myself. Disappointing after i needed a coffee after walking around for hours and freezing cold hahaha Oh well. minor complaint. Worth a visit overall and good value considering the maintenance costs they would have on such a place.",,
,,Amazing Garden Rhapsody Show,5,,"This is a must go spot if you are in Singapore! I highly recommend to go in the later afternoon to visit the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest (both are amazing with different features) and then in the evening, stay to catch Garden Light show at the Super Trees area!",,
,,Great and educational,5,,Perfect to visit while in Singapore. Many different varieties from around the world. A don't miss activity.,,
,,Amazing place,5,,Beautifully managed and cared for. Massive area to view and a good half day visit to see the main attractions.,,
,,Fantastic must see place,5,,"This is a wonderful place. The gardens are spectacular and the indoor gardens and the giant waterfall are incredible. Just visit it, you will not be disappointed",,
,,A must see in Singapore,5,,"We have been staying a couple of nights in Singapore before we board my husbands 50th Cruise to Bali and then Sydney.
We spent half a day exploring this amazing place yesterday.
It is a must see it is hard to believe that it is man made!
The Cloud Forrest was my favourite as we could have spent all day in there.
Tip - If you feel the cold take a jacket as the temp is quiet cold inside due to the air conditioning and waterfalls etc.

Earths new man made Garden of Eden!!

:)",,
,,Amazing experience,5,,A must see experience. The light show was great. We went on a tour to the gardens and Mariner Sands hotel.,,
,,A must visit site especially in the evening for the light show,5,,"A fantastic place to visit, fantastic evening light and music show at the cloud gardens, lovely park and really good indoor gardens that are well worth a visit",,
,,Amazing Experience,5,,"Visited both domes & the sky walk, the variety of species was amazing & all were clearly named & described.Definitely a not to be missed experience when in Singapoer",,
,,Must visit,5,,"Caught a bus to the gates from the hotel, rail may have been cooler, the day was hot and humid with rain forecast. As the two ""main"" areas were inside the rain wasn't an issue, however, if you have a head for heights don't miss the aerial walkway between the artificial trees. The path is very stable so if you can handle the height but not the swaying, you should be good with this. There is an additional cost for this but it is well worth the small expense. The Cloud Forest was my pick of the two indoor areas purely because of the waterfall; I am not saying either display was better than the other, I just like waterfalls. Outside you have larger and more robust (?) specimens, just as much colour, birds, bugs and lizards as an added bonus. We exited across the walkway to the Marina Sands having a birdseye view of the lakes and fountains.
Expect your camera to fog up so take the necessary wipes and pack your macro lens !!!",,
,,Amazing!,5,,"What a fabulous city with so much to see and do. With only a day and night there, my son and I crammed in as much as we could with a trip to see The Supertrees light show, drinks from the roof top bar and an amazing meal on top of the Marina Bay Hotel. We walked round the Cloud Forest and The Flower Dome and were blown away by the variety of plants and the spectacular setting. The whole experience was magical and I will definitely visit the city again. I highly recommend it.",,
,,Probably better to go during the day,3,,"We went to this attraction because it sounded so pretty at night with all the lights. And it was - but, you should also be aware that it is too dark to actually read all the placards about the plants, and many of the plants aren't well-lit, so although it is dramatic, it's not a great experience. My guess is that we would have enjoyed it more if we had gone during the day. It was also super crowded, but that may have been due to the Christmas displays. There were limited options for food, as well, partially because one restaurant was closed for a private party.",,
,,Plants Your,5,,The volunteers have given us a great overview of Garden by the bay and we are more aware of the trees and flowers planted in the garden. Good and very informative tour.,,
,,Oustanding,5,,This is a must do when you are in the city. It is a stunning experteince. Do not forget to back at night for the light show.,,
,,Worth a Visit,4,,"It has three main attractions close by i.e cloud forest, flower dome and super tree structures. one can visit all three in 3-4 hours. best time is late afternoon finishing with gardens by the bay light show. Close to MRT station. One can also walk through Marina bay sands hotel.",,
,,Worth for visit,4,,"Great experience to know more species of plant and flower in this era. Walk close to nature in cool air, it's really amazing esp in this only summer country. An awesome place must bring families and friends esp festive season.",,
,,A Must Visit whether Locals or Tourists!,5,,"I have been there twice so far and both the Flower Dome and The Cloud Forest are
amazing. Go first thing in the morning to avoid the crowds. Check online to see what special exhibits they have. The Gardens bring in Cherry Blossoms, Tulips, Sunflowers during different seasons. This is one place where you can see the different types of plants and flowers under one roof without being exposed to the hot sun and insect bites.",,
,,Amazing place for families and folliage fans,5,,"We live in Singapore (my wife, 2 yr old daughter and I) and we regularly visit the gardens. There are lots of nice walks, a water park, rainforest cloud dome, cycle and walk paths, otter spotting, Satay by the bay for food and lots more. We like to go in the evenings for the light show especially when visitors are here. This pic is from the Winter Wonderland at Christmas which is always worth the visit. Be prepared for big crowds at the weekends though.",,
,,For MICE,5,,"A really grea5 place with a natural surrounding within a modern structure . Here every plant is cared for by a hardwirking team , also themes kept on being added as per flavour of the season .",,
,,Winter wonderland at the bayfront,5,,"This is the first time the organisation hold the Christmas lighting at the bay with mini food stall and souvenir stalls along the park within the premises, viewers have to purchase entry ticket for entering to take photographs and spending times with friends and families, besides that is to enjoyed the cooling breeze and walking around the plant which is growing attached to the giant piller with light shine on it.",,
,,Cannot get enough,5,,"If you like flower and plantTion and hate sun, this is the best place for you.

You have fo check what they are having for the seasonal/ thematic plant, for example they have orchid garden, or tulip fest.

You might walk a lot but the flower dome itself is not too big :(.",,
,,In awe of the colours,5,,"Wow what an experience. The size of the dome and the layout. The planting season and created scenes were amazing. Go just before dark so you get to see the gardens light up. The colour shows are a beauty, but then so is much of Singapore.",,
,,Worth your time & money,5,,A fantastic area to explore for the young & old. If you love nature & flora then look no further. Passengers whom arrive via Singapore Airlines or SilkAir also get 10% off their entry ticket when they present their boarding pass stubb so don't forget to show that!,,
,,A sense of peace shrouded by greenery...,5,,"A wonderful sanctuary in the midst of concrete skyscrapers! If you love nature and greenery, you don't have to travel far to be close to nature... I spotted the occasional surprise of iguana passing my path with amazement... Good spot for picture taking and enjoying some idyllic landscapes and fresh air :>",,
,,Spectacular gardens,5,,"Even if you're not a gardener, you can't help but be impressed by the Gardens by the Bay. It's equally brilliant late afternoon/early evening, with a fantastic light show on nightfall. The walk above the ground before the light show is definitely well worthwhile; be early to avoid the queues trying to access the elevated walk. It is within easy reach of the MRT.",,
,,Enchanting city garden,4,,"This place fuses nature and man made garden into one amazing place. There are plenty of plants and flowers to admire, while the gigantic and iconic artificial Super Trees, provide a sense of grandeur as they tower above the garden. The indoor gardens are a must to visit, and there is one of the world's largest indoor waterfalls located inside.",,
,,Great place!,5,,"Amazing garden! The show at night is really cool! You will find a vast amount of plant species and different areas to explore! Solo, family or couples travel this is a must! Visit the domes if you can too!",,
,,Definitely worth to see,5,,"Given that most of sightseeing places in Singapore are man-made, this one is ranked the top to see. Free entrance for just roaming around and also light-sound shows at night.
Best to go earlier to get good spot for lying down and chilling during the shows.",,
,,Well designed,4,,"Yes, it is man-made. Still, it is really well made!
It is not my first time, I brought family over. I remain impressed at how well designed and thought through this place was.
To maintain a climate that accommodates different plants from different parts of the world, with nice art-works. My sister, who is a botanist by training and loves plants, was impressed and even said that it was better than the one in London (which I haven't been to). If she says it's nice, then it means it's nice! I trust her!",,
,,Christmas Wonderland,4,,"Gardens by the Bay is few minutes walk from Bay Front MRT.
Now Christmas Wonderland lighting and festive market is there.
Go in the evening to see the lighting. In the evening with the lighting, festive market, variety of food it is a nice place to spend few hours.
Children will love the atmosphere.
Tickets are available online and at the venue.",,
,,Very beautiful but too much walk.,4,,"Its a man made marvel standing in the middle of the city.Well managed, clean and worth going.The condition in which they keep exotic flowers is commendable,I enjoyed cloud dome more as I am not flower person(it was also very beautiful though).Light and sound show happens in the evening around 7to8 pm for 15 mins, must watch.

Only thing missing was amenities for old people who cannot walk.While coming back towards MRT,there is no place to sit.Hope they do something about it.",,
,,Garden by the bay,4,,"It was great experience and quite a variety there but bit expensive, I believe it is targeting only limited visitors",,
,,Gardens By The Bay,4,,"Very beautiful, huge and clean garden. Recommended for visit from evening unless you love the Sun, Ensure to bring your camera along to capture the nice views and you may get to catch the OTTERS in group. A very convenient garden that is linked through Marina Bay Sands. Reach there by SMRT or Taxis and there is a local food centre but it is tourist pricing. Stay late to catch the night lasers show. Wear light and comfy walking shoe and umbrella (if it is rainy season).",,
,,Great Attraction for Family with Young Children,5,,This a great attraction for families and friends. It's a huge place a involves a lot of walking which is also good for your health. It has attraction for additional price. There is also a water park where kids can enjoy and play around.,,
,,Massive place,4,,"Not the first time I visited the place. A relaxed walk in the middle of a global forest where all the region of the world are enclosed. The air conditioning helps a lot, someone won't go out after the visit. Suggesting to go around lunchtime, maybe after a visit to the Data By The Bay food court which it is located closely. No crowded at that time.",,
,,Giant glass house,5,,"What can I say, went to Singapore numerous time but only now I decided to go to Garden By The Bay.
Because they have The Christmas Wonderland Illumination and Tsum Tsum
The illumination and tsum tsum were so so, I was more impressed with the scale of the plants and arrangement along with the magnificent architecture.

So it really worth the queueing.",,
,,Beautiful,4,,"We visited the christmas wonderland. There is an entrance fee. It was decorated & lighted up. Plan ahead..its extremely crowded on weekends. There is even a dazzling show of lights & songs. There was a choir group singing carols. Behind a digital screen ""the christmas grotto""..there is free photography with santa.",,
,,A Must Do!,5,,"The Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are two very unique conservatories. Though they are open till 9pm, we couldn't take nice pictures without daylight. The Flower Dome has a very upscale club.

The Supertree Tree Grove has a light show at 7.45pm and 8.45pm. Not to be missed is the OCBC Skyway which allows us to walk among the Supertrees.

Satay by the Bay has delicious local food only a 10 min walk from the domes. Affordable too.",,
,,Garden by the bay,5,,Good location Easy to locate Entry is free Beautiful scenery Clean and green Excellent staff service,,
,,Spectacular man made nature reserve,5,,"I visited this place in September with my girlfriend. Not being a fan of flowers, I went with an open mind.

I was pleasantly surprised when we got there. Although it was crowded, there was sufficient space for people to observe and take in the beauty of the displays. There were sculptures incorporated into the floral displays, such that some of the flowers were wrapped around these sculptures, or actually were ""molded"" into sculptures.

Being a local, I highly recommend Gardens by the Bay for people of all walks of life. It is truly a worthwhile attraction, considering that Singapore's becoming increasingly ""concrete"".",,
,,Amazing garden,4,,"This place offer greenery with amazement. It have flower, plant and tree like no other place. Good place to take a picture due to the colourful scenery.",,
,,Delightful day/night,5,,The garden's are visually stunning. I would recommend a afternoon then stay for the night show with the giant tree's just a delightful experience. You can buy drinks ice cream food. Toilets are very clean. The show starts when sunset has happened. If you would like to have the best position then you can buy a ticket and stand on the bridges between the tree's. Or just look up to the sky for free. Plenty to see or just enjoy the walk. There are designated smoking areas however not many.,,
,,Absolutely stunning,5,,"So relaxing and beautifully made garden. Definitely visit when in Singapore, U can either go to one or both dome..",,
,,Light up trees,5,,Awesome. Everyone should go - but go at night. The sound and light show is excellent. Long queues for the walkway though,,
,,Gardens By the Bay,4,,"Brilliant environment, amazing tree structures, wonderfully maintained. Good food joints, excellent greenery",,
,,Day visit,5,,"We arrived at this beautiful exotic place with the most wonderful gorgeous plants arranged so artisticly. We spent a whole afternoon and evening there as you can wander around at your own pace with so many interesting things to see and be amazed. There is so much to see and enjoy, it鈥檚 a must to visit.",,
,,Nice creativity,4,,"Light show was gud in the view of Marian Bay sand, different types colored lights dancing to music, must see place, daily two shows available i think",,
,,Gardens by the bay,5,,A wonderful place filled with modern beauty. The only downside is it's quite expensive. The perfect timing to visit the garden is around 5 pm to 9 pm which allows you to catch the night view as well as the view in broad sunlight,,
,,the two domes,5,,"it is worth visiting the two domes, take your time and enjoy all floors, the second dome is in my opinion more interesting then the first. the waterfall is nice to visit.Good to be there before the light show starts at night. The show is amazing and the music is good. Keep in mind that the taxi lines are extremely long, it can take up to one hour to get a cab from the event. Good idea is to leave the light show a little bit early and make it to the taxis, could be worth it.",,
,,Quite remarkable,5,,This is definitely one of Singapore's MUST visits. Anyone with a fear of heights might find it a tad challenging!,,
,,Great for all ages!,5,,The gardens by the bay were awesome! We did both bio domes and then the large tree top walk. Beautiful flowers and other plant life! Great for any age!,,
,,A must !,4,,"The Gardens by the Bay is a must-do attraction for anyone visiting Singapore. Although man-made, it is particularly well done and the domes (flower dome and cloud forest) are spectacular.",,
,,A must !,4,,"The Gardens by the Bay is a must-do attraction for anyone visiting Singapore. Although man-made, it is particularly well done and the domes (flower dome and cloud forest) are spectacular.",,
,,Out of this world,5,,"From the moment you step into the gardens, whether day or night this place was just amazing. The creative works with the attention to detail just makes this place a must return to visit.",,
,,Loved it,5,,We spent a morning here. Was lovely to see the gardens in the domes helped that they were lovely and cool inside too. We did return on another evening to see the light show.,,
,,Still enjoy to go there !!,4,,"Everytime I am Singapore, I enjoy to go there and to see the evolution on the gardens and the plants growing on the metal trees.
This time again a lot of pleasure to visit it.
Unfortunately, long queue !!! and a request to limit to 15 minutes the visit!!!",,
,,Pretty,4,,Nice wandering around the gardens. Lovely smells of different flowers. We went on the high walk which had amazing views. Also enjoyed a beer and snack in the bar outside.,,
,,A Wonderful Garden in the City,4,,"This is my second visit to Gardens by the Bay, I like the beautiful landscapes and many greenery and flowers around. You can see different kinds of flowers on display, they change accordingly, example in December is the Christmas theme ! Especially I like the aircon domes where you can walk and admire the flowers and plants without the sun shinning on you...very refreshing and comfortable. The location is very convenient, you just take the MRT to Bayfront station and walk there (within 15 minutes) and sheltered all the way. You can stay there till the night and is very beautiful with the lightings. A place which I will visit whenever I have the time.",,
,,"Incredible, not to be missed.",5,,"This was the highlight of our visit to Singapore.

The gardens are free with an incredible variety of plants, sights.

We visited both the Cloud and Flower Domes.

Entry price for each adult was 14 SD (~$10 USD).

We paid separately as the Cloud Dome was closed for maintenance on our first day.

Closure dates are listed on the GBTB website.

The Flower Dome was our favorite.

Incredible displays which were well designed.

We spent 2+ hours in the AM, came back in the afternoon (make sure to get a re-entry stamp at the exit).

We returned to the Gardens for the 7:45 PM light show.

We watched from the Super Tree dining area, as well as near the Super Trees.

The dining area provided an excellent overview without the crowds.

The light show lasted 15 minutes.

I'm glad we went, but I wasn't overwhelmed by the music or the light show.

The Gardens are easily accessible using the MRT via the Bayfront stop (~10 minute walk) or a variety of bus lines, most of which stopped near the Marina Bay Sands Hotel.

If you can visit one site in Singapore, make it this one.",,
,,Beautiful Structures,4,,"The botanical garden might be the highlight of our Singapore trip. Not that there was much to do but view plants and take pictures, but the man made structures outside meant to resemble trees were very picturesque! The garden itself is indoor and has alot of plants subdivided into categories (japanese, exotic etc.) and made for beautiful pictures.",,
,,brillant,5,,"this is the must do on anyones visit to singapore, we visited in the afternoon so we could take in the domes and the light show. the domes were really good and while busy you could find little corners of peace to look up and enjoy the surroundings.the evening we timed are visit to the skywalk just right and got up there as the light faded. and we remained up there for some of the light show , which was really good made better because the music played was from my youth, felt young again even if it was only for 15 minutes. Had some food there as well which was really good as well. a great aftrnoon out",,
,,Detailing!,5,,"It's a treat for the senses! Innumerable varieties of flowers won't allow you to pass by without you wanting to click a photo of them. Immaculate detailing so you can experience the flowers and plants with leisure.
Breathtaking is the word that will strike you the first time you see the huge waterfall. Admirable that it's entirely man-made.
Not to be missed.
Provision 4 hours for this place.",,
,,Amazing gardens and experience,5,,If you like gardens you will love this one. I can recommend to get to gardens in the morning and go first to visit the domes in the morning it was empty until about 11 after lunch it鈥檚 so many people visiting that it is hard to take photos and move around same goes for the cloud dome do that one first so you can get great photos at the water falls!!! For each dome you need comfortably about an hour. Don鈥檛 forget to go back for the super tree light show in the evening that is a must see experience one more thing inside both the domes is really cold and it鈥檚 a shock comparing the temperature outside I had a rain jacket and was great full I had one lots of people got cough out and didn鈥檛 enjoy the experience long enough....,,
,,The tranquility within a city!,4,,"A step into the garden will definitely
zest you up with all the greeneries and flowers, feels like you are trap in a ""gigantic green house jungle' surrounded with the scent of greens and flowers with the sound of the waterfall.
Great way from escaping away from the hot weather here!
Makes one feel like you are in 'Alice in a wonderland!'",,
,,Garden by the bay,5,,One of the best place which should visit at night because there do have a fantastic light show with music.,,
,,Good overall visit.,3,,"We visited the cloud forest, Flower dome and the Christmas Wonderland-all were nice and colorful; however I felt it was a bit expensive for a man made attraction. The Botanic Gardens were more impressive. All attractions here are individually priced and the Christmas Supertree area is another cost. For adults there isn鈥檛 much in the Christmas area-great place for some gorgeous pics of the super trees is about it.",,
,,Simply amazing,5,,"Words or pics cannot describe how amazing this place is.
It鈥檚 a definite 鈥榤ust do鈥?if you visit Singapore. The Cloud Forest and Flower Dome will leave you speechless BUT despite the outside temperature, I would suggest that you take a jacket as they鈥檙e very cool.",,
,,Quite surprised,5,,"This garden was so amazing is that most of the main attractions were indoors with really good air conditioning and I got in for free as part of an excursion organized by our workshop organizers to break the ice. Prepare for amazing and picturesque spots and to spend a lot of money on beautiful souvenirs. Come at night and enjoy the colors and the lighting, you won鈥檛 regret it.

Highly recommended.",,
,,Improving evertime I visit.,5,,"Being my 3rd visit to the Gardens it was surprising to see just how much things have grown. A good exhibition in both Domes and the signature Super Grove climbers are nearing the top.
Made even better as the Xmas exhibition was starting to take place. Always a relaxing place to visit. Did not stay for the evening light show due bad weather.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,The gardens by the bay are absolutely stunning. You could spend all day and night there or just a few hours. The plants are amazing and the light show was very entertaining- a lot of fun. The crowd was big at 745pm for the light show but not a problem. They were charging to get into the light show for the month of December because they also set up the Christmas display in there but there are other places to view the lights from.,,
,,Just Amazing,5,,"The Gardens by the Bay are a must to visit when in Singapore. Perfectly amazing, is my description. Such a vast impressive area, all beautifully laid out and maintained. A real credit to Singapore. Far too beautiful to review in a few words - just go there and see for yourself.",,
,,Cloud forest was amazing,5,,Cloud forest is a breathtaking spectacle. Unlike anything I'd ever seen before. You have to do this when you're in Singapore.,,
,,Beautiful garden,5,,"I read somewhere that this is one of the 100 places in the world that we should visit in our lifetime. Indeed it is. I have been there 4 times in 2 years and never gotten sick of the place as the flowers and plants were of wide variety. Especially the flowers, there were exotic flowers imported from overseas seasonally. I always felt very energized and refreshed every time I visited the place as the air was full of ions.",,
,,Beautiful place to visit,5,,Worlds largest green house - impressive place to visit. So beautiful. Saw some ancient olive trees with olives ready for picking! Saw other varieties from all over the world. Impressive.,,
,,Magical Light and music show,5,,Went on the city night tour which included Chinatown (Street Food Market) and Gardens by the Bay next to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Music and light extravaganza. Wonderful!,,
,,Iconic views and signature shots,5,,"If you put together the list of top things to do, this certainly is one. An easy walk through and so many opportunities to capture the super trees in the background. Walking in ""stop and stare"" mode at the garden sculptures and trees makes you feel you ate truly on holiday in a magical place. Manicured and well signed. I will return.",,
,,Forget the rest. This is the best. Amazing.,5,,"We had three hours free to go to the gardens. We walked across an easy bridge from our hotel and were very soon amongst some pf the finest and inspirational gardens anywhere. We loved the conservatories. We gave the trees a miss as the queue was long. At first we found it difficult to understand all of what was on show and to make the best choice of what was available at that time. We didn't do enough homework, so my advice is to find out as much as possible before you go.",,
,,Stunning by Day or Night,5,,Yet another awesome must see while your in Singapore. In the shadow of Marina Bay Sands Hotel and visible from pretty much the whole Bay Area . We went at night and is has a feel of being other worldly. The layout is compact and easy managed in half an hour. By day we could see loads of people sitting in the shade relaxing. A cocktail on the roof bar of the Marine Bay Sands Hotel finished of the evening perfectly.,,
,,Beautiful gardens,5,,"Wonderful visit to Gardens by the Bay. Loved the Cloud Dome with the ferns and orchids. The flower dome was a little disappointing because they had used the floor of the dome for Christmas decorations, which were wonderful, but I would have like to have seen more flowers. Strongly recommend a visit.",,
,,UNIQUE!!!!!,5,,"Just two words to describe this place: UNIQUE and SPECTACULAR.
Very organized and structured place.
With a lot of interesting things to see and visit. One important aspect is the fact that you go to Gardens by the bay and learn more about nature and is importance.",,
,,Worth a visit,4,,I must admit i did prefer than botanic gardens to this place. But i still enjoyed it. Very tourity & exi. Lots to see - definitely plan staying there for a full day so you can take it all in with plenty of time.,,
,,Great Place for Kids and Family,5,,Worth visiting and enjoy the Gardens. Very well kept and maintained. They have several different gardens such as Asian garden with Asian theme. Would take a few hours to spend time if you are into botany.,,
,,Must See!,5,,"The Gardens By The Bay is a must see in Singapore. From the artificial flowers/trees that are most visible, to the lush park, the area presents a welcome break from the frantic pace of Singapore.",,
,,Great,5,,Very well laid out and a superb garden . Definitely a visit not to be missed . Would strongly recommend .,,
,,Beautiful,5,,"The gardens are beautiful, best seen at night. There is a light display each evening so check for times and make sure you are in the right location. Easy to get to on the MRT.",,
,,Gardend by the Bay,4,,"One of the obvious places to visit in Singapore. We travelled by SMRT which was quick, cheap and easy plus there was a tourist guide there who gave us a map and directions. There is also a shuttle stop here that takes you to the visitor centre for tickets to the domes. The walk is interesting with lakes and different garden areas to look at but the signposting is not overly clear so the map was helpful. There are different themed areas with planting to match.
We chose to take an audio tour around the park which is very big. This lasted about 20 mins and gave a history of the gardens as well as information, brief and rapid so concentrate! Worth it if walking is a problem.
The sky walk around the super trees can be closed at a moments notice if there is thunder or rain, we queued twice then gave up but it looks worthwhile. The Supertrees are certainly spectacular and you really don't get their size until you are up close. We visited both domes, the flower one was a little underwhelming but pleasant and the tropical dome was made for impact, we would have liked a bit more information/education about it. I expect the heavy bias on conservation near the end was targeting the Chinese and other far east tourists as it was nothing new to us.
Allow yourself a lot of time and plan where you want to eat as mealtimes were busy and the cafes/restaurants are spaced out. A good day out that needs some planning. Didn't go back for the evening light show so can't comment but there was a xmas market which didn't open til the evening - looked a little tacky.",,
,,Must go place,5,,Must go place in singapore ..enjoi the cloud dome..flower dome during the day..but do not miss the mesmerising light show of the night..,,
,,Exploring the nature,4,,Gardens by the bay is one of the tourist attraction in Singapore.besides the tourist there are good no of locals who visits this place specially in weekend.entire space is covered by glass and temperature controlled.so you don鈥檛 have to worry for sudden rain which is very common in Singapore .,,
,,BEAUTIFUL,5,,"A lot of walking involved but well worth it for the absolutely beautiful view and scenery. Flower dome and cloud forest is a must visit for tourists, especially if you鈥檙e a plant lover or just want to get some insta-worthy pictures. The gift shop is also amazing and unique. Other than those two attractions, the location is more suitable for just jogging or walks.",,
,,Big garden,5,,You can spend a long time walking around the garden. Is free to walk around the outside of the garden and you can expect to walk for miles. There is a inside bit of the garden where you have to pay to get in.,,
,,NOTHING LIKE IT,5,,"I feel like I was in another world. Its beautiful, gracious and it just blow your mind away. A big thumps up for those staff who have to take care and maintain the garden.",,
,,Inspirational and innovative,5,,"There is so much hype on other reviews about Gardens by the Bay that I came prepared to be disappointed. Far from it - I'm joining the hype. Absolutely wonderful gardens and the two domes are a stroke of genius. I was awestruck by the beauty of the domes and such a wonderful sanctuary to escape the Singapore heat. Both domes are a very pleasant temperature and humidity and it would be easy to stay there all day. Cloud dome is awe-inspiring. A tip for the cloud dome! Essentially you walk along a path and then take a lift to the top and walk along aerial paths and other exhibits on your way back down to where they might expect you to exit. Well that's the psychological idea to keep the crowds moving (and out). Once you are about to exit the dome, if you walk around to the right (and this is not sign posted) you come across the lift that can take you back up to the top. You're actually a level below where you got in!

The skywalk is well worth the effort. The entrance to the skywalk is not the easiest to find, even when you might be quite close. Perhaps because it wasn't too crowded there were no queues!!",,
,,The Place That We Must Go,5,,"This is the only garden in Singapore with air-conditioning. As a tourist, make sure you have the stamina to walk around the whole Gardens by the Bay. It may take you a day to finish it. At night, the supertree is magnificently beautiful. Worth visiting and take a lotssssss of photos.",,
,,Nice Sunday walk,4,,"This place feels so nice and relaxing.I went there on a sunday. and we could also get some OBikes. It feels refreshing to walk under the trees, and you are still a few steps away from the city. Really great. I recommend going their with kids.",,
,,Worth visiting,5,,Amazing place and build beautifully hats off to the genius behind the buildup make sure you both doom.......,,
,,"Very busy , a long way to walk",3,,The gardens are lovely but extremely crowded when we went late afternoon. A long way to walk and limited availability of help for people with mobility issues. Staff courteous but not much help with transport. I wouldn鈥檛 recommend unless fully fit,,
,,Beautiful gardens,5,,Spent 4 hrs looking around the gardens in the shadow of the awesome looking marina bay sands hotel. Gardens are kept beautiful and there are light shows in the evening from the garden centre piece and from the bay sands hotel,,
,,Lovely garden that has much to offer,5,,"This is a great place for a stroll or just to relax as there are a lot of greenery, plants and sights to see. There are free attractions such as:
-the Super tree grove with free light shows at night
-far east organisation children's garden (free waterplay, play areas and more)
-sun pavilion
-heritage gardens, Bay east garden

The following are paid attractions found here:
-cloud forest (nothing much honestly, just greenery, elevated boardwalks, an indoor exhibition and a waterfall)
-flower dome (a beautiful attraction filled with vibrant flowers, smells, art and statues)
-OCBC skyway

During the Christmas season there is a Christmas wonderland ongoing till 26 Dec this year, with carnival rides, booths, games, shows and performances!
Overall a beautiful serene garden offering a variety of attractions, not to mention, good food!",,
,,Gardens to Appreciate,5,,The Gardens by the Bay is a must do destination. It can be a whole of family experience. What has been created will touch your senses. Allow plenty of time to soak up the atmosphere and tranquility.,,
,,They really want your money,3,,I liked the cloud garden a lot but it really annoyed me that they had a 鈥榳inter wonderland鈥?on and you had to pay to enter it to get to the skywalk. Even if you had no interest in the 鈥榳inter wonderland鈥? Then they hadn鈥檛 bothered to change their signs so every direction we went in to try to get to the mrt was blocked off. Walked in circles for ages. Complained to staff who clearly couldn鈥檛 care less. The ticket for the cloud garden and flower dome is expensive. The cloud garden is very impressive but the flower garden not so much (not worth the price for sure).,,
,,It鈥檚 worth it...,5,,Yes: It鈥檚 worth it. I very much enjoyed walking around GBTB. It鈥檚 clean and organized and attractive. What more could you ask for?,,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,"Truly amazing architecture, plants, shrubs, design + more. There is a children's area to play & run through water fountains. Highly recommend this as a must do",,
,,Nice light show,4,,"Went there for the evening light show. Did not get to roam around much; the place is big and there are a lot of things to pass the time by. The light show however was crowded, with some people lying down on the floor, but over all it was a good experience. Would I come again for the light show? Once is enough",,
,,Wow,5,,We went here and on buying ticket we were informed they had the Winter Wonderland display on. It was spectacular. The domes were great but the light and sound show really made it a spectacle,,
,,A must visit place!,5,,"Divided into 3 parts- cloud forest, flower dome and ocbc skywalk. U should definitely visit here as it is one of the main attraction of singapore. Cloud forest welcomes u with a waterfall which feels refreshing and soothing. Flower dome has varieties of flowers.",,
,,Greatly Exceeded My Expectations!,5,,This was one of the things on my list to see in Singapore having watched some of the building on a TV special. It blew my mind. This is easily one of the best things I visited in the last few years. It is a MUST SEE for sure.,,
,,A must go,5,,The flower dome and the cloud forest is a mandatory experience I am would say. One cannot afford to miss the largest greenhouse of the world.,,
,,Must visit,5,,Of course this is a must see. I really enjoyed it despite it being a tourist attraction. On a Thursday night it wasn鈥檛 too crowded and we enjoyed the Christmas themed light show. Definitely worth your time and not too expensive. I wish I had known there were food options though because we would鈥檝e eaten there instead of an expensive restaurant at Marina Bay.,,
,,Must see in Singapore,5,,"Beautifully landscaped, relaxing, oasis away from the hustle and bustle of Singapore. Can definitely spend couple of hours here wandering around. At night the Light show is spectacular and while can be viewed from afar, impact is awesome from up close. Be prepared to contend with crowds at night but is a very enjoyable experience.",,
,,Put this on the list,5,,"A botanical and technological beauty, we went along with hard to impress teens, and they loved it too.",,
,,Peaceful and plenty of variety,4,,Lots of different themes here. Lush plants and a lot of bird life. Water features and raised boardwalks high above the gardens to take in the views. Well worth a visit - give yourself a lot of time to really enjoy it,,
,,Stunning!,5,,"A must see when in Singapore, we went here on a rainy day. We were surprised with an astounding array of flowers and the sheer scale of the place. Beautiful",,
,,Beautiful!,5,,The most to visit when you planning to go to Singapore!! You will not get bored if you visit this place!,,
,,Beautiful modern garden,5,,We went to both cloud dome and flower dome. It鈥檚 like a little oasis in the midst of hustle and bustle of urban Singapore. The flower dome always has different theme depending on the season. The garden area surrounding the domes is pretty and well maintained as well. Definitely worth a visit.,,
,,My Favorite Attraction whenever I鈥檓 in SG,5,,I love Garden鈥檚 by the Bay. It鈥檚 a very beautiful place to go to less crowds and best of all airconditioned. I鈥檓 always learning new landscaping ideas whenever I go here. This is my happy place. One of the most beautiful gardens on the planet.,,
,,I had to return - it is so beautiful and well done - great place for nature lover,5,,it is a unique place and so well done - I Simply had to return on my 4th visit to Sgp. An eye sight for a nature lover - though all arranged. The skywalk is amazing - what a sight! and all the Xmas decoration - wouh! - It has it's price as everything in Singapore.,,
,,Must see,5,,"It's a man-made nature park and is temperature control.Its one of the must see attractions of Singapore.It has flower dome and cloud forest.The flower dome has seven different gardens of different countries inside it .It has lots of exotic varieties of flowers and plants. Its aiconditioned .Cloud forest has plants which are found in tropical mountains and has a huge waterfall at the entrance.Its a cool,moist temperature control glass House.
There is an entry ticket to view these.
It's beautiful to see them in day and even in the evening with the lights it had a spectacular view.
One can walk around the supertree grove and the OCBC walkway is wonderful.
They have a musical light show at 7:45/8:45 pm and it's not to be missed as it's outstanding.The light show has no entry ticket.
One can easily spend 2-3 hours at the garden of bay.Watching the sunset from this place is also amazing.
It's definitely a place worth the visit",,
,,Nice park,5,,Take a stroll along the park while you enjoy the scenic view on sunrise and take a walk along the OCBC skywalk & supertree groove.,,
,,Beautiful City,5,,Garden by the bay is very beautiful. Many attraction and the flower domes are amazing. Lots to see and take photo!,,
,,Beauty beyond belief,5,,We went to the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest. Both were spectacular. We have never been to anything garden as beautiful as these. Everything was so trimmed and taken care of.....GORGEOUS.,,
,,Wow....,5,,"The Gardens are beautiful...thoroughly enjoyed my wander around the gardens, it is amazing what they have achieved here, the walkways, waterfalls etc are lovely. Have been told they are even more spectacular at night when they are all lit up.",,
,,Magnificent!,5,,Sophisticatedly blended with both the natural and artificial ! Huge enough to accommodate numerous tourists without feeling crowded. The OCBC walk provides you very scenic photo opportunities. The cloud forest is a must see! Better to spare one day for a relaxed day visit!,,
,,Loved the Light Show!,5,,"Ever since I first saw pictures of these colourful trees in a magazine I鈥檝e wanted to go and see them - delighted with the real thing! We arrived on the last hop on/off bus of the day and walked down to the Supertree grove. There was only a short queue for the skyway ($8) so it didn鈥檛 take too long to get into the lift and get out 22 metres up amongst the trees. I liked the orchids tucked into the tree trunks and the views were impressive but I was relieved to find that you could get a lift down at the far end and not have to walk all the way back again! After a meal onsite we found a spot to sit and view the light show, it was a bit of a squeeze so don鈥檛 leave it too close to the start time - 7.45pm or 8.45pm. So glad that we stayed to see the wonderful lights, colours and, on the night we were there, it was songs from musical shows. It was easy to walk to the mrt train station to return to our hotel. A highlight of our stay in Singapore, would like to visit again to see more of the Gardens.",,
,,"Grand, very natural looking set up",5,,Cloud Forrest is more impressive of the two domes. The simulated rain forrest with the selection of plants and flowers is mind boggling. The flower dome decor adapts to varying themes. This time the theme was christmas.,,
,,Love it,5,,"A beautiful area of Singapore, clean, tidy and well sign posted. Love this place and the two Gio domes were also awesome. This place is a must when visiting this city.",,
,,"Cloud forest dome, recommended!",4,,"The flower dome and cloud forest were awesome. My family likes it, and the kids got to learn about environment sustainability. We love to spend our time there. Our favorite was the cloud forest dome. Its waterfall was amazing.
However, the light show was not as spectacular as I expected. For those who travels with small kids, I wouldn鈥檛 recommend wasting your time waiting for the light show. After a long walk inside the dome, I would prefer to just have dinner and go back to the hotel.
Tips: visit the cloud forest dome before sunset, as you need the sunlight to enjoy the beauty of the waterfall.",,
,,fantastic place,5,,"absolute amazing place in Singapore, a must to visit, lots to see and places to see, its an experience in itself",,
,,Fascinating and defiantly worth going,5,,Just went for the Tsum Tsum Themed Exhibition and the display was awesome! Flowers changes every season. Looking forward to the next flower exhibition in March.,,
,,Good wander with spectacular sights.,4,,"Really nicely laid out. Bit too much to take in. Skywalk very good, as was Cloud Forest. Flower Dome spoilt by Christmas displays. I suppose it was for children to enjoy, but was a marked contrast, one being organic, and the Christmas displays being plastic!!",,
,,"A great place, even in the rain!",5,,"This is a large area on the bay side of Marina Bay Sands hotel. You get super views of the hotel from almost anywhere in the Gardens.
There are two large enclosed areas of which the Cloud Forest is by far the most interesting and spectacular if you are pushed for time. This was our second visit and it was still inspirational to see. There are plenty of places to eat and drink as you wander round and the walk around the lake was especially good to do and had impressive stainless steel sculptures of dragonflies. We didn't see the otters unfortunately but they are around if you get lucky.",,
,,Beautiful,4,,"Very beautiful place, and its indoor therefore making it more comfortable than to walk in the heat. Very busy place",,
,,Breathtaking!,5,,The movies don't do it justice.We had the opportunity to explore the Gardens by the Bay. The weather was just right. Not to hot with a nice cool breeze. The gardens were exquisite! yet another great place to mark off the bucket list. The super trees are awe inspiring and a modern marvel. Singapore really understands how to complement architecture with beauty and sustainability! It was well worth the trip!,,
,,What a great place!,5,,"This is part of the uniqueness of Singapore and not to be missed. Wander around beautifully set out gardens, enjoy the views and marvel at the huge trees.",,
,,Amazing Gardens,5,,I made my way to the venue by MRT it was easy to find and just a short walk from the station. You can get tickets for the 2 gardens and the skywalk separately or all as 1 I didn't do the skywalk as it seemed a bit much for what it actually is? The gardens are amazing and should not be missed if visiting Singapore. Temperature controlled inside the gardens by the way. I found a nice little shop for lunch while I was there so plenty of options while in the area.,,
,,well worth a vist,5,,"THe gardens have two domes, the cloud dome is the best one to visit. The star atraction are the trees that light up and chnage colour to music each evening, which also happens to be free of charge. The walk way between the trees is well worth a trip up in the lift if you're ok with heights. The best place to view the light show is from the ground. Get there early and find a good seat at the centre.",,
,,"Pleasant, but not as impressive as Cloud Forest Dome.",4,,"Attractive and relaxing, but not as good as the amazing Cloud Forest Dome. The Christmas display will make children happy.",,
,,Beautiful gardens.,5,,"Allow a good half day to walk around and enjoy these incredible gardens and glass houses. It is best to go in the afternoon and be sure to stay on for the ""Sound and light"" display, which takes place around 08.00pm each evening.",,
,,Supertrees are spectacular,5,,"We visited one of the flower domes as part of an afternoon tour that included the sky park. Did not know beforehand that we could have walked around the supertrees without purchasing an admission ticket. Since it was raining pretty hard, we did not get to walk around outside much. The dome was all decked out for Christmas.",,
,,Nature and technology at their best,5,,"Such a beautiful garden, l have never seen anything like this! The atmosphere was great. The people are so humble and friendly 鉂?
,,A pleasant way to spend a couple of hours,4.0,,I enjoyed my visit to gardens by the bay. Relaxing"," interesting and informative. There are currently major works underway to set up for Christmas but I guess that's unlucky timing on my part.""",
,,Futuristic and fascinating,5,,"We visited early evening, just amazing!
It feels like another world!
It gets quite crowded at times, but it is only
where people are justifiably taking photos
of some amazing views of the flora, fauna,
waterfall, Marina Bay Sands Hotel and the incredible futuristic illuminated towering trees.
The suspended walkways are incredible.
Possibly better to go into the smaller dome first
and the main rainforest dome second, a build up to the main event as it were.
Arrive around 6pm, watch the sunset, walk around the domes then enjoy the light show and illuminations. The only downside was, as it had been raining during the afternoon , understandably the higher walkways outside
were closed until later in the evening when the
walkways had properly dried. Good safety sense. However this is a fantastic attraction,
a real spectacle. Futuristic science fiction
brought to life now! Just like Buck Rogers in the
21st century if you can remember that
Not to be missed.",,
,,"Not particularly exciting, but a nice enough place to visit to escape the heat.",3,,"It's extremely well organized and an engineering marvel - but it's not incredibly interesting or fun. Cloud forest and flower dome would be interesting if you're a gardening or flower nerd, but somewhat tedious to go through if you don't have a special interest in seeing every plant and flower on the planet. Skip it if you have anything else to do.",,
,,Busy changing for the Christmas season,4,,"We loved visiting here including the cloud forest which was our highlight. However the day we went they were changing everything around for Christmas so it was very loud, busy and difficult to navigate around all the roped off areas! Despite this we would recommended it to others and come again ourselves as it was clearly just a bad choice of day!",,
,,Awesome at night,4,,"I had 14 hours to myself in SIngapore so headed down to Gardens by the Bay after dinner and arrived on the MTR at about 9:30pm at night. The place was still buzzing with people wandering around and taking photos of the impressive artificial trees. This is one of those places that are better at night, no entry fee so you can just wander down there whenever you feel. Worth an after dinner trip if in town.",,
,,great experience.,5,,I have been before but enjoyed the Gardens by the Bay so much. It was cool & pleasant inside & recommend it to everyone. this is a world class attraction a must see.,,
,,Spectacular,4,,"Singapore has created a marvelous exhibition at Gardens by the Bay. The variety of plants, flowers, and landscapes was amazing, with the waterfall being the highlight.

My only criticism was the waste of space within the area set aside for ""crystals"" I'm sure this area could have been put to better use with something else.",,
,,Fantastic,5,,"A must see in Singapore, take all day not just a few hours to experience it all. The light show at night is a sight to see",,
,,Relaxing outing,4,,Very beautiful and tranquil setting by day and night. Lovely views. Great sculptures and gardens. Even saw some otters.,,
,,Outstanding man-made creation,5,,"A large and beautiful area with outstanding architectural creations. The plants in the domes are amazing and beautiful. The temperature is also constantly cool so great to escape from The Singapore heat. The photographs are always amazing but being there exceeds the expectation.
Best way to get there is by SMRT which is also air conditioned.",,
,,Magical place,5,,"I visited the place twice, once in the evening just to have a walk around when I first arrived to Singapore and once during the day to have proper experience of the attractions. I enjoyed both times. The OCBC walk was really interesting, offers great views of the gardens and the Marina Bay Sands. Really affordable at 8 SGD. Following a friend's recommendation I also went to see the Cloud Forest. You can't just go to the forest, you need to buy a combo ticket for the flower dome and the cloud forest. I have to say I found the flower dome quite underwhelming and if you're not into flowers, probably not a must see place. The Christmas exhibition was nice but apart from that nothing too impressive. The cloud forest had more of a wow factor. There are specific times when they mist the place, I unfortunately missed that time but would be interesting to see what it looks like then. The big waterfall is impressive, as well as the walk around the lost city. I think the whole place looks unreal and is well worth a visit (at least once)",,
,,Relaxing and thoroughly magical.,5,,"Just as it appears in the brochures! Astonishing to think of all the work that the designers and gardeners have gone to, to have brought this vision to life. Truly gorgeous.",,
,,Must not miss,5,,"Definitely worth a trip to this area. One can just spend hours and hours at the gardens and will take days to see everything. They do have a bus tour that shows you the major portions. Also must hit up the flower dome and the forest dome, those were the highlights of the gardens.",,
,,Gardens!,4,,"Beautiful, worth trying, one of its kind, must see in Singapore, not very expensive considering the currency exchange",,
,,Wonderful day out of the heat,5,,Highly recommend Gardens by the Bay- it鈥檚 a beautiful setting and provides a nice landscape without the hot humid weather of the outdoors.,,
,,Educational and beautiful experience,4,,"Recommend for all ages. The exhibits are very well done, educational and modern. The waterfall is spectacular and the greenhouse plants are amazing.",,
,,Dive into different styled gardens and scenery,5,,"Take a lovely stroll in this beautiful layout of a land where you can literally get lost in but still have to take pictures because the place is beautifully designed and kept. At night they have their light show which you should totally watch as its artful dance of lights transports you to a fantasy land... if you can finally find the location of the supertrees. Sit down as the music and lights take your pain from walking a little too much away as the night sky blankets you.
But for real, its a beautiful place though I recommend walking/running shoes and maybe someone who knows where to go :D",,
,,Cool gardens!,5,,"These gardens are really cool, especially if you visit at night. Really huge, well made. Definitely recommend it when you visit Singapore!",,
,,A must in Singapore,5,,"It is such a great place to walk, you will have to pay to get to the Flower garden , it is a fun thing to do, cool inside which is always a good break from the humidity and heat outside",,
,,World class,5,,A must see when in Singapore. The gardens are so beautiful and a world class attraction. I must say the walk around the top of the dome was great but freaked me out a few times. Not great on those type of walks,,
,,Pretty awesome,5,,"Definitely a must visit when in Singapore - the super trees are crazy impressive, and the night show is cheesy but fun. See one of the domes and learn how you can be more eco friendly.",,
,,Must visit,5,,"It is a lifetime experience where you get to see so many plants all around the globe at one place in the flower dome and the best is the cloud forest
The cloud forest is just amazing and one should visit in his/her life atleast once",,
,,Steel wonderland,4,,"It was very crowded in the afternoon. The light show was beautiful though. Stopped by for dinner, the restaurants served yummy food and fast. Wish we had come earlier to the 鈥榯ree walk鈥?
,,Beautifully blissful,5.0,,We loved it so much here. There was so much to see and be completely wowed by. The Cloud Forest and Flower domes are a must see. We particularly loved the Cloud Forest. Food was reasonably priced at Satay by the Bay as well as very tasty. There was so much to see and do within the gardens that we ran out of time. However it gave us the perfect excuse to return for the OCBC Skyway and Supertree Grove as well as see the light show which happens twice every evening and was a retro discolicious heaven. Highly recommended.
,,well worth a visit,5.0,,amazing gardens. the cloud dome was the best part of it. flower dome was beautiful too. very big gardens. will need plenty of time to get around. highly recommend a visit. was one of the highlights of my visit to singapore. the lights show at night is worth a look too if you're still in the area.
,,Amazing covered gardens,5.0,,Gardens by the Bay is a unique concept in Singapore where they have preserved flowers and trees from multiple parts of the world in an artificial environment. Found the ticket price to be a bit high but it was worth it. Cloud garden was nice too.
,,Spectacular,5.0,,It is such a beautiful man-made park. Enjoyed the talk between the trees. Had a great meal at indochine at the top of one of the trees. Good way to end a busy day or week.
,,Very nice place,4.0,,I came here for a relaxing walk and to take in the views. There was not so many people here like other attractions
,,No lineups,5.0,,Walked over from metro around 11am Thursday morning absolutely no lineups. Just strolled up and bought tkt for both greenhouses $28. Just walked straight in both domes no crowds. If you purchase tkt in advance you still have to go to window to exchange voucher. Extra tkt for outside aerial walkway that is frequently opened and closed due to rain or lightening. Domes are interesting but spoilt by tacky christmas decorations. Lovely natural animal artwork among plants. Took a 20 minute narrated shuttle tour of outside theme gardens for $8 ok explains supertrees etc. These should be seen after dark outside is all free and very easy to get too.
,,Audrey,5.0,,Fantastic double fantastic. A must see For anyone coming to Singapore. The design is out of this world. A complete experience.
,,Amazing,4.0,,Both domes are well worth a visit", if only to marvel at the scale of the structures. Both a very cool and easy to move about in. We went in the lead up to Christmas and the Flower Dome was all decked out for the season. Even if your not a nature buff it鈥檚 a great place to just chill and wander about in. The Cloud Forest is just spectacular and really should be seen. There鈥檚 also plenty of seating area around so you can just sit for awhile and take it all in.,
"Also the views from both domes are worth seeing.""",,,,,,,
,,Very nice sunny day,5,,Day or night. This place is amazing .spend hours just walking around .or walking on the sky walk. Nice restaurant are there to,,
,,Amazing,5,,The Gardens were one of the main drivers for our trip to Singapore as I had seen some articles on it and it just looked amazing and I was certainly not disappointed. For me this is a really ambitious and adventurous location which is really unique and well worth seeing and experiencing. For me this was a great space and met all the expectations. I just loved the scale and ambition of this.,,
,,Fantastic futuristic place to visit,5,,"The Gardens by the Bay is a must see in Singapore. The tall tree structures have the most interesting plants growing up them, surrounded by beautiful tropical gardens. Great eating market there too!",,
,,Nice park,5,,"Not much to say other than it's a nicely designed park with some interesting water features, trees, giant babies, etc. Usual park kind of stuff.",,
,,A must see place in Singapore,5,,"We visited the place in the morning time in a week day. Very nice place. Super trees are simply awesome. OCBC Sky walk view is amazing. Ticket is needed for skywalk, Cloud forest and Flower dome. Very beautifully maintained places. Every day there is a light and music at 7.45pm and 8.45pm. Do not miss that. But stand far from the trees, so that you can get a proper view of the show. If you stand under the trees, it will be difficult to see.Also, if you want to go to Marina Bay skywalk from Garden by the Bay, take the straight road from the cloud forest, beside the river. There is an underpass that connects to the Marina Bay hotel.That will save your time.",,
,,One of the jewels in Singapore,5,,"Wonderful garden with many options. Even if you don鈥檛 want to pay the admission fee for some of the attractions, you can just walk around and enjoy the views. If it鈥檚 too warm, or if it鈥檚 raining, just sit in the hallway in front of the ticket counters.",,
,,Fantastic day out!,5,,"We visited here as part of our honeymoon and had a wonderful time. We decided to do the tree walk and visit the cloud forest and flower dome.

The tree walk was excellent and provided fantastic views across the gardens and marina bay.

We also really enjoyed the cloud forest as there was so much to see (it was also nice and cool which was very refreshing after a morning wanting around the gardens).

Overall it was an excellent experience which far exceeded our expectations.",,
,,beautiful landscape,4,,"you can feel relax in this place, nice flowers too, best time in the evening you will enjoy the different colors of light",,
,,beautiful,5,,"The place to go, enchanting and informative lovely views, walks and do take the tree top walk. Stunning",,
,,Cloud garden is a must!,3,,"Cloud garden is very special, a must see. The other flower garden was nothing special but you can buy a combo ticket for a discount to both.

Gardens by the bay is extra pretty at night when the trees light up for a show!!

The trees are a free attraction but you can get a $8 ticket to the skywalk for lovely views of the bay.",,
,,Super light show,5,,"Really enjoyed this especially in the evening, we paid to do the walkway earlier which was a waste of money for me, as the height and width of this was quite scary!
The light show is however free, I believe that the music selection varies, we were lucky enough to get 鈥楻etro Fest鈥?which was disco centred, great fun, would love to see again some time with a different soundtrack.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,A beautiful scene with many different flowers and a lovely treetop walk. Definitely worth a visit! Highly reccomend.,,
,,Great experience,5,,"Not really aimed solely at garden lovers. The gardens are great to walk around and get away from big city Singapore. Great picture spot. The vertical garden space, especially at night are fun. The 2 cool houses are worth a visit - a little expensive but great to see and educate.",,
,,A must visit,5,,"A great experience, thoroughly recommend a visit to the Gardens by the Bay. Unfortunately we could only visit during the day, by night they would spectacular.",,
,,Amazing technology,5,,We saw this during the day and stayed for the light show which was absolutely fantastic. The technology is second to none and not to be missed if you are going to Singapore,,
,,Normal,4,,Nice area look BUTY and v. Good place to visit it is rich with all resources and need for the visitors,,
,,gardens by the bay,5,,"a must if you go to singapore, beautiful gardens its a good walk around, they had a lovely little xmas display in the middle if you go at this time of year ,you can spend hours here so good walking shoes are a must,it rained a lot this time of year but its the rainy season so don't forget your umbrella",,
,,A MUST DO!,5,,The gardens were spectacular You must see them at night and during the day. If you time it right at night time you can catch the waterfront show on the marina and then walk across for the night time light show,,
,,A visit with friends,5,,Would definitely recommend this. It was excellent. I though it would be hot inside but it was very cool. Such varied plants and trees inside.,,
,,A wonderful place - do not miss this - get there just before sunset to enjoy it in the light and dark,5,,"I loved this place and spent ~2 hours here - it could easily have been 4 or 5. It is made up of two main domes (Skywalk and Flower) which house rich botanical specimens and very well constructed walkways and paths. Inside there are elevated walkways to wander through and sights up and down everywhere. It might be a bit scary for those unsure of heights but exhilarating for everyone else.
Outside are the Supertrees - giant constructed funnel shapes to represent trees. The magic of those is in their lighting - it is dynamic, beautiful and in a nightly show, with pumping dance music (70's mostly - Abba, James Brown, Chicago etc.) it is stunning. They are huge and the lighting ranges from subtle to outrageously brilliant.
I was only in Singapore for 2 nights but I will remember this place forever.",,
,,"Cloud Dome is Simply Amazing, Flower Dome worth it if you鈥檙e into plants. The AC is a plus",5,,"It鈥檚 something that catches your breath, something you wouldn鈥檛 expect. Cloud Dome is a must! Flower some is nice but if you are into plants and vegetation. My opinion is that the cloud dome is much more worth it. And both have A/C which is also very nice to get out of the heat.
They sell a discounted ticket if you buy both entries to the Clould Dome and Flower Dome it sounds attractive but if I were to do it again I would only go to the cloud Dome.",,
,,Better than imagined,5,,Just great value for money. Loverly day with lots to see. You need only 4/5 hours or so and that will work. If advise you arrive as sunsets. The lights and wonderful as is the light show.,,
,,Amazing Indoor Forest,5,,"Asian people don't need to out of Asia country and you can easily to enjoy the rare plants. It's indoor forest with air-conditional, comfortable walking experience and enjoy the night light music show. Definitely will visit second times.",,
,,SG2018,5,,"The garden is really beautiful and super nice for picture perfect shots, went here around sunset ad the lights are amazing",,
,,wonder of modern world!,5,,"there are 2 domes, both are well maintained and flowers and the fauna is mesmerizing. the waterfall and the complete area is very well maintained. not to miss the show in the evening.",,
,,Very Big,4,,If your going to go here make sure your ready to walk its very big and spaced out . we found the entrance fee to the flower domes and other places a bit expensive but worth going if your a flower lover,,
,,Amazing Gardens in a City,5,,"A surprise for my guests and I when we walked into the Gardens, especially the colours and feel (cool temperatures in the gardens was welcoming). The staff were helpful, giving a hand in taking pictures at the displays. The signage for leaving the gardens was not so clear, especially when there is an emergency Exit sign at the entry gate. A notice to indicate getting out the gardens is a level below can help.",,
,,Unmissable,5,,"We visited the gardens twice in one day. First thing in the morning when it was quiet and spent a few hours touring the super tree grove, treetop walkway and both domes. Just incredible.
Visited again to see the super tree grove light show after visiting the bar on the roof of the super tree restaurant. The views are stunning and the admission ticket is discounted from food or drink.
The light shows are at 7.45 and 8.45.
Beware that from November 29th you must pay to enter the grove at night as there is a Christmas show on now in the evening.",,
,,A must do!,5,,"If you only have limited time in Singapore then this is a must do.You can wander around the park free of charge and watch the super tree light & music show at 745pm & 845pm (weather permitting).Either watch from below or up on the tree walk ($8 Singapore ).Whilst here visit the flower dome full of amazing plants,sculptures and some great views & the cloud forest for amazing plants,trees,waterfall and sky walk within the dome again that has some great views of the big wheel,f1 pit lane and bay($28 Singapore for both,foreigner rate).This is located next to Marina Bay Hotel and easy to find.",,
,,Just incredible,5,,I only had around 4hrs at this place and wish I put aside an entire day. At $28 it鈥檚 not the cheapest but so worth it. I also got an audio guide for $4 - again worth it for all the info! Honestly so so beautiful. The only downside to going at a busy time is waiting and waiting AND waiting for the couples/families having photoshoots to get out the way for you to take a decent photo. So maybe go first thing of a morning? Either way a must visit when in Singapore!,,
,,Singapore's place to be for lovers of the nature.,5,,"I walked about 3 to 4 hours around this place: first a guided (electric) car/bus tour, then the plants garden (the flower garden was unfortunately closed) and finally the super tree light show. You just pay for the extra's like the bus and the entry to the closed gardens (that create a particular climate). Just walking around the park is for free. I learned quite a bit about the rainforest.",,
,,Garden by the Bay!!!,5,,"One of the highlights of our visit in Singapore, the flower and cloud dome are both amazing. I really enjoyed both dome. Beautiful indoor waterfall, skywalk, and different flowers. A must see!!!",,
,,Very Beautiful Show,5,,"I loved the beautiful artificial trees at the Gardens by the Bay. I also greatly enjoyed the night musical show, it was something I had never seen before.",,
,,An amazing place!,5,,"We loved the gardens by the bay. The I door waterfall along with all the many flowers was beautiful. Walking up on the decks was really lovely. The flower and tree exhibits where interesting, and worth the walk through.",,
,,"Beautiful Gardens, stay for the evening light show",5,,"Beautiful, recommend you go to the flower dome and the cloud dome.. I really enjoyed the cloud dome, beautiful waterfall and skywalk.",,
,,it has to be one of the best gardens in the world,5,,"Being a Singaporean, this is one of the best gardens one can walk through and visit. well built and very relaxing. Beautiful plants and flowers and they have seasonal flowers on display like during the Cherry Blossom season, Tulip festivals.. its really worth paying the entrance fee to the 2 Domes..",,
,,Awsm place,5,,Garden by the bay is awsm place to visit. U can see diffrent types of flowers and plants and best place for photography,,
,,Where wonders bloom,5,,Gardens by the Bay is a showpiece of horticulture and garden artistry. During the day is amazing and at night is even better. You could spend so long here just being amazed by the wonderful lights and structures. I would definately set aside lunch time to the evening to see everything. The light show at night was stunning and would highly recommend seeing this. There is also restaurants inside so you can grab a bite to eat or drink.,,
,,Night and day,4,,The gardens are spectacular both day and night. Take the sky walk for a great all round view. At night take a walk over the bridge from Marina Bay for an incredible light show. The surrounding gardens are relaxing and meticulous. Well priced for what you get.,,
,,Great attraction Think Eden on steroids,4,,"Enjoyed a return trip . Not sure the Xmas decorations enhanced the experience. Australian gardens, olive grove all good.",,
,,Supertree Grove Skyway,4,,"Gardens by the Bay is a well kept park close to Marina Bay Sands and the harbour. A nice activity to join is the Skyway on Supertree Grove, a short 22-metre-high walking that鈥檚 definitely worth the price of 8$ per person.
Super trees are giant artificial trees covered by grass and plants which we discovered, thanks to the captions arranged by the flowerbeds, have the function of water keepers. The water is then distributed to the garden when needed. This allows to reduce the amount of water introduced mechanically to maintain the whole garden.",,
,,Landmark of Singapore,5,,"This is a huge complex and if you have enough time you can spend whole day. I recommend to visit it in the afternoon. First to visit a Cloud forest and Flower dome, take a break in some of cafes, and when it's darks go to the garden Rhapsody show which starts at 7:45pm and 8:45pm.",,
,,Must see!!,5,,Definitely a must see when in Singapore. It鈥檚 different and everyone would enjoy it. Great places to take pics of the surrounding beauty of the city,,
,,Feels like in heaven,5,,"We have no idea how they manage to maintain all the thousand of types flowers, trees and plants under 1 single roof in Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. In awe with this creation. Will definitely come back!",,
,,Incredible and free,5,,"This places is incredible for many reasons. First is that free. There are 2 domes inside and they have a cost of SG25 for both domes that is like $20 US and they worth the money. All the park is conserved with water that they canalized from the rain, they use garbage and incinerate it to produce energy, the place is amazing. It is an icon in Singapore.",,
,,Love the view,5,,"Been there with my family.. relaxing place, nice and really love the view.. its so amazing place.. we鈥檙e looking forward to visit this place again..",,
,,Fantastic Experience,5,,"Out of all the attractions in Singapore, I would rate GBB in top 3. I visited the place in the evening, so I got the chance to see lightings and music too. However, before going here, one needs to keep in mind that there are two domes inside and both of them get closed by 8pm. Generally, Forest dome take much time as compared to Flower Dome. If you're planning to go in the evening, make sure to visit Marina Barrage after completing Domes. That place is super calm with not much of a crowd and also provides the view of entire city from a good height though not as high as Marina Bay Sands but I bet you will love it if you're more of a person who doesn't like much crowded places.Cheers",,
,,Please you should not miss out!,5,,"You can see all type of flora in there and the environment is comfortable. You will not feel hot though it's in the hot weather, because it's air-conditioning!",,
,,Man-made wonder,5,,"This futuristic garden is the epitome of wow factor. Engineering meets nature, such a marvel!
We got here in the afternoon and spend over 5 hours exploring. Views from the suspension bridge s breathtaking and the conservatories are simply amazing! The Christmas decorations are amazing, creating a dream city within.
There is lots to explore and thus dedicating two days is worthwhile.
Getting here is very easy, walk from the MRT station to the gardens is barely a few minutes. There are ample food options to keep taste buds satisfied.",,
,,Days break between flights,5,,"Had a 24 hour layover between flights so spent a few hours in Singapore. This was somewhere I had not been before and it did not dissapoint. Beautiful gardens well laid out with arrangements covering all areas of the world. Quite busy on my visit, could be because it had been wet that morning but as it is all contained in a giant greenhouse it didn't really matter. Highly recommended.",,
,,"Beautiful, relaxing, refreshing",4,,"All of the multiple gardens are gorgeous. Like all things in Singapore they are well maintained and continually updated. The orchids were my favorite. They are many different variety of flowers. You can spend a short time walking through each section or leisurely stroll through soaking in all the colors, scents. The cost is very reasonable and there are restroom facilities, an ATM, gift shop, and food court.",,
,,Impressive futurist garden/green project,5,,Fabulous place a must in Singapore with supermodern technique exciting architecture with environment thinking.Flowers plants treetopwalking in and out of superconstructions/ greenhouses. Don鈥檛 miss the lightshow at 07:45 pm! Five star attraction definitive !馃榾馃憤馃榾,,
,,Enjoyable,4,,"The Gardens are very extensive and have lots of park walkways to different features areas, all peaceful and well presented.
Great to get away from the hub of the city.
The water area which features fountains is great for the children and parents - cooling fountains are even great to watch.
The central focus is the super trees which provide access to a high level walkway and a sky bar.
Take lots to drink since on a hot day you can cover a lot of ground.

The stars are the Cloud Forrest and Inside Garden House domes which are breath taking.

Access to the park is free except there is a charge for access to the domes, walkway and tour buses around the park.

A must do experience especially the Cloud Forrest which is unique.",,
,,Futuristic garden tour,5,,"As. a free venue this was a great half day trip although you pay to access the flower dome and cloud forest it is still great value.
It gets more interesting after dark so good planning would be to arrive late afternoon and spend the time with great views in daylight and spectacular show after darkness starts to fall.
Not a difficult walk from the MRT but a few dollars will get you a buggy transit.
The cloud forest was closed for our visit but will tempt me back next time",,
,,Beautiful creation,5,,Visited the gardens recently and was impressed with the variety of fauna and Flora in one place. Very well laid out and well worth a visit. The orchids are very stunning. Try and time your visit so that you can see the gardens being lit up at 7pm which lends a magical air to the whole place.,,
,,A one of its kind place,5,,"One cannot explain this place until it is experienced by going there, a very unique place with quite a lot of options to spend the time, one should not miss the light show which happens every evening.",,
,,Beautiful place,5,,So loved gardens at the Bay and the light show in the evening was fantastic xx You have thought of everything to make this a lovely day/evening out and everyone who visits should come here.,,
,,Do not miss,5,,Allow 3 to 4 hours to visit. 28 dollars for adults for Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. Free to walk in the gardens. Take lift to top of Cloud Forest and walk down or use escalator. Each level has exhibits to see. Wonderful experience.,,
,,Really shows what can be achieved,5,,"If travellers do one thing while in Singapore, it should be to go and see the displays at Gardens by the Bay. The management of the two central attractions is superb and we were blown away by the display of global plantings.",,
,,Just beautiful,5,,Garden by the bay is a landmark of Singapore. It is one of the must do attraction that will not disappoint. It is beautiful and very well maintained. The small show in climate change is particularly interesting and eye-opening. Whoever travel to Singapore must go to garden by the bay.,,
,,early bird,5,,"get to the gardens when first open at 9am. The outside gardens are free and you pay to go into the air conditioned Domes/hot houses. By arriving early you miss the school groups/tourist groups so relatively quiet peaceful walk around both Domes. Wonderful plants and sculptures. Then go outside for walk around the many gardens. The MRT is located at gardens, we went from Clarke Quay to gardens on quick efficient train for AUS $.70 cents.great value.",,
,,Something for everyone,5,,"Serene, beautifully manicured gardens, by the marina, It is a feast of flowers, water, magnificent architecture, sculptures, water park, space age, techno trees, sound and light show, Bio-domes, street food court, and the Marina Bay Sands all in one marvellous package. It's the arts, it's science, it's entertainment, it's kid friendly, it's a simple walk in the park or it's wild and wonderful.
FANTASTIC!!!",,
,,Climate Control Oasis in Singapore,4,,Admission is not cheap but worth a visit. Plants from all over the world arranged by region. Impressive displays. The place is climate controlled. A nice relieve from the sweltering heat of Singapore. Expect to spend 2 to 3 hours here. The centerpiece Waterfall is amazing.,,
,,Visited the evening sound and lite show,4,,"We booked to watch the 1946hrs evening lite and sound show. It was enjoyable. The sound was really good, but the lite show needs some tweeks",,
,,Gorgeous Light- n Sound Show,5,,"daily at 7:45 pm and 8:45 pm. brilliant impression. we had 70 ties hits, daily changing program. stay at the ground and walk around. don't go up the treetop walk that time as you get sort of fixed there.",,
,,Night time sensation,5,,"Out of the world experience showcasing why Singapore is a world leader in architecture and climate initiatives.

Spent 3 hours doing the paid sections and stayed for the nightly lights and music show. Theme for November was Retro and the atmosphere was a treat for the senses. The dome gardens had a Xmas section which was nice.

The climate change and nature informative theater was moving and a great reminder of the fragility of nature and our impact on it.

All in all a place for people of all ages. Everyone can take away something out of this highly recommended experience.",,
,,Superfragilistic,5,,"What an investment in Mother Nature! Visit Cloud Forest and Flower Dome and feel humbled. Green is the breath of our blue planet. Singapore invests in life not only in business. And makes
it a success any how. Wow.
Stroll around and do not miss the OCBC Skywalk and the Supertrees.",,
,,Cloud Dome is a Must! - Hint A/C!,4,,A perfect escape from the heat and well worth the price of admission. More to come in this review ....,,
,,A must,5,,"Amazing place with plenty of stuff to do. Make sure to check: cloud forest, flowers dome and skywalk.",,
,,Stunning,5,,Stunning area to visit a must see on your visit to Singapore. The whole area will take you most of the day so plan ahead. Domes are expensive to enter but probably the same as London attractions.,,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,Quite a serene place.Manmade Natural Garden.one can spend already one and half hour observing the variety of flowers from across the world.Every flower I saw was new to me .Nothing what I saw before ever,,
,,"A must do, when you visit Singapore!",5,,If your in Singapore and you love flowers and plants! This is definitely the place to be! And it鈥檚 more than his price worth it!,,
,,Make sure everything is open,3,,Unfortunately the cloud dome was not open so we only had the flower dome which was OK but average compared to Kew Gardens. The high level walk was ok but rather short. Overall a bit overrated,,
,,The domes and super trees are incredible !,5,,"We visited the gardens early one afternoon, mid week, before the crowds descended about 4pm. The domed gardens are well worth the admission fee as is the super-tree walkway. We returned one evening to experience the super-trees light show which was incredible and free ! Singapore should be very proud of these garden ""creations"", they are art pieces and well worth visiting.",,
,,Green park with river view,5,,Large green garden with relaxing environment. Recommend to visit in the evening because the big signature tree will be lighted.,,
,,Exceptional Gardens,5,,"An impressive display of Olive trees, 馃尨 palm trees, succulents, and flowering plants all housed below the worlds largest greenhouse- great value S$18 entrance",,
,,Must-see in Siungapore,5,,"If you only have 1 day in Singapore, this is the activity you should do! Impressive, stunning, relaxing, beautiful. Surprisingly cool and fresh, not muggy, so a relief from the hot humid Singapore air. Best of all is the FREE musical light show in the Super Tree grove every evening. Just magical!",,
,,This Place are so Beautiful,5,,It was eye open when the first visit to Garden by the Bay. There are too many interesting and wonderful scene that can't describe using only words. Go experience yourself and you won't regret for sure!,,
,,Gardens By The Bay,5,,"Fantastic scenes .. variety of flowers in different shapes,colours and sizes.Artificial waterfall looks great. Both Domes have their unique design... Super Trees and light show is marvelous... NOT TO MISS BY ANY VISITOR.All my overseas relatives like Gardens By The Bay .... very much ... Thumbs Up ! Well Done to the maintenance team.",,
,,Very nice place but busy,4,,"I probably had my expectations too high for this place. First off, it was very, very busy. I assume it is like that every day but it may have been because the Christmas displays were up. The theme (this year?) was Tsum Tsum, which was everywhere.

I really appreciated how they interwove art within the exhibits and appreciated how the exhibits were broke down via region. What I wished was better was the flow (It seems that you have to go half way through, then sort of turn around to hit the other half before you exit). I also wish there was more information about each exhibit. I really wanted to know what some of the flowers were.

The exit leads you directly into the gift shop.",,
,,Wonderland,5,,"it's a must see tourist attraction it's free, accessible and a VERY BEAUTIFUL PLACE to visit. Specially the bar at the top of that gigantic tree.",,
,,Night and Day must visit,5,,The Gardens are beautiful during the day but at 7.45 at night they come alive with a musical experience that you shouldn't miss. A light show with a pumping beat.,,
,,must go attraction (free) in Singapore,5,,"accessible by public transport - Bayfront MRT Station (CE1/DT16), beautiful landscape and night entertainment, make a walk to satay by the bay and marina barage or to the hi-end shopping MBS.",,
,,Wonderful Garden,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is open daily. The outdoor gardens are free of charge. Entry to the two conservatories has admission fees (Flower Dome and Cloud Forest). Getting inside the dome 鈥?depending on the time of year 鈥?is thematically refreshed, whether for Chinese New Year, Christmas or hanami (cherry blossom) season. { based on my experience, April 2018 Tulips festival, Dec 2015 - Christmas Wonderland and lots of Poinsettia and Sept 2015- Orchids} The Garden is very child friendly, my nephew loves the water play area. And i do love Satay! so go to Satay by the Bay! You will surely enjoy roaming around and please don't miss the Tree Dancing Lights (7:45pm). Enjoy!",,
,,Wonderland!!!!!,5,,"WOW!!!!!!-------This was an amazing experience, like being in Avatar, what a wondrous, imaginative, beautiful and charming wonderland. We were truly stunned by the surreal almost alienesque feeling of standing under the giant trees, then came the light show------wow!! People young and old were just in awe of the coolness,kids,were,dancing us oldies were toe-tappin--to the old school tunes,what,a,groovy idea and really well done---and-FREEEE!!! nobody in Singapore rushes or is the least bit aggressive, there's just an easy calm of a well planned and orderly city that seems to run like clockwork, nothing is a hassle, and we felt safe the entire time we were there, I did not feel the need to shadow my kids, I felt they were 100% safe and we were just relaxed and enjoying the sights and lifestyle, the
gardens are so well maintained and set out,just a perfect spot for a twilight picnic. Definetely a must do on anyones list while in Singas",,
,,great place to hang out for nature and relaxation,5,,this place is beautiful and well organized. the admission is not that high and you need to have all the attraction around.,,
,,Gardens By the Bay,5,,An amazing experience of indoor flora and fauna in the most colourful way.... Air conditioned domes so that you don鈥檛 feel tired as this is quite a walk.Takes 3-4 hours easily to cover both the domes. The view at nighttime is beautiful when lights are on,,
,,Like a walk in the forest or a mountain within a City,4,,"A rural- like setting inside an ultra modern urban setting.
It鈥檚 like a stroll or a light gallivanting in a forest or a plateau in a mountain.
Quite amazing and interesting.
I made a copycat of the parabolic tree ( on its top ) on my roof deck to remind me of the Gardens by the bay after my first visit in Singapore way back in November 2012.",,
,,Beautiful Beautiful & Beautiful ..,5,,Beautiful place and well maintained. Natural beauty under a closed environment. Exceptional good. Must visit place in Singapore,,
,,Great Attraction,5,,We went to the Gardens late afternoon to see everything Lit up. The Gardens and Surroundings area was so Beautiful and Interesting. I wished My Pictures had come Out better to show how wonderful it was.,,
,,Highly recommend!,5,,We were touring Singapore and this was on our list and I am glad I took the tour. There is so much to see and we had so much fun.,,
,,Disappointing,3,,"A bit of an anti climax! Visit, only if you wish to say you have. Lights around trees choreographed to music.",,
,,Stunning,5,,Absolutely stunning scene at night. A definite a place to visit and is really good for children. You can spend a lot of time here,,
,,Wow! Singapore is greener yet!,5,,Amazing biospheres to enjoy! Evening light show of the super trees is worth staying for. We visited later in the afternoon when walking around is more temperature comfortable.,,
,,Lovely place to view,5,,We have just arrived into Singapore and took a taxi to the garden bay park it's amazing and it even had a light show going on. It's well worth a visit.,,
,,Top Gardens!,5,,"Singapore鈥檚 Gardens by the Bay, must surely rate as one of the City鈥檚 top attractions.
This cooled conservatory delightful atmosphere is a joy to behold. With plant life from around the world.
Explore the amazing plant scenes, see the misting cloud forest and flower dome. Above all don鈥檛 miss the OCBC Skyway , where at night, one can witness a spectacular light and sound show! Photography plus!
Quite a bit of walking, but a shuttle service is available.
Reasonable charges apply to GOTB and the Skyway.",,
,,Interesting,4,,"We are here in the rainy season. When it rains, the rooftop bar and Super tree walk close, and don't re-open until at least an hour after the rain stops. Yes, it's for safety (lots of lightning during the rain storms.) Still disappointing. The gardens themselves are free. You have to pay to go into the domes or take the Super tree walk. Be prepared to do a LOT of walking. If you're not very fit, you'd be wise to purchase the pass to ride the tram / shuttle.",,
,,wonderful waterfull,5,,a must to go and see beautiful orchids end other tropical plants end some good views. the walk down from the top is brathtaking,,
,,Peace and quiet,5,,Lovely area for a walk and to take in some fantastic views. I don't know much about the gardens themselves but it was a fantastic experience visiting. Satay at the Bay was a fantastic Hawker Center with lovely satays on the right as you enter.,,
,,Interesting,5,,Great way to spend a couple of hours enjoying the best of this nature enclosure Very interesting & the coolness was a relief,,
,,Spectacular,5,,"I must say, normally I've got pictures to share of each and every one of my visits, but this one I just wanted to take it all in.",,
,,Stunning - must do.,5,,"This was probably our favourite experience whilst in Singapore, most of the area is free to wander round with charges for Cloud forest and flower gardens, both on same ticket and definitely worth doing.
Cloud forest was excellent little bit like Eden Project in England with very interesting details regards history and biodiversity and how we鈥檙e damaging the planet. Very thought provoking.",,
,,Family,5,,"Visited last October. We are a family of 5 adults 3 kids ages 10,8 and 5 with my mommy who is 89 years old in a wheelchair. My mom loves the flowers and how they arranged it. And it is so PWD person with disability friendly. Even the kids loved it there our 5 years old had fun looking at the small statues hidden at the flowers like Winnie the Pooh. All in all we love it there.. at the souvenir section the cashier was rude. My sisters coins was mixed up SG dollars and MYR for we went to malaysia the day before. She won鈥檛 help with the coins and would say the line is long line is long, just 1 person behind her. Making my sister angry and did not buy the stuff. I hope all is well with all your future travels. Have fun in SG. For we had lots of fun.",,
,,Liked it,4,,"It was my second visit to GBB. Not much has changed but with children I enjoyed more this time.

Both flowerdome and cloud domes are very good and informative.They also show a small documentary on environment in forest dome.

I visited in morning both time so I could not see evenilng light show which is said to be very good.",,
,,A must visit for all,4,,"Gardens by the bay is a must
Visit for all those who love gardens and those who don鈥檛 as well. The gardens are beautifully laid out with something different to see at every turn. The flower dome is my favorite place to go to. It is well maintained and so peaceful. The super tree groves come alive at night with the lights and music show. This should not be missed. The gardens are great place to unwind and get away from the city.",,
,,Fantastic experience,5,,"The whole gardens complex is incredibly well maintained and beautiful. Highlights are the 鈥渢rees鈥?and the two indoor domes - especially the cloud forest which is fantastic. Wish we could have spent longer there and explored more, but time didn鈥檛 allow...",,
,,This is a must see,5,,Really beautiful with lots of paths to stroll along. At night everything in beautifully lit up. There is a music a light show in the evening,,
,,A very different neat area,4,,"A large area to walk around, can be hot - some shade. Not much cover when it rains. Always an enjoyable area to walk around, been here before and always revisit. Impressive plantings of large trees and shrubs which have developed over the years.",,
,,Spectacular,5,,Quite simply spectacular! Staff very helpful and friendly . Food courts very good and good value for money.,,
,,Man made beautiful structures with plethora of plants,5,,"Man made beautiful structures with plethora of plants and flowers. A must visit place in Singapore. We spent a whole day out there and kids loved it. If you are in rush, it can be finished in a couple of hours also.
You can see plants and flowers from all over the word out there. Cloud forest is awesome with the artificial waterfall.
Don't miss the 15 min light and music show at 7:45
Reaching there is easy by MRT. Bayfront is the nearest MRT station.",,
,,Mrs,3,,"I visited last night with my husband, and was very disappointed in it, after all the nice restaurants in Singapore we鈥檝e been to, that was the worst, it鈥檚 in great need of a make over. I expected a lot better standards of where it was positioned. I wouldn鈥檛 recommend it to my friends.",,
,,Unbelievable,5,,These gardens are unbelievably a must to have a look at if you are visiting. Presentation of the flowers are great. Walking over the bridges the view was great.,,
,,Great Selection of light and lamps,5,,"We were looking for a great truck light for our home, and most designs I saw in other shops did not really catch my drift. I found the one here, and the one who assisted us was very helpful. Great products, great service.",,
,,10 stars if I could,5,,"Walked from our hotel to this amazing garden , well worth the 33 degrees heat.
It cost 56 Singapore dollars to get us both in and it was worth every cent.. it was so chilled out plenty of room to look at all the plants and trees, we spent a hour in each of the domes one dome is for flowers.. but my favourite was the forest dome totally amazing,",,
,,Flower dome is wonderful,5,,"Visited as part of cruise tour so didn鈥檛 have a huge amount of time. That said, it was very impressive and very well presented. A huge array of plants and flowers from all parts of the world - all grown at 28 deg C.",,
,,"Amazing space, photography playground",5,,"Beautifully laid out gardens, which are free. Then there are the two domes and the trees.
The two climate domes are pay to enter but value for money and, if you visit Singapore again can be revisited as they have changing elements.
The grove of future trees are becoming a symbol for Singapore and as amazing close up as from a distance.
If you are a photographer you鈥檒l have to set time aside. Besides the plant life there鈥檚 the architecture.",,
,,I was surprised,4,,I was surprised how much I enjoyed the Cloud Dome... Not so much the Flower Dome where weird Christmas decorations didn't even appeal to the hoards of kids... What were those characters?,,
,,Real life Pandora,5,,"The Gardens by the bay are absolutely amazing. You need a full day to visit everything, don't only go to the domes, there are much more gardens around for free.",,
,,Nice array of flower arrangements,4,,Nice and peaceful if it is not noisy. The beautiful layout and environment is often disturbed by overly loud behaviours and selfie enthusiasts.,,
,,Pretty,4,,We came here twice. Once to visit the 2 attractions (paid for) and once in an evening to visit the free light show. Really pretty through and staff were great and really helpful. Clean facilities. Light show was fun to watch. The room that educates on the extinction and pollution of the world really got to me. Worth a visit.,,
,,Wow!,5,,"It鈥檚 a must see and great experience despite having to push a pram around, should be noted that it鈥檚 relative pram friendly and the views and things to photograph is specular and abundant. Highly recommend, very unique attraction.",,
,,!!!,5,,The best part of Singapore. Its so great there. I prefered visiting the gardens during the day - there was no crowd and the views from upper floor (8sgd) was amazing,,
,,A must visit in Singapore,5,,"Visit to Cloud Forest is a must do here. Cloud walk, Lost world in the dome, Super trees & lights and sound show at Super Trees will take you to a different world.",,
,,Walk in Garden jungle,5,,"Fanatastic walk through all the various plants, flowers, fotenes, houses and it was like walking in the jungle or rain forrest.",,
,,A wonderful experience for all ages.,5,,"This exceeded all my expectations, and was attractive, impressive and informative. Really a must-see experience in Singapore and not one to be missed. You should note that it's quite cool inside the Cloud Dome, and that an extra layer of clothing is advisable.",,
,,Got to be one of the modern wonders of the world,5,,These garden would have to be the modern equivalent of the ancient gardens of Babylon. These are just amazing. There is an entry fee to the two conservatories of $28 SG which is well worth it. The range of plants is just extraordinary as are the domes themslves. They are both very popular and you will need a fair bit of time to fully appreciate them. The rest of the gardens are free to enter. We went late afternoon and saw them in the light as well as in darkness - the super tree grove is justt stunnning at night,,
,,Christmas Wonderland at Gardens by the bay,4,,I recommend to go here during Dec as they have a christmas wonderland where they will have a lightshow and play christmas songs.Nice christmas decorations too,,
,,Must See in Singapore,5,,"We always love going to the Botanic gardens when away and visited those in Singapore (which were excellent). We then decided to visit Gardens by the Bay, expecting it to be a bit of fun but nothing much in terms of the botanicals side. To be fair, if you simply looked round the outdoor gardens, this would be true - the iconic tree structures are stunning and the trunks are all plant walls, but it's more the novelty and the design that's interesting; the heritage gardens and other small gardens are showing signs of neglect (assumption being that most guests are simply interested in the trees and the dome so they're not maintaining the smaller gardens). Regardless, the mini gardens are not worth specifically visiting, but the domes were something else altogether. The flower dome we spent hours in wandering around the meticulously maintained plants. The other dome was a huge plant wall which is all about the mass of the structure and the overall impression of the plants but is no less breathtaking.

A few tips: the gardens are free other than the domes, but those are well worth the money. The domes are better viewed during the day but the trees have a night time light show so consider two visits. There is a hawker centre there doing good, reasonable value food, but it's a bit off the main route. The domes are temperature controlled so a welcome respite on a hot day.",,
,,Enjoyed the kids play areas the most,4,,The kids play areas have free water fountains where the kids can enjoy in swim wear. They also have a small adventure trail for kids aged 5 years to 12 years.,,
,,A highly recommended attraction,5,,"We visited the Gardens by the Bay one afternoon, It is comprised of four parts. The first part is a series of outdoor gardens which I believe are free. One of the outdoor areas was set up for young children. The second part is called the Cloud Forest, which is an enclosed area designed to be like a rain forest. The third part is the Flower dome, which is also enclosed and designed to be an indoor garden. The fourth part is an elevated walkway in the outdoor garden in the Supertree area. Being covered, both the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome are great to visit on rainy days. In addition, there is a 15 minute sound and light show in the outdoor garden at 7:45 and 8:45 (I believe - please check the web site for details) which we stayed to see. It is easy to spend a few hours here. The Cloud Forest is a must see. The Flower Dome was good but not exceptional. The outdoor gardens are nice but we really liked the ""Supertrees"" where the sound and light show is held. These are large structures made to look like trees, with colored lights. The sound show was very good even if only 15 minutes long. There is a lot of seating in the Supertree area where it is held. We didn't need to get there more than 10 minutes before the show started to get a good seat. However, this was the ""off season"" and it may be more crowded in other months. Tickets can be purchased in advance at a discount from tour companies.",,
,,Go for the experience,4,,"Visited the two indoor domes and it was beautiful. The cloud forest was simply gorgeous and is a must, especially for aesthetic pictures.",,
,,Great outdoor activity without suffering in the heat,4,,"This was a great half day activity, good to be 'outside' but still enjoy the air conditioning. There is a fully accessible path, I was able to push a pram easily around. The Christmas display in the flower dome helped keep my young children entertained. Also the varieties of plants is amazing! The Mist dome is beautiful.

It was a bit of a walk from the MRT station we got off and due to garden works we missed walking through the garden to get to the domes. But in general we loved it.",,
,,"Flower dome is horrible, cloud forest is a must see",5,,"We got a ticket to both domes and saw the flower dome first. It is basically a big garden with some plants from all over the world. Wet did not find it interesting at all, although it is good for taking pictures for phone wallpapers (the plants). I wouldn't recommend spending your money on that.

Instead, go to cloud forest. I literally don't have the words to describe how beautiful it is. Not only is there the garden type part, there is a whole exhibit on climate change and pollution which made many people cry. Really touching.",,
,,Great place to go if its raining!,5,,Beautiful gardens with two huge atriums; one features a waterfall with circular walkways taking you through the spectacular displays of trees and flowers. Outside the gardens are equally lovely and we especially liked the street food area - a great place for lunch with a a wide choice. Look for the huge baby sculpture in the gardens and spot how it appears to float on air.,,
,,"Amazing garden, man-made wonder",5,,"The main attractions are the two domes, amazing variety of plants and mesmerising placed. The towers are not that great. Need at least half a day to go through",,
,,Wondeful green oasis,5,,"This was the first place we ventured to in Singapore, fresh off our 13 hour flight and it was so peaceful but invigorating. It's full of beautiful varieties of flora and displays to take in. If you don't want to pay for the Skywalk, Cloud forest or flower dome, you can really enjoy yourself for free taking in the different outdoor areas. The supertrees are amazing to see and going back at night is a must, the light show is fantastic.",,
,,Singaporean great attraction,5,,The Gardens by the Bay was the highlight of our trip. It was amazing to see all the different flora in the two different air condition domes. Make sure to see the light show. The music was great.,,
,,Loved this!,5,,"I only had a couple of hours to see something of Singapore in one evening before my flight ... so I headed here, to the music and lights show in Supertree Grove. Oh my goodness! I loved it so much, I stayed for the second show. Even if you have time to see nothing else, catch the light show - it's amazing.",,
,,Great experience!,4,,"We had a couple of hours to fill and had an enjoyable visit here. It is especially good for those who love gardens. The displays of orchids and other tropical plants are outstanding, particularly in the Cloud Walk Dome. One of the advantages is that it is possible to visit the Garden (Domes) without getting wet when it is raining (which it regularly does in Singapore). I am in a wheelchair and the Domes are fully accessible for the disabled.",,
,,Amazing architecture!,5,,"Come here to enjoy the sunrise, or just take a walk around the whole garden to see the massive supertrees. If time and budget allow, do head in to visit the domes too. It can get a bit chilly inside.",,
,,Awesome!!,5,,Nice place to be!! The view is breathtaking and well done singapore.... loveeeeeeeeeeee to be here again real soon!!!!,,
,,Make it a day trip,5,,"Wow! Well worth the visit, these gardens are stunning and have something for everyone. You can easily make this a free day out or spend the cash to see the domes & do the skywalk. If you are going to pay to see only one of the domes, I recommend the cloud forest over the flower garden. Don't miss the free light show at night. Enjoy!",,
,,Nice gardens and show,5,,I鈥檝e been in Gardens by the Bay more tran once. I liked walking the gardens in the afternoon and stay to enjoy the light show in the late afternoon. Beautiful place.,,
,,Wow,4,,The bay in the mid of glorious place...sorrounded by tall buildings...green and clean...wow Singapore...coming from most polluted part of the world I.e. from Delhi to such a clean and green point has really been memorable...,,
,,Great Day Out,5,,Great place to wonder around on a nice day. Supertree Grove was amazing and there's a large choice of places to get food or snacks from,,
,,STUNNING,5,,"Well worth a visit, for young and old alike. We went twice, Once during the day and then again on another day for the light show at night. That was quite a spectacle.
It was very hot and humid, so we took advantage of the shuttle to get from one place to another.
The Flower Dome had some very special displays of orchids, but the highlight of the visit was the Forest Dome - amazing!",,
,,Miracle in Singapore,5,,This is a place I never miss whenever I visit Singapore. It is a man-made Mediterranian garden in tropical Singapore. It is always a moment of reflection inside the dome while watching pouring rains outside the dome. Thank Singapore for making this wonderful garden!,,
,,Amazing,4,,The visit to gbb was memorable.Needs a Full day to explore all parts of the gardens. One should not miss evening lights,,
,,Simply Mesmerizing!!!,5,,"Visit this splendid place to witness an amalgamation of modern day architecture and nature that is soothing to your eyes and senses. Capture the view of the Merlion, Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore skyline, the Helix bridge, the OCBC skyway, the art and science museum, the flyer and the super tree grooves and much more all at this spot.
Visit the flower dome which is an artificial greenhouse housing flowers of different region and species under one roof. Similarly, the cloud forest is a closed, cold, misty artificial mountain covered in dense vegetation and rare plants.
The Super Tree Groove  offers a light show at 7.45 PM and 8.45 PM. This is also called as the Garden Rhapsody.  Enjoy the lights shining at these tall tree like structures covered in orchids, ferns and other tropical plants and groove to the music played. You can also take a walk through the OCBC skyway which is a walkway through the super tree grooves offering you stunning views of the garden.",,
,,Superb learning experience at gardens by the bay,5,,"Fascinated with Beautiful flowers, plants and ambience. Very friendly staff as well. Probably need more eateries and better signages from marina bay sands.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay,4,,Don't miss the show in the evening the laser lights are spectacular. The music they pick to go with it certainly fits it all,,
,,Beautiful but check the active hours before going there,3,,"It was written that it's open til 2AM but when I went there at 12 AM, it was open but was inactive and the place was too dark to even walk around. I came back without seeing anything.",,
,,Big garden in the middle of he city,5,,"It鈥檚 a must to come to see this place! We had enjoyed like a children, I think is better to go in the evening to see the sunset!
You can enter to the garden for free however, if you would like to go to the skyway you need to pay $8 per adult. Also you can visit the flower dome and the cloud forest and you can pay for both $28 per adult! Highly recommended.
There is also a possibility to go by golf car across the park for $3 per adult",,
,,Beautiful surroundd,5,,This place is just beautiful. The domes were excellent. The sky walk was incredible. The light show was amazing.,,
,,"Oh my, what a fabulous experience",5,,Wow just wow. We loved it here. Nor much more to say really but if we visit Singapore again we would certainly return. I don鈥檛 have any photos as I didn鈥檛 want to miss a thing,,
,,This destination is really incredible. Many places to visit and hang our with friends.,5,,"Love the beauty of this garden and fall in love with the music and lighting performance. Also, there are so many kinds of flowers and plants to explore. Worth money and worth time",,
,,Fresh concept,5,,"Great job building a fresh concept, very good place for child education. Nice outline from day till night",,
,,Just awesome!,5,,Beautiful gardens and great views! Amazing light show at the treetops everyday at 7h45pm and 8h45pm. Do not miss this show if you are in Singapore!,,
,,Heaven for flower lovers,5,,"Best place for flower lovers, great variety of flowers to see both natural and artificial, need a whole day to explore the place, attractions for day and night also..",,
,,"Amazing Gardens, absolutely jaw dropping",5,,While we were in Singapore we visited the gardens. Our family consisting of 2 kids and extended family all enjoyed the day thoroughly. Unfortunately we did not stay for the night lights which I really regret. The food on offer at the kiosk was cheap but there was not a lot of choice. The artwork littered throughout the gardens is incredible and worth seeing alone. For all of us it was very educational and left a positive impact on the kids. Highly recommended for any family.,,
,,Good Services,3,,Little incident happened to my visit but when we seek help from the service staff walking around the flower dome. Great support was given.,,
,,charge your camera batteries,5,,"If you only have time to do one thing in Singapore do this. The waterfall dome is outstanding and amazing, the light show in the evening is incredible and beautiful. We saw the flower dome at night time, which was great, but I think it would be better in the daytime. The lights on the Christmas display made for some fantastic night shots. To just walk around the gardens without the domes is free and a terrific thing to do. It is easy to get there from Bayview MRT(train) station (well sign posted). If you go to the light show be aware that there is also another light show (Spectra) at 8pm or 9pm to see from the marina Plaza on the promenade (in front of the Marina Bay Sands)which is also beautiful and spectacular . This show uses light and water.",,
,,Must see!,5,,Must see when visiting Singapore. Something you will never see anywhere else. We didn't do the sky walk but visited the bar on top of the gardens.,,
,,Great Visit,4,,"First time to gardens by the bay and was amazed by the architecture and growing/maintaining of the flowers and plants in the dome & forest. The dome & forest are both air-conditioned and thus it is very cooling and enjoyable for a hot & humid SG weather. And there are varieties of plants and flowers to view & phototaking. Apart from the crowd, overall it is a nice visit.",,
,,Amazing gardens with two world-class conservatores,5,,"The garden by itself is free of charge. This is a repeated scene in many venues in Singapore, such as the Botanic Garden, which is a statement to the social benefit of the country. The garden has a collection of 18 'Supertrees', which are gigantic metal structures that resemble trees. For a nominal fee one can walk above several of the trees. The two conservatories, named Cloud Forest and Flower Dome, are simply one-of-the-kind. The collection and the design are so unique with numerous plant species and features. This is definitively one place to visit when in Singapore.",,
,,Soooo cooool,5,,"Came here in the evening for the music show at 8.45. It was a really nice time, lovely light show, quite many people but the park is huge, so you can have your spot.",,
,,Fantastic place,4,,"an Amazing place where you can observe how can people create an artificial world which seems real. A lot of envirnments in a structured place where you can see a lot of kind of vegetables, flowers, trees. It is fantastic how they where able to support technically the life of the organism you can see. A plece to visit!",,
,,Truly incredible..a MUST see,5,,"n a recent family visit to Singapore this was definitely on our list of places to visit. The structure is massive and so iconic for Singapore it is hard to miss, dominating the city. It is worth visiting just to see the unreal architecture and the amazing views.It is easily accessible by MRT to MarinaBay station.

The glasshouses are truly incredible and are cavernous inside with a vast range of global flora and fauna with a 10 storey waterfall the centrepiece of the bigger of the two glasshouses.

Equally it plays a key part in the Light show in the Bay so it is amazing to see at night as well. A must visit in Singapore to sample the atmosphere and architecture. It is also a great place just to take a walk and enjoy the green space away from the hustle of the main city.",,
,,A must see,5,,"Walked around the gardens by the bay in day time. Had we been in Singapore for longer, would certainly have liked to go back at night to see the lights. Well worth a visit.",,
,,A must if u like flowers,4,,Try to go towards the end of the day so u can get ur hand stamped and go in when it gets dark... it definitely has some unique plants - flowers - trees,,
,,Beautiful,5,,Its a very beautiful place. Sky bridge will only be open for visitors only if the weather condition is good.,,
,,Go at night!,5,,"The lights of the garden are spectacular at night. It is not very big but definitely worth it, especially as it is free!",,
,,Amazing,5,,This is a must if you are visiting Singapore. Make sure you have plenty of space on your camera for this place,,
,,Nice attraction,5,,"We went for a afternoon trip to Gardens by the Bay, Singapore. Very nice gardens, definitely worth the visit!",,
,,DON'T MISS THIS INCREDIBLE DISPALY,5,,"Whether you like gardens or not, don't miss the Gardens By The Bay in Singapore. The display is magical and very inspiring. Such a vast array of plants from around the world, giving visitors an insight as to what one can do with a garden back home even on a small budget. The themes that are around every corner and the views of Singapore from inside the dome are incredible. DO IT !!!!!",,
,,Enjoyable time,5,,"I always enjoy visiting the two domes. This is probably the best place in the whole of Singapore to sit down and read a book. The flower dome is perfect for this with the controlled temperature, fragrance of flowers and its overall ambiance.

The cloud forest, on the other hand, has a lot more walking to do. The waterfall is cool to look at but it is also a lot noisier with the incessant splattering of water.

For people who like taking instragrammable photos, this is a must visit in Singapore.",,
,,A must visit place,5,,Amazing place with full of natural beauty.Very well maintained. Must go with pleanty of time at your disposal. Lots and lots of photo ops. Children would love it too.,,
,,Amazing!!!,5,,Such a beautiful and iconic hotel. Perfect for any type of travelers. Lots to see and do close by. Staff was excellent. Really nothing negative to say. We had an amazing experience.,,
,,Spectacular place,5,,"We visited the gardens in the day and then returned at night time to watch the light show. Getting there is very easy, MRT station Bayfront exit B. You can take a shuttle bus for few dollars (3min drive) to the visitor centre. We thoroughly enjoyed the day trip when we visited the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome. For only 28 Singaporean dollars you get a ticket to visit both domes. Both are air conditioned so it鈥檚 an enjoyable experience even in the heat of the day. Last admission is 8pm. You鈥檒l get a stamp at the exit so you can visit again in the same day should you wish to. The super trees can be seen in the Silver and Golden Gardens as well as in the Super tree Grove. That鈥檚 where the light show is. Start is every day at 7:45pm and 8:45pm. It鈥檚 great fun, visually and musically, too. Top attraction well worth the visit.",,
,,"A chance to wander and relax, or to be excited",5,,"The Gardens are larger and varied, with something for everybody. For those who want to pay, there are the two conservatories, the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest, and the sky walkway amount the gigantic artificial trees, but many of the best things are free, especially the light show twice every evening - which should not be missed. Well worth the experience.",,
,,Contemporary idea of the garden of the future,4,,"This parc with its vegetation is definitely a nice place for a walk. The super trees structures are stunning sculptures that really define the skyline of the parc.

Visit the two domes : one recreate the flowers and plants gardens of the most famous climat zone of the world and the other one held an artificial misty mountain with a rainforest. Warning it can be easily crowded, take your time.",,
,,Amazing Gardens,5,,"Nice gardens in Singapore - although it is man-made, I would proudly proclaim it the most spectacular garden in Singapore. It looks nice from any angle, day or night. In the day, the sheer amount of green makes viewing the gardens pleasant to the eyes, and at night, the lights emitted by the supertrees makes the gardens look like a lively one that never sleeps. The conservatories were cooling and I learnt a lot from the conservatories, such as the many different species of flowers in the flower dome and the geography behind the water cycle in the cloud forests. A wide range of flora and eye-catching flowers with vivid colors. For those who a hungry a meal at Satay by the Bay is recommended, and although their prices can be slightly higher than the regular hawker centre/food court in Singapore, it is definitely cheaper than most of the restaurants in the city area. It is a short 5-minute walk from the Marina Bay Sands Hotel where we stayed, and an even shorter walk from the Bayfront MRT Station (through the underpass).",,
,,Cloud forest was brilliant,5,,"Visited the gardens on my one day off ... worth it! The garden with the waterfall was mesmerising, well organised and got you out of the heat of the day.
Something unique! Would recommend if you like all things - nature!
I did got to the flower gardens as well - disappointing tbh. I wouldn鈥檛 go for both again.",,
,,So good visited twice,5,,"This is a must if you are in Singapore, brilliant gardens , easy acess, well designed /organised ,we went during the day which was great then went back on the evening to see the trees light up and see the rhapsody show at 7:45 ..... absolutely amazing , a definite must , the music is so apt for the scene, lots of people dancing around such a great fun time for all ages, then it all stops and everyone goes on about their business so surreal. The skyline walk way is also lit up and you can see for miles , lots of food courts etc should you wish to eat or just have a light snack , entrance is free to the gardens",,
,,one of the top things you should do,5,,if you go in day light you can see the trees and flowers colors it is a very big place you should wear a comfort shoebas u will walk alot if you go at night you will see the gardens lights and the tree music show,,
,,Take a trip after dark,5,,"Fascinating place at day time, but even better in the evening. The lightning give an extra experience",,
,,Great Experience,5,,There is a lot to see and do at the Marina Bay sands. A great place for iconic pictures among other things.,,
,,Wide variety of flower under one roof.,5,,"With a wide of variety of flowers and shrubs under one roof from different continents. The environment is controlled one.The temperature inside the Glass dome is maintained @15-20 deg C, some of you may feel cold. So please carry Jacket or sweaters.",,
,,Short break visit,3,,Worth a visit to escape the heat and relax a bit. Well organised and very well maintained but it will only take you about half an hour to see everything.,,
,,Loved loved loved it,5,,"We visited the flower and cloud domes where I took photos of all the flowers and my husband took photos of all the quirky exhibits. There was a lot for both of us to see in the flower dome. The cloud done had the tallest waterfall and you made your way up and walked down. It was very well done, to see a rainforest indoors. They are very cleaver how the move large numbers of people through with out a congestion, except the gift shop.

We went late in the afternoon and waited for the night light show. I recommend to get in early, we waited an hour just to keep our seats. Even still people were trying to sit on me.",,
,,You really have to go if you visit SIngapore,4,,"If you're a nature or architecture lover then go visit.
A lot of the plants can be seen in many gardens globally but the displays including tribal and modern artworks and are very impressive.
I probably didn't make the most of my trip there as I had been walking around/seeing a lot of stuff beforehand and this was the last on my agenda in the afternoon.

You can wander over the bridge to catch the MRT underneath the Marina Bay Shopping centre

I'm thinking it would probably be a lot more spectacular at night when the lights are on too",,
,,Cross Continent Garden in the city,5,,"The garden held by season with multiple themes, the plants are cross continent around globe. You can visit multiple time to check out the green plant around the world in the Garden by the Bay. Since the Garden located in the city, it was so accessible amd convenient for visitors especially tourist. On top of the Garden there are events held at the evening such as open concert at green field with food trunk and beer. It is a good day trip for family and solo traveller. By the way, check out online ticket for better rate.",,
,,Nice place - lovely,5,,"Visited Gardens by the Bay multiple times during by vacation in Singapore. Way back, I had visited Singapore in 2006 but at that time, Gardens by the Bay wasn't there. Absolutely loved the Gardens - or, garden complex.

Supertree Grove, OCBC Skyway, Silver Garden, Indoor Conservatoires, the Lake, the bridges are all sights to see. Heritage Gardens are another lovely attraction there. There are 4 such gardens - Indian, Malay, Colonial and one another. At the colonial garden which mostly revolves around spices, one can smell the spices, too.

Also visited Cloud Forest and Flower Dome, alongside the Supertree Grove, OCBC Skyway, the bridges and the lake. All the attractions are worth visiting, and many of these are free.

Not only garden enthusiasts, all must visit here for a memorable time.",,
,,Nice for a walk through,5,,"It's like a small garden with lights everywhere, romantic and not too touristy, we were surprised. There was also a bar we didn't know about but it was not impossible to get up.",,
,,Simply Beautiful,5,,Just an amazing place and deserves to be among the top ranking attractions. Plenty to see and do for the whole family. The best time to visit the place is probably in the evening when the supertrees are lighted up. The two domes are the other main attraction of the place that should not be missed. They are educational and also great escape from the tropical humidity.,,
,,Fabulous Day Out,5,,Great day and unbelievable value to visit both conservatories. Well laid out and so much to see. It鈥檚 a must do when in Singapore.,,
,,Explore The View,5,,When I was at Marina Bay Sand I was able to walk around and visit Gardens by the Bay. Nice place to visit and enjoy the view from many cafe and bar se rounding. Singapore has many attractions and will never be behind other country as they are very innovative with great maintenance. So Explore The View...,,
,,Fun outdoor activity,4,,When for the super tree grove light show and cloud forest. Definitely come before sundown so you can experience it during the day and at night to see the show. It鈥檚 7:45pm and 8:45pm,,
,,Loved it,5,,"Cloud forest is a must visit. Awesome experience. The flower dome is very nice too. But if there is time limitation, I wouldn鈥檛 mind giving it a miss. The show at the super tree was amazing too. We watched it twice...once from the gardens (you can lie down and relax as you watch the show) and second time from the skywalk. We had booked our tickets in advance.Be sure to join the line around 30-45 minutes before the show time, so that you can be on the skywalk at the time of the show.",,
,,Must visit for garden enthusiasts,4,,"We visited the gardens in the evening. Spent around 3-4 hours visiting the various regions within the garden. The Flower Dome is a must visit. The varied arrangements within were very aesthetically done. SuperTree Grove was good to look at from far off.
The Cloud forest was a novel experience. Must be seen for its unique set up
The walk around Bay Gardens itself is very relaxing and provides many suitable spots for good photography.
Was liked by both kids and senior citizens in the family.",,
,,amazing garden!,5,,"its highly recommended while you visit Singapore. there are plenty of flowers around the world. it so soothing and refreshing your eyes, and instagramable. Don't forget to visit cloud forest also. i really loved this place.",,
,,Pleasant stroll,5,,"Once we found out way across from the Marina Bay Sands Skypark the gardens were really good to walk through, we didn鈥檛 go into any of the houses but we did a loop round to the Helix bridge and across the the 2 permanent sections of the Formula 1 circuit",,
,,Pleasant stroll,5,,"Once we found out way across from the Marina Bay Sands Skypark the gardens were really good to walk through, we didn鈥檛 go into any of the houses but we did a loop round to the Helix bridge and across the the 2 permanent sections of the Formula 1 circuit",,
,,More than worth it.,5,,"All I can say is WOW. Singapore certainly knows how to do things. This would have to be the most amazing gardens I have ever been to. Go, you will not be disappointed.",,
,,Singapore icon,5,,"If you have any spare time and would like to get some exercise and fresh air then right near the city centre and Marina Bay Sands are these lovely modern gardens. Easily accessible with generous pathways, resting places and a variety of plant varieties. In addition you can climb up and walk around the elevate structures if you fancy that.",,
,,Must Visit,5,,"Good Experience , i have been to this place twice and feel like going again, one of the best tourist attraction. we were lucky to see the cloud formation happen in the dome.",,
,,Must visit,4,,"If you're a tourist, definitely visit the Flower Dome and the Forest Dome. Follow that with a walk around the surrounding gardens in the evening around the Marina Bay Sands.",,
,,Just Spectacular,5,,"Absolutely amazing experience visiting the Gardens By the Bay. We actually went during the day as we had dinner plans, and it was amazing to see all the expertly cared for and carefully maintained plants and flowers - especially the orchids. Just spectacular.

Definitely worth paying the extra $$ to walk along the Skyway, you get an amazing view across Singapore and the gardens. Take your time looking through the flower dome and cloud forrest - it's worth it.

We also walked to Satay by the Bay, which was well worth it! Definitely recommend a visit here for friendly bbq-ed satay!",,
,,Just WOW !!,5,,"A fantastic place and amazing experience. This place is beautiful and serene. Just remember to carry a jacket or sweater especially for kids because the AC is set really low !!
They have the Christmas decorations in place right now and everyone is busy taking photos all the time.You need atleast 3 hours to fully experience the place.
They have free WiFi inside the domes.
If you want some coffee during your visit please DO NOT visit the McDonalds outlet. The lady at the coffee counter is very very slow will take atleast 10 minutes to serve your order even if you are just 3rd in the queue.",,
,,My favourite place in Singapore,5,,"Incredibly beautiful place, great for walking around in the evening. You can pay to visit the two greenhouses, but walking around outside is completely free. Very peaceful walking beside the river, and you can get some great food at Satay by the Bay. There's even a chance of seeing some otters.",,
,,Magical,5,,Super cool park to walk around in. The trees are lit at night with light shows at different times. Go to the rooftop bar and restaurant (Supertree by Indochine) to get an amazing view of the park as well as the marina (the marina bay sands hotel and the Singapore flyer),,
,,Nice View,5,,"As others who take picture at this place, so were we 馃ぃ I think this is one of the sightseeing place you should go, especially in night time when all the lights already on",,
,,Great place,5,,Unbelievable spectacular place. Great light Show with music in the evening. Really worth to visit. Entrance for most areas is free.,,
,,Impressive but pricey,4,,"This is quite a long walk from the nominal MRT subway stop. Unbelievably, the developer did not provide an escalator at the Gardens subway exit-you climb three flights of stairs. There is a small, over-used handicapped elevator. Once you get into the heat aboveground, it's another hike to the $3 for-the-day shuttle trams. Or you can walk a mile. All of the outdoor attractions are free to all, if you can handle the sun and heat. But the two spectacularly large greenhouses, Cloud Forest (the better of the two) and Flower Dome are SD$30 for non-citizen adults. (10% discount for Singapore Air customers.) Despite literature mentions of Mediterranean climate in the Flower Dome, both greenhouses are superbly air conditioned, and were the coolest interiors we found during our short visit to Singapore.

Cloud Forest is a very theatrical, intensely planted and well-cared-for pile of tropical flora. It was a huge cross between Longwood Gardens, Disneyland, and a good Science Museum. The Flower Dome was also very big, but a tamer succession of well-lit geographical regions and collections of species. Cloud Forest had a first-rate temporary show of ""Orchids of the Andes"" (although the Inca stonework and miniature llamas were silly), while Flower Dome had a huge, horrible (for us) Disney-product poinsettia and Christmas-themed seasonal display. We spent much more time in the Cloud Forest, and enjoyed it. We got our hands stamped to exit and reenter after an overpriced captive-customer lunch at one of the cheaper looking places, Bakerzin. We two divided a one-person $15 chicken cutlet sandwich with fries, while I had a $12 pint (!) of Tiger beer. Her iced tap (""regular"") water was $0.50.

We avoided the shuttle tram fee by taking a cab from our hotel, for an amazing $6. On the way back, we learned (truthfully) that there's a $3 toll and $3 out-of-CBD fee, so the return fare was $12. I don't know why the first driver didn't charge them.

One more slam: The day before, entirely on foot, we were turned away from the fully-booked fine-dining in the Flower Dome, ""Pollen."" We unwisely followed a few official ""MRT Station"" signs, only to discover that they were a scheme to encourage one-way pedestrian traffic and decrease crowding close to The Gardens. This added 1/4 mile to our subway return!",,
,,Fantastic,5,,Great place to see loads of different plants and to enjoy the Gardens grounds. The waterpark play area is awesome with children. And the food and dining options are great. An awesome day out with family.,,
,,Plan your visit as the place is huge,4,,"If you are visiting as a tourist, you might want to plan your visit carefully. The place is huge and it will tire you up if you do not know where you are going. If you are with kids, I would suggest you to take a cab to go here. You can stop at the main entrance. From there you can take a free shuttle to take you around the garden. The main attractions here are the super tree where you can go up in some of them and also the two domes, flower comes and forest dome. The gardens are free but the domes are not. If you only have a short time, best is to go to the domes directly.",,
,,An unique one-of-a-kind visit,4,,We visited the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest Dome on a Saturday. It was quite crowded and numerous visitors were taking photos. It's quite an interesting experience where you can see different flowers from other countries and the cool climate maintained in the Dome is a welcome change from the humid weather outside. Bring a light jacket if you're from the tropics. The Super-Tree structure is rather majestic and reminds me of a scene from Avatar. The best time to visit should be in the evening when there is a laser light show at the Super-Tree. Definitely a must-see !,,
,,Worth a visit and at least 2 hours,5,,Fascinating area to walk around and admire. Not sure the 2 buildings with paid entrance or the elevated walkway are worth it. The child play area is worth visiting for everyone.,,
,,Light show fantastic,5,,"We went to marine garden bay evening light show, entery was free, an absolutely fantastic unmissable event.",,
,,Fun and You Can Beat the Heat,5,,"Gardens by The Bay is a Singapore must see. Easy to access by MRT go early and avoid the crowds. Both the Cloud Forest and Flower Gardens are enclosed in Bio-domes, the are manicured exernal gardens and the supertrees (2 of which are connected by a skyway making for impressive photos). If you want a stroll through lush gardens, experience a cloud forest, see numerous gardens from all over the world, or get up high for some fantastic views, this is the place. Plenty of restrooms and food stops strategically placed so as to not upset the beauty. We spent several hours here. You can visit all day an into the evening (the supertrees are lighted at night). They have an excellent website to use for planning.",,
,,One of my favourite place on earth,5,,Been a Friends of the Garden for the 3rd year. Always looking forward to their special theme display which never fail to disappoint. It鈥檚 also a pleasure to visit the cloud forest enjoying the mist. Simply beautiful,,
,,Loved it,5,,"My wife and I arrived by MRT and went immediately to the Super Trees which were just fantastic. Take the Skywalk if you are OK with heights. We followed this by a walk round the Cloud Gardens and the Flower dome. Both excellent, but the Xmas displays and some of the sculptures guilted an otherwise perfect Lilly. We then went for some Chicken Satay at Satay on the Bay and then finished off by watching the light display back at the Super trees. An excellent but tiring day.",,
,,Up close with nature,5,,"Visited the flower dome and gardens by the bay during the special showcase period of the sunflower season in Sep-Oct 2018. The flower dome offers different exhibits whole year round and it's always interesting to see different types of themes during different seasons. Gardens by the bay is an extensive piece of beauty in the city area with marvellous views of MBS, marina barrage, singapore flyer etc at different parts of the gardens. It's always enjoyable to have a stroll in the gardens, especially during evening times when the weather is less warm.",,
,,Cut the kitsch,3,,"This is a botanical garden of the 21st century, so most of the emphasis is on the fun, Disvey fun that is. We were astonished about the gaudy kitsch of the garden dome. All that Mickey Mouse nonsense belongs to Orchard Road, but not to a serious botanical garden.
Of course the structures are a magnificnent part of architecture, The cloudy rainforest was ineteresting, but the compositions and colours of flowers were really over the top.
We have no idea how the shuttle train works. Best you can do is walking from the MRT Bay.
No, we will not come again",,
,,"Lovely walk, rain or sun",5,,"It was a lovely walk in the gardens, taking you to all the oriental countries, with lots of greenness and water and sculptures and so on!
Lovely for families and couples!
You can enter the conservatories and take the walk on the treetops, where there are wonderful views to the Marina Bay Sands hotel and the whole city.
Worth visiting on day-time or on the evening during the light and music shows ( at 20.45 and 21.45).
The best views will be from the garden, not from the restaurant!",,
,,Unique,5,,By far the biggest collection of such exotic species of plants and flowers spanning the entire globe. A real treat for nature lovers. Also an interesting feature is the artificial waterfall.,,
,,A fantastic and wonderful experience,5,,The gardens by the bay are well worth a visit. Beautiful displays in the cloud and flower domes. It was disappointing that on the day we visited the gardens the skywalk around the giant trees was closed for maintenance but it was such a great day that we will be happy to go back there again when we get the chance.,,
,,Amazing place,4,,Cloud kingdom is a 35-40 feet tall artificial mountain with waterfalls and all kinds of plants and trees within a glass dome.,,
,,Stunning,4,,"My wife and I visited Gardens By The Bay on a recommendation. It is beautiful with magnificent scenery and right next to the awe inspiring Marina Bay Sands Hotel. The artificial trees have a dazzling light show at 7.45pm. A fabulous hanging walkway gives you fantastic views of the park and beyond. Walk through the gardens and you will get to Satay By The Bay which is a fairly authentic hawkers dining area offering all sorts of south East Asian food and at very affordable prices. A pleasant change given how expensive other tourist eateries can be in the city. The smells and noise from the place all add to the vibrant atmosphere. The Singaporean staff are all very friendly, pleasant and efficient and all speak perfect English. One for the bucket list.",,
,,"do not miss, unique",5,,"this really is an astonishing place and well worth the trip - do not miss. The site itself can be visited for free as entrance is only payable for the two huge glasshouses, nevertheless there is a tremendous variety of different attraction in the park. well worth spending a few hours walking arounds.",,
,,A Nice Walk,4,,Gardens by the Bay is a lovely place to get away from the shopping malls and hotels of Singapore. My wife and I took a kite and had fun flying it on top of a grassy knoll. It is a little sterile becuase it's man made but still a nice place to spend an hour or two.,,
,,Night time was even better than the day!,5,,We visited both day and night....you can spend hours there....but I think the night time visit was even more spectacular with all the Christmas lights already in place....just beautiful.,,
,,Gardens by the Bay undergoes periodic transformation,5,,"The Gardens by the Bay never fail to surprise visitors with the plethora of events that crowd it's calendar yearly; to the extent that surpasses even the changing of the seasons. From long past event like the Tulipmania to the more recent annual Mid-Autumn Festival & Lantern Display, the Singapore Garden Festival, the Begonia Brilliance Floral Display, the Children's Festival & Cartoon Network & the now ongoing Poinsettia Wishes- there's a reason for people of every age to visit & be enthralled by the natural floral beauty assembled by the creative imagination of the the Garden's horticultural staff at the Flower Dome. Little wonder that this is the most visited attraction in Singapore by both the international tourists & the local population alike, richly deserving of the title ""the Crown Jewel of Singapore""",,
,,Beautiful,5,,What a place its spectacular so well appointed and cared for. Work going on all year round we chose an audio ride that went for 20 mins. Very informative and saved your legs. So glad we went.,,
,,Fantastic!,5,,We started and finished our walk from the Marina Bay Sands. From start to finish this place was eye candy! Our mouths stayed gaping the entire time. The landscaping is gorgeous. The Supertree Grove is truly unique and a nice place for a view. The domes (Cloud Forrest and Flower Dome) were each dazzling and a great escape from the heat. Recommend spending half a day here. Definitely a must see on any trip to Singapore.,,
,,Eco Therapy and Respite from City Life,5,,Visit the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. Or just chill out under the stars at night. Good for Pokemon Trainers - lots of Gyms and Poke Stops. Watch for sunrise at the water gate. Great morning exercise. LUNCH at Satay by the Bay. Hide from the noon sun in the Flower Dome or Cloud Forest..,,
,,Walk and relax,5,,Finally with trees and plants grew it is good place to have walk. Try flying kites in Marina Barrage and if you are with kids - playgorund wet (take sublock) and in the trees. Avoid Sundays as it is getting very crowded.,,
,,Best of Singapore,5,,"3 hours worth spent. Beautiful is an understatement. Must visit place..you get bit tired of walking but worth it. Took this package through klook which had a good deal. Went around 9.00 am through MRT.. Well connected by bus and MRT. Spent time till 12.00.
Good options for food. Previous night we covered tree groove light show..it was okay and proceeded to satay by bay nice place to have Singapore food.",,
,,Go see what the hype is about,5,,A bit pricy but you have come all this way not to check it out. Definitely enjoyed! Family friendly.,,
,,Unbelievable Indoor Gardens,5,,"Wow! Singapore is a country of superlatives, but these gardens are truely exceptional. The displays change all the time. When were were there one of the buildings was having a rose show. The other, contains an actual mountain and rain forest. This is not to be missed! Best of all it's indoors and climate controlled, an important consideration in a country where it's 80 degrees the sun comes up and 90 when it goes down!",,
,,Amazing!,5,,"We enjoyed the night time show, the Skywalk. The Flower and Cloud Domes were simply stunning. An absolut must for any visitor",,
,,"Stunning, simply stunning!",5,,"We went along around 6.30pm and nabbed a great spot to watch the sound and light show. Many people just sat down in the middle of the walkway and then lay down to get a great view of the lights - hey no one was going anywhere anyway! Everyone was chatting and then as the music began a collective silence fell... the coloured lights created a magical fairyland and the timed music enhanced the atmosphere, enough to bring some to tears. Afterwards we had a quick dinner in the many restaurants nearby - bit average - we should have headed back into the city for some more authentic satays. Overall a magical experience.",,
,,Absolutely amazing!,5,,"Me and my partner visited the Gardens by the Bay in July 2018. it was absolutely stunning, and by far both our favourite part of Singapore. We spent a whole day there and didn't get bored. Neither of us know much about plants or flowers but that doesn't matter, the scenery and the amount of things to look at is amazing. We had to pay extra to go up on the skywalk but it was so worth it, you get a great views of not only the gardens but the Singapore skyline. If we ever visit Singapore again, we would definitely go back!",,
,,Fantastic place to visit in Singapore,5,,"Even though it was quite hot and humid, the two climate controlled areas provide a welcome break and are an amazing gathering of plants from the temperate zone around the world. The SuperTrees are a super high tech way to house solar panels at the top. The largest tree is in fact a restaurant. The night light show is fantastic.",,
,,Superb,5,,The gardens are beautiful and the cloud forest and flower dome are definitely worth a visit. Arrive later in the afternoon so that you can see the transformation from day to night as the whole place is stunning in the dark,,
,,Beautiful gardens here,5,,We really enjoyed our visit here. At first we think we don't want to enter to the exhibitions and just strolling around the area. But we end up buying tickets. And I don't regret. I was a great experience and also we learned something. All good very relaxing.,,
,,We're leaving the tropics ..,5,,"Amazing sights, just like in a garden with very temperate feel to it .. especially when you put your bare feet on the floors .. it's like leaving behind the tropical zone .. or driving up the hillsides (in the tropics)",,
,,A green man made oasis in a busy city!,5,,"My wife and I recently visited Gardens by the Bay.
We were both impressed and amazed by some of the exhibits an the amount of design and thought has gone into their presentation.
Both the flower dome and cloud forest are a must visit, with the man made waterfall and flora / flowers in the cloud forest a stand out!
If you have the opportunity, wait around to after dark to witness a great light show across the Supertrees!

The Good: So clean and well maintained!
The Better: Heaps of friendly staff to point you in the right direction!
The Best: The Cloud Forest, amazing indoor garden, waterfall, mountain walkway!",,
,,"Good place to visit, especially for the evening light show",5,,"Good palce to visit as tourist, with family or just for an evening walk. The light show starts around 19:45 (be there in time since distance is lounger than you expect before you have ben here). The have transfer service for those in need. The light show including music is superfun for kids!",,
,,One word : superb,5,,Gardens by d bay is place worth to visit...the two domes...as soon as u enter those you get freezed and the greenery waterfalls mesmerise you..,,
,,Good,3,,"It was raining when we went to visit GBTB. We bought our tickets online to skip the Q but unfortunately we still need to Q to buy tickets for the shuttle. It will be much appreciated if they could have a separate counter for shuttle alone when it's raining coz they should expect a crowd during bad weather. There are some unfriendly staff. But overall, the place itself is very nice.",,
,,Perfect place to Explore,5,,"Beautiful walk...best to explore when it鈥檚 not too hot. A must do in Singapore. Suitable for loners, couples, families and kids.",,
,,Hot but impressive,5,,Was already hot by the time we arrived via Metro. Impressive display of fantastic flowers etc and static displays.,,
,,Exceptional experience!,5,,The Cloud Dom will blow your mind and the Flower Dome is very impressive. The aerial walkway through the trees is well worth the extra S$8.,,
,,Great Experience,5,,Was not sure what to expect but we both really enjoyed our visit. We spent three hours in the garden and could easily have spent more time. Would certainly recommend a visit. It is not expensive and would be fun trip for all the family.,,
,,Sunny,5,,"Good view, Good food ,Good Service. Will be back again with my family.one nice place to go in Singapore.",,
,,Clouds and Flowers to Impress the most Severe Critic... Incredible,5,,"We had seen the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest on a gardening television program and decided to visit during our Singapore stopover.
How extraordinarily remarkable! We have been gardeners for decades and live on the edge of a subtropical rainforest.
We have not seen any thing like it anywhere.

For those with an understanding of gardens and natural ecosystems we were dumbfounded by this outstanding achievement. Congratulations Gardens By the Bay",,
,,Goog but better during the day,4,,Gardens by the bay are fantastic but it is better to see them during day time as the light during night time is poor.,,
,,Worth come again and again,5,,"Been to this place few times, every time got new things added, you will never tire of visiting it again",,
,,gardens by the Bay marvellous to see,5,,Awesome place to visit not to be missed. The light show in the evening is excellent. One of the best place to visit in Singapore.,,
,,Tsum tsum Christmas theme at flower doom,4,,"Nice deco, but I was hoping to see nice orchids. Not available, likely to have been replaced by Tsum Tsum",,
,,Awesome place,5,,Awesome place. Definitely recommend the Cloud forest. The flower dome is ok but best scene first as the cloud forest is superior. We didn鈥檛 get to the super tree walk as we thought it would be better in the evening & well as it does in Singapore it poured so we missed out.,,
,,Fin day at the Gardens!,5,,"Our second time to visit the Flower Dome, and it didn鈥檛 disappoint. We were there with our 11mo old and he really enjoyed all the colors and especially the Christmas display.",,
,,Worth the money,5,,Amazing! A must go when you鈥檙e in Singapore! Make sure to get the package ticket. Wait for 7:45 pm for the laser and light show at the OCBC. Also Cloud Forest releases mist at certain times of the day so don鈥檛 miss it 馃挴,,
,,Man made wonder,5,,"A man made wonder, certainly not to miss when you are in Singapore. Enjoyed the 7:45pm light and sound show, spectacular, scintillating experience.",,
,,Garden Rhapsody,5,,"We took our toddler to the nighttime light/music show at the main tree grove. 鈥楪arden Rhapsody鈥?on that night was a mixture of popular songs from the 70s & 80s.

Thousands of people gathered to sit around the trees (some were standing on the walkways between the trees). Locals and tourists alike came to enjoy together.

I鈥檝e never had an experience quite like this one. Do not miss it if you come to Singapore.

-Free!
-Only 15 minutes long
-fun for all ages
-easy to find a good seat because the show is the entire grove

*If you are leaving by taxi, it is best to walk through the park towards the Marina Bay Sands Hotel to catch your cab, otherwise the taxi queue at Gardens by the Bay entrance could take up to an hour (for only a 15 minute show)*",,
,,Fabulous SuperTree Grove,5,,"We only went to see the Supertrees, and they are amazing. Did not pay to go up to the observation platform or into either of the domes.
Only issue we had was all the construction on the gardens. As we were on foot, it meant a LOT more walking. Entrance off Marina Dr is not open, so we had to walk the long way round to find a place to enter",,
,,Unhappy at the Bay,2,,"There has to be a total revamp Programme on both the forest n flower dome , the flowers are really pale in comparison to our Singapore Botanic and the Forest dome has that totally unmaintained condition with mossess and algae all over the walls . Both domes seems so worn out and dead.. there is no feeling of vibrancy the moment u enter the premises. I don't feel wow by the sight :(",,
,,Great place to expend a few hours,5,,"Tidy and nice climatized domes with a glimpse of plants from various biomes including some Socotra flora. Plenty of orchids, interactive areas and well explained strategies for vegetation.",,
,,Great light show and music,4,,"It gets quite packed but you dont want to miss the show. Not enough time to explore everything, Free",,
,,Stunning Gardens by the Bay,5,,"This place is amazing, and on a hot day in Singapore (which most are) is a welcome sight and climate change. Everyone visiting Singapore must visit this unique beautiful location.",,

,,Beautiful gardens,5,,"Fabulous ""Supertrees"" which are spectacular especially at night with light displays. Lovely gardens, an aquarium and sculptures.",,
,,Truly one of the most beautiful and ecological places to visit,5,,"I have been wanted to visit 'Gardens by the Bay' for a very long time and now that I have been there... I cannot express enough how beautiful this place truly is. From the moment you walk towards it, it stands out and provides a sight you have never seen before. Whilst being self-sustaining with a great eco-system for those who love nature and technology, it also provides a great place for fantastic views of the city. You cannot help but admire the man made trees and care taken to the attraction. A great place of learning, exploring and seeing a beautiful site. Highly recommended to see the lights show and display which is again all powered by renewable energy. Absolutely remarkable and a must see in Singapore... BTW IT LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE IT DOES ON GOOGLE!!",,
,,Superb,5,,"Like the Eden project on steroids! Expected it to be hot in there but is was lovely & cool, how they get the flowers to bloom at the same time, I have no idea! We spent half a day in there & enjoyed it.",,
,,Excellent,5,,"Excellent total value for the buck. Really happy visited the place, will recommend to one and all. Totally worth the time",,
,,Nice visit,4,,I have brought my mom and family to visit Garden by the Bay cause she loved flowers very much. She felt very happy as there's a lot of different types of flower she never has seen before she visited this flower dome. Will recommended to friends.,,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,Awesome experience with a kaleidoscope of colours intermingling as reflections on the lakes and glowing on the giant mushroom structures and on the orchids... a sight to feast your eyes on and to savour at least oonce in a lifetime....!,,
,,Interesting spots in Singapore,5,,Those are the places you should not miss! The whole of Singapore city is impressively clean and pleasant!,,
,,must see in Singapore,5,,The gardens is a sight and must be on your city tour in Singapore. Come early or in the evening - otherwise is so crowed you will not enjoy. Bring at least 2 hours - because it is a big play ground here. All ammenities like restaurants and cafes are here. You will enjoy it a lot.,,
,,Do not miss it,5,,"A must when in Singapore - truly a one of a kind experience for all ages, and the sustainability and communication around global climate change is well done.",,
,,"Just a light, nothing special",3,,"So so If u like some light show or you stay near this place, just go If u want something unique, this place is soso",,
,,Beautiful area,4,,"Free to walk around the park. Free wifi at super trees. Only pay to enter glass houses and to climb super trees.

Sg$3 for unlimited rides on the shuttle from the metro exit to glass houses entrance. Glass domes close at 9pm. Hand stamp to renter domes for free. Good amount of toilets around the area.

Light and music show at 7.45pm at the super trees.",,
,,A beautiful Garden with a beautiful variety of flowers!,3,,"This is one experience which one who is looking for beautiful nature in it's many forms, must visit. It is a big garden and nothing else.. Was not very enamored.",,

,,Spectacular,5,,"Don鈥檛 miss this spectacular display! Worth a trip to Singapore just to see it. Spent 5 hours wandering around, still didn鈥檛 see it all.",,
,,Night walk,5,,I would recommend a visit in the evening once the lights go on. Be aware that you can get in for free. You don't have to go on a paying tour.,,
,,"Must try for both young and old, great for selfie lovers",5,,"Both paid dorms are worthy to visit, plenty of places to take photos or selfies. Quite number of good eateries.",,
,,A lovely experience,4,,We enjoyed both garden structures. One was done up from characters from The Wizard of Oz. Very well put together.,,
,,In my top 3 things to do in Singers!,5,,If you don't visit the Gardens by the Bay you're missing out! Can't do it justice talking about it but suffice it to say the trees are awesome and at 1945-2000 each night they play a sound and light show well worth watching from right in amongst the trees.,,
,,Fantastic!,5,,"We were brought here by Monster Day walking tours. Our guide took us to different areas of the park and pointed out the best places to stand for the evening light show, which was great. The foliage was great, orchids beautiful and the night light show was the highlight of the evening. Anyone visiting Singapore must see it!",,
,,What an experience!,5,,Spent a fabulous day exploring this wonderful park. The cloud forest dome and flower dome are something very special. The night light show at the tall trees was a must see.,,
,,worth a visit,5,,"Great place, educational and informative. Well designed place with a great collection of trees and other flora. Highly recommended",,
,,Best of Singapore & Free A/C!,5,,"As an SG residents who live nearby GBB, we visit here monthly. Always something new and interesting to see. Please bring a 35mm camera because there's so many wonderful plants, flowers, people, and scenery to capture. If a local, we suggest buying an annual pass and concessionaire discount if qualified. Best deal in town.",,
,,Singapore Gardens,5,,"Don't sell yourself short on this one, needs a full day. Magnificient and only half completed. I will have to go back when they finish it. Compares favourably with Butchart Garden in Canada.",,
,,A feast for the eyes,5,,"The Gardens by the Bay are breathtaking, even in the rain. The structures, the greenery, the wildlife is just breathtaking. A real must to see if one visit's Singapore.",,
,,Superb experience,5,,"Great tropical gardens plus two huge temperate domes filled with superb set piece gardens enhanced by life size animal wood sculptures. As night falls, light changes and you can see Marina Bay Sands through glazed domes. Then back into open gardens to see sound and light show. We had 70's disco. Great fun and spectacular lighting. A must see on any short pass through Singapore",,
,,Superb,5,,The gardens are superb great during the day but amazing to see the light show in the evening it was truly magnificent and very well done can鈥檛 fault it and would highly recommend people to take the time to visit,,
,,A quiet place in a busy city,3,,"If you鈥檝e been to Singapore you know that it鈥檚 a bustling metropolis. Combine that with the extraordinary heat and humidity of being so close to the equator and you can quickly need an escape. Gardens by the Bay was that retreat for me.

The public park was built as a gift to the population of Singapore as part of the deal to build the Marina Bay Sands and associated casino. While it has the normal trappings of a public park such as ponds, statues and lushl tropical gardens... prepare for a typically Singaporean twist.

At the centre of the gardens the 鈥渟uper trees鈥?are vast constructions with ecology at their centre. They conceal the equipment that helps to serve the local buildings with cool air. They have solar panels for green power generation. They are planted out with diverse species of plants throughout their vast structure. So successful are these green projects, that species of birds that had long since fled Singapore have now returned to nest in their eco-cyber boughs.

There is a bar at the top of one of the trees that provides stunning views across the park. You can get a similar view by taking the walk along the bridge that spans between the super trees. Be aware that these will shut during inclement weather. Due to the large amount of lightening you get in Singapore, this can be annoyingly frequent. Also, you don鈥檛 get much for free in Singapore, so while exploring at ground level is free, be prepared to pay for everything else. It鈥檚 for this reason that I have to drop the score.

By far my best experience at the Gardens by the Bay was the nightly musical and light spectacular. The whole garden, principally lit by the magnificent super trees pulse in a choreographed mix of colourful lights that match the accompanying music. Make sure that you look it up, I was surprised by the number of people, even locals, who didn鈥檛 know about this (absolutely free) event.",,
,,Many things to do around,5,,"Its near marina bay sands, marina barrage, helix bridge, fullerton hotel. Many attractions nearby to visit!",,
,,Iconic Structures of Singapore,5,,Not to be missed tourist destination. World class architecture /domes. Persons of all ages will like it..,,
,,Dont Miss the evening musical show,4,,"Loved the concept. Just lie on the grass and look up at the show. Its very very nice

Try and go for the last show

The skywalk is ok, if you cant do that I dont think you will miss anything but do enjoy the musical show in the gardens

There is Macdonald as well and the train station is also attached",,
,,Magical tour,5,,Wandering with kids in these magical gardens is a real pleasure. Walking above the trees was amazing,,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,The gardens were lovely to walk around but the highlight for us was the Cloud dome. It was fantastic with the waterfall and all the plants growing at such a height. A real must.,,
,,Gardens by the Bay and Marina Sands Skypark tour,3,,"Another tour booked thru Viator. Offers hotel pickup and transportation to Gardens by the Bay, Super Tree light show and sound show, admission to the Observation Deck at Marina Sands, river cruise and transport back to hotel. Long que for the lift back down so be patient.",,
,,Good place to Relax.,5,,"If you have a few hours come to the Gardens as it is close to MBS. It is best to walk from MBS to the Gardens as you go by the walkway and go passed the Chinese Gardens and the Indian Gardens.
Where ever you walk in the Gardens can see the MBS hotel. If you want to walk among the Supertrees you need to pay but it is worthwhile as you get to see all of Marina Bay.",,
,,Well worth the visit,5,,"For those like me that are not keen gardeners the Gardens by the bay is without doubt, well worth a visit.
Visiting the 3 parks took 4hrs at a slow pace. The Cloud Forest is spectacular with the amazing waterfall as you enter the dome.
There are elevators so no need to worry about climbing stairs.
The wonderful array of world flowers on display in the flower dome is educational and colourful.
Don't miss this attraction.",,
,,Awesome,5,,Love how child-friendly is the place! Went with my young kids and they have thoroughly enjoyed it. Awesome,,
,,Always a great experience,5,,Beautiful place for a walk during the day and even more so at night. It just never disappoints. By pure chance we happened to be there at night where there was a light and music show which was very entertaining and a lot of fun to experience!,,
,,Beautiful night from above,4,,"1st time taking the Spore Flyer and with 馃應, good experience and didn't realise Marina Bay night view is so beautiful....",,
,,Best place for walks!,5,,"Best place in SG for a gd stroll be it in the day or at night (Would prepare the evenings as its cooler) Be sure to check out the Supergrove trees and just sit and chill on the grass patch and watch the Gardens skyline, amidst glowing trees. Its also walkable distance to Marina Bay Sands (directly linked to the MRT station)",,
,,Beautiful location and nature getaway,5,,"With a half-day to myself on a business trip, this was a great way to get out, stretch my legs and relax in a very beautiful environment. As a visitor to the country, it was also great to be able to use the MRT system to get right from my hotel to the Garden; very easy. They did a great job arranging the park so that you get different views and scenes with every turn of the path. The massive man-made trees also provide an interesting perspective. Also, they have great food if you need to grab lunch or dinner!",,
,,Amazing,5,,"Such an amazing magical place. The super grove was awesome. We happened to be there at 7:30pm when the light show started, which happens every night to a different theme. I would definetely recommend seeing that.",,
,,Mixed,3,,Mixed feelings. On one hand great achivement to build a garden on land reclaimed from the sea with great effort and cost. On the other full of plastic cartoon personalities and quirky music from hidden speakers ( jingle bells on 4th of November?) and tons of people. Nice views though.,,
,,Excellent tourist attraction,5,,"This is one of the best tourist attraction especially for nature lovers. Two huge domes, go first to the flower dome for its beauty is to be experienced in natural sunlight and then go to the second dome for the experience is great in fading light at sunset. Stay for the musical and light show on the artificial trees. It is sheer bliss and soothing.",,
,,Great place to relax,5,,Great place to relax and ease off your mind. Beautiful gardens and when walking on the Big Grovetree you will experience the beautiful view of the Bay Area.,,
,,Beautiful Man-Made spot,5,,"When you visit a country you really appreciate the effort they go to for tourists to get to the attractions. So easy to get to by MRT. We arrived after 5 pm at the MRT station so we paid for a shuttle to the Gardens. It was fun. Lovely spot. We visited the Cloud Forrest Dome and then the Flower Dome. We managed to make it to the Supertree Grove for the light show at 7:45pm We paid to go up the OCBC Tree walkway. We managed to go up when the light show was still on. So amazing!! There were guards up there to keep us safe. Well done Gardens, you know how to put on a show. We really enjoyed the Cloud Forrest Dome. There wasn't any lines at the ticket kiosk after 5pm. There are enough places to eat. We ordered takeaway at Bakerzin. Expensive but worth it. Packaged beautifully. The burgers and fries were the best!",,
,,"Very different experience, at an expense though",5,,Visited Flower dome n cloud forest. The scale at which plants n flowers are grown is just amazing. 2 hours max is what should be allowed by an average tourist. Costs SGD 28 per person which could be on higher side. Yet its worth doing at least once. The best part was outside these two domes - Super trees. We went half hour early to capture prime seats for the sound n light show. The 10-15 min show was an activation to the senses. Great time n great experience,,
,,Love this place,4,,"I love visiting this place. I took a few friends here that hadn't been. It's great at night, good to combine with the light show at marina bay. When you visit the trees, lay down and look up :).",,
,,Light Show Spectacular,5,,"We loved our visit to the gardens however we were only there for the nightly light show at Supertree Grove.... which was spectacular. We were there in October 2018 so the lights were set to musical show music and was wonderful. We didn't have enough time to visit during the day or the inside areas / parks area which was disappointing as I really wanted to see the sculptures and take the kids to the water park. It was closed the day we could go, so we just did dinner and the light show. Highly recommended for families! Our kids thought it was great",,
,,Relaxation in the city,5,,This beautifull part of Singapore is an absolute treat for those who are looking for some peace and quiet. Well structured and beatifully maintained park where you can spend a few hours. Every great has a great park. This is the one for Singapore.,,
,,AVATAR AT NIGHT,4,,Its best to go sight seeing here at night time to appreciate the light show and fireworks. Garden walk can be too pricey if you are on a budget.,,
,,Waterpark with kids - bring swimming costume!,5,,"The outside garden is free, including the children鈥檚 waterpark. The kids loved the water sprinklers but be sure to pack swimming costumes and towels!",,
,,Beautiful flower gardens,5,,The cloud garden and the flower garden were both spectacular. Unfortunately the was raining so could use the self drive cars or go up to the skywalk. The light show from our hotel was also excellent.,,
,,A nice place to unwind,5,,"Spectacular setting and a great place to sit and relax after the hubbub of the city. East to get to, but what place isn鈥檛 in Singapore? Lots of places to sit, eat, drink and reflect. A must see day and night.",,
,,Great night show,4,,Walked here along the river from Clarke Quay. Arrived as it was getting dark just in time for the light show in the neon gardens section. Light show was set to music and was very good. Would recommend for young kids because it does not go on for too long,,
,,Stop over Barcelona to Auckland,5,,An absolute must visit for all if in Singapore. Spectacular and an easy walk but suggest going on cooler months.,,
,,Bay Gardens,5,,This is a must see for any visitor to Singapore. I have no real interest in floral displays but this takes anything I have seen previously to a whole new level,,
,,beuatiful by day and night,5,,Beautiful gardens and domes. Dont miss Satay by the bay for lunch and make sure you staty for the tree light show in the evening.,,
,,Travellers Bucket List experience,5,,"We loved the cloud garden, it was amazing, could have spent all day in there marvelling at the amazing structure and features.
Lots of tour groups so try to get ahead or lag behind so that you can take some good photos.
Flower garden is also good but we preferred the Cloud Garden.",,
,,Great Experience,5,,"Great place to spend a few hours and walk around, it鈥檚 a place that will definitely create some great visual memories! Well worth a visit whilst you鈥檙e in Singapore!",,
,,Beautiful place,4,,"Beautiful place to be , we visited with the family and it鈥檚 one of the best tourist destination. Do visit",,
,,Garden by the Bay,5,,A fantastic feat of engineering alone! The flora in the Cloud dome is exceptional and the flower dome varieties of plants outstanding. The light show was fun too.,,
,,"Fabulous, Marvellous, Must See.",5,,"This place is spectacular! So much to see and not too expensive.
Plan to spend the whole day here and do it at a steady pace. The place is very large and the weather can be quite hot so do not rush.
Great food an beverage places available at good prices for any budget.
Toilets and parent rooms clean and comfortable.
Can get there by train or taxi quite easily.
If you have small children, pack a towel and change of clothes for the free water play area.
Taking a stroller around is very easy.
The worlds cities could take a great deal of inspiration for having such an amazing public space available.
So much to talk about but so little time to write.
Really go and see this place it is beautiful. Pay extra and go into the conservatory鈥檚 they are simply amazing.",,
,,A must thing to do list,5,,I fell in love with this place. Visited twice within 2 years. The Falls resembles tranquility. The Cloud Walk is awesome. Tree Top Walk also a must do unless you are afraid of height.,,
,,Eden project,5,,"Very new a type of Eden project. Inside may be covered but the humidity is intense. We sweated buckets and we were told to bring a change of clothing so had spare t shirts.
The flowers ,plants and trees are beautiful. The insects are seen all around and I wasn't going to touch most of them.
The cafe is really welcome . A sit and pot of tea, grand.
There are play areas, education points and resting areas. Again lots to photograph.",,
,,Holly Cow!!!,5,,"Stunning, beautiful, unique and walk around the world in hours.....the collection is elegant and true to each country. Some of the sculptures are totally memorable - i can still see the giant eagle carved from a tree root in my mind - :)",,
,,It needs more SIGNS,4,,It is well kept and very entertaining. The staff and system is very efficient but it is very difficult to go around. The place needs more visible signs.,,
,,Beautiful and educational!,4,,"Was a lovely way to spend a morning in the air conditioned domes! Cloud forest was incredible. I would 100% go again if I were in Singapore again.
I went solo as a young woman but would be excellent for young kids to experience and definitely fun for the whole family.",,
,,A highlight of our trip to Singapore,5,,This is one of the most extraordinary botanical gardens I've ever visited. We visited both the flower garden and the cloud garden - they are really gorgeous! A lovely way to spend the afternoon in Singapore.,,
,,Most 鈥渃ooling 鈥?garden in Singapore,4,,GBTB is truly one of the most beautiful 鈥渕an-made鈥?Garden in Singapore! It always have beautiful themes from time to time and every experience is unique even though we visited almost once or twice a year!,,
,,Holiday,5,,"This is something out of this world, no matter how many photos you see of it there is still no words for how amazing it is. The fact that they keep changing it with the flowers is amazing as well so if you go back at a different time of year you are going to see something different as well... We loved it and highly recomend it",,
,,Unbelievable,5,,Everything we saw at the Gardens was simply stunning and blew our minds. When you visit the first dome you are simply amazed and it goes on for the second dome. Don鈥檛 forget the Tree Top Walkway. Each dome is air conditioned. The domes have many peculiar and special species of plants that you will not find as beautifully arranged anywhere else.You should consider a full day to visit the domes and the outside gardens. You will not be disappointed here.,,
,,a MUST staying in Singapore,5,,Wonderful arrangement of various flowers and trees in two separate greenhouses (airconditioned) at reasonable price,,
,,Supertrees are Amazing!,4,,"The Gardens by the Bay are easily accessible by the subway from most anywhere in Singapore. It鈥檚 the Bayfront stop on the yellow MRT line. There is an elevated walkway from the Sands hotel that takes you right to the Supertrees. (See photo) The Supertrees are 25-50 meters tall, and one of the trees is as high as a 16 story building. The tops of some of the trees contain photovoltaic cells, which collect energy from the sun. The Supertrees are actually vertical gardens, with climbing plants from all over the world growing up the sides. There are diagrams and information on how the trees collect, store and distribute energy and some act as air exhausts. (See photo) Visiting the gardens and the Supertrees from the ground is free.

There is also an ariel walkway 22 meters off the ground (OCBC Skyway) which winds around between several of the trees. (See photos) The cost to access the Skyway is 8 Singapore dollars per adult. We went during the day, and it was not crowded. But there was a queue line set up, so I imagine it gets very crowded at night when the Supertrees are all lit up.

If you are going to walk around the gardens, be aware that it is hot! Be sure to wear a hat or take an umbrella and plenty of water. We faded from the heat before we got to the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. You can take a cab directly to the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest to avoid walking as much outside.",,
,,high up,4,,"Good couple of hours out , everything was spotless , flowers , plants and trees were lovely . The sky walk between artificial trees was a bit disappointing , the way it was just a walk , we were expecting somewhere to sit , enjoy the views , and some refreshments , but there was a maximum amount of people allowed , and a time limit on the walk . Some people were intimidated by the height and were holding on , they struggled to walk from lift to lift . With the humidity and heavy showers its best to get transport to gardens , colourful by night when lit up .",,
,,"The outside area, including evening light show is free",5,,"We covered both indoor areas and outdoor park including the overhead walkway in one day, its well worth a visit. On the second day we returned to catch the sunset and the musical light show at 7.45pm.",,
,,Singapore's Gardens by the Bay - one of my favourites,5,,This is where Singapore brought the flora of the mountain and temperate climate to the city area of the hot and humid Singapore. It is one of the favourite places that I regularly visit as different types of flora would be on display once every few months. Visitors to the climate-controlled domes would need to pay an entry fee. The outdoor gardens are free to visit where visitors would find it comfortable to stroll or jog in the morning and evening to avoid the scorching afternoon sun.,,
,,Fascinating tropical green houses on the bay,4,,"One can visit the public outside area of the Gardens by the Bay free of charge but if you want to see the spectacular vertical green houses under the glasss domes you will have to pay (S$28 for adults and S$12 children). The green houses are very tall and contain many levels of beautiful tropical and temperate plants (they claim ther are are 1 million differnt plants) and art sculptures that can be reached by walk-ways, escalators and elevators. There are even indoot water-falls. The whole place is air-conditioned so it offers a reprieve from the humid climate outside. Some of the sculptures are a bit kitschy and clearly aimed at children but nevertheless the place is quite fascinating and unlike I had ever seen before. Don鈥榯 visit if you are afraid of heights as some of the walk-ways and vantage points are very high up. Recommended!",,
,,Great experience,4,,"I've visited Singapore on numerous occasions but never found the time to visit the Gardens by the Bay.

Worth going especially in the evening to catch the sunset and the musical show at 7.45pm.

Grab some food and find a place to picnic while waiting for the lights/musical show.

Great experience and worth going at least once.",,
,,"very relaxing, very beautiful",4,,"This is a very comfortable place to stroll and spend the day. The displays are updated on a regular basis and never fail to surprise with the quality and quantity of beautiful flowers.
it is a place for both young and old. many nice photo spots to collect beautiful memories.",,
,,Must see after the sunset,5,,Gardens inside the two large domes are interesting and very well made. Especially the second dome with the waterfall is special place. If you aren't too keen on the plants the outdoor areas are well worth the visit. Especially after the sunset when all the lights can be seen. There's lots of places to just sit and relax or you can walk around. Everything outside the domes is free to access except the skywalk between the trees.,,
,,Must see for garden lovers,5,,"We visited when in Singapore - it is interesting to see all those different species together, even though a bit frustrating to see a lot of people touch (and break) some flowers, despite no touch signs. It is amazing to see all the work behind to recreate such a place.",,
,,Not bad,4,,"I think it's not bad tho
But we walk through a long long way to went there and tbh it's different from my expectations. Because before I visited here, I saw pictures and its so pretty but it turns out just like that
But maybe it's the weather condition too
Idk",,
,,Singapore highlight,5,,Flowers and plants from around the world in one place! I would plan 2-3 hours to visit Flower Dome and Cloud Forest.,,
,,Absolutely must see when in Singapore!,5,,"These gardens are amazing. Inexpensive day out and the most awesome garden sculptures, themes and plants in one huge place. Just breathtaking - clean, informative and overall magnificent place.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,"What an inspiring place, magnificent, for gardeners inspiring, even if you are not it is a fabulous place to visit. We were overwhelmed with the experience. This was one of the reasons for visiting Singapore and we were not disappointed. Highly recommend.",,
,,Time needed,4,,"A Singapore Icon a must see for all the family, time was a factor with us but got to see enough to say ""we will be back"" if your green at heart you will love this place but make plenty of time to enjoy.",,
,,Mesmerizing!,5,,"If you have time for only one thing in Singapore, this is it! Take the time to attend the amazing light displays at night. You will enjoy every minute of the music and synchronized lights. Absolutely stunning!",,
,,"Awesome place, truly worth the visit. Plan a head so it wont take much time.",5,,"The gardens were amazing. I highly recommend going there and spending the afternoon. I went way before sunset, and after a while of walking around and figuring out times, we caught a beautiful sunset with the Marina Bay Sands behind us and then the place really comes to life with lights and that perfect moment of sunset with night time lighting was amazing. From the Cloud Forest we went to the super tree grove and caught the night show. Totally worth it, great plan. The trees are free, but the other places have prices based on if you enter both or just one place.",,
,,World of wonders!,5,,"If you're on a short visit and haven't got long to spend in Singapore, then make Gardens by the Bay your main place of visit. It's a must see experience and you won't regret it. What's more, if you plan your visit well and you're still there in the evening, you can watch the amazing sound and light display at the gardens and then a little later at the harbour front! So worth it!",,
,,Beautiful place,3,,Nice place to visit. Great outing for families. Easy to get to. Prices to get into cordoned off gardens a bit over the top,,
,,Stunning!,5,,"We live in Victoria, and are proud of the Butchart Gardens. The Gardens by the Bay are truly magnificent. A MUST SEE when in Singapore",,
,,Birthday treat,5,,Some friends invited me for a special occasion outing. The garden in the bay was crowded but the sight of the plants and flowers display were well thought and creative. Long walk but well worth the visit.,,
,,Amazing!!,5,,"Incedible gardens with a fantastic light show. Most of the garden is free, and a charge or around $25 to visit the domes and sky walk. Highly reccommended. Fantastic facilities and super clean.",,
,,Too much Heaven!,5,,My wife & i really luv to visit these gardens as it's pretty & so colorful. Seems like we are in Heaven at least for a short while. Also looks like all the flowers all over the world are here.,,
,,A unique destination for nature lovers,5,,"Besides the main Flower dome, there is the Cloud Forest. Price to enter both domes is more economical so decide in advance if you intend to visit both. They are just a short distance from each other. My advice is to visit them in the day. Lighting especially in Flower dome is quite dim in my opinion and you might miss seeing the lovely blooms at their best.",,
,,A very well laid out attraction,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is a unique attraction that offers a variety of sights and sensations. The novel 'trees' are different, the two domes magnificently laid out enabling those with an interest in horticulture to experience strange and familiar plants from all over the planet; prices are reasonable too. Good food outlets catering for most tastes. However I think that the nightly lights show is the jewel in the gardens' crown being spectacular both through its sight and well chosen sounds: and perhaps best of all this part free!",,
,,Simply Amazing!,5,,"The gardens are wonderful and truly an amazing experience....We viewed during the day and at night for the light show which personally, should not be missed!",,
,,Beautiful Gardens,5,,"Beautiful gardens, very well maintained and designed. Love the flower and cloud domes. This place is huge and needs a hours to really take in all the beautiful flowers and plants.",,
,,Awesome!!,5,,Magnificent experience with sections designed to highlight plants from different countries. It's amazing where some plants come from! Give yourself plenty of time to enjoy the outlook as well as the many garden displays.,,
,,MUST SEE,5,,"A visit to Singapore would not be complete without strolling around the Gardens By The Bay. I visitied the park during the day and duirng the evening light show, and I was mesmerised by the beauty and the sinuous elegant shapes of the neon structures.",,
,,Gardens at Bay Singapore,5,,Modern architecture. Magnificently created. Must visit by the tourist to Singapore to have the actual feel of the garden. Visit during evening will he ideal,,
,,Fabulous night light/music show at the Supergrove Trees.,4,,"I'd seen these during the day but they are very nice at night. There are two shows in the evening, 19h45 and 20h45 where the trees light up to some theme music. We were there for the 19h45 show and it was Retro tunes (brought back many memories of my youth). Definitely well worth it and it's free! It last about 15 minutes.",,
,,Light show is great,5,,The light show at night is well worth the time. The Sky walk is also worthwhile doing while you are there.,,
,,Worth Going,5,,One of the Best destinations of Singapore to Visit if you have young kinds who loves garden Plants and anything related to Nature.Awesome place to go fully Air Condtioned and amazing experience.,,

The world鈥檚 only man-made garden with so many different types of flowers, exortic plants from all over the world being nicely decorated and placed in a cool enclosure with state-of-the-Art and natural air-conditioning system. A wonderful place to visit for all ages - young and old alike. A good venue for a family outing. Recommended to also overseas visitors.",,
,,Wonderful experience,5,,Loved every bit of it. Missed the OCBC skyway as it was closed due to rain. Loved the cloud forest. Beautiful at night,,
,,Wonderful place to visit to see the flora and some fauna,5,,"This is a must see place and well worth doing over sunset to see the lights come on.
Sadly a couple of the displays were shut due to maintenance and sidi weather. The skywalk can be closed in heavy rain and thunderstorms.
The cloud house was amazing and we could have stayed longer.

To do properly you need at least three hours.",,
,,"Wow, Wow, Wow!!",5,,"We saw gardens by day and night. It truly amazed us - the plants, sculptures, carvings, and we had such a great time at the night light show - dancing to the music. Memorable.",,
,,"Hi-Tech meets Rainforest, artificial but everyone loves it! A must see for tourists, a popular go to for locals.",4,,"We all dread the doomsday scenario of disappearing habitats, forests, plant life ... then human life...? As an ode to extinct & near-extinct species, the Gardens by the Bay has preserved quite a collection & encased them in controlled domes & open gardens to enjoy. Baobabs, flowers & succulents abound in world geography-arranged ensembles in the Flower Dome while a rainforest is replicated in the Cloud Dome complete w/ a waterfall & 2 elevated walkways. Both domes are enormous greenhouses environmentally sustained for water & energy.

But everyone is drawn to the Supertree Grove w/ huge solar generators shaped like trees, its trunk covered by vertical gardens. A skywalk 22 meters high is accessible for a fee to enjoy 360 degree views. By nightfall, the Grove generates its own lights & is an awesome sight to behold, seen for miles around! Especially scenic alongside the beautiful Marina Bay Sands right across the highway.

The grounds are free & accessible to those who can walk: access is via Marina Bay Sands elevators to the footbridge & into the grounds. The Supertrees can be walked too but a SGD3 shuttle can bring you to & from the trees & exterior of domes & back to the foot of the bridge that crosses the highway.",,
,,Versatile entertaining,5,,"It is a unique facility, worldwide. There is achoice of quiet gardens outside and under a dome. There is modern technology everywhere, but decently hidden. Beutiful plant acosystems are easily acceisible. My favorite is a caffee shop in the gardens. I have been there on every weekend.",,
,,Unique and a must see!!,5,,Go in the even to watch the light show! We went in December and it was Christmas themed with Christmas markets. Lovely evening,,
,,The Garden City's Grandest Showcase,4,,"Gardens by the Bay is one of Singapore's most interesting attractions and highly popular with locals and tourists alike. There is none other like it in the world! Singapore is known the world over as a Garden City because of its lush greenery, and GBTB is set right within the heart of the city!",,
,,Largest collection of temperate plants on this side of the world,4,,"There are 2 domes at the Gardens by the Bay that acts like a greenhouse. One dome consist of thousands of flowers from all voer the world while the other depicts an equatorial rainforest.

The Super Tree in the compound which is free access is beautiful too and a favourite with photographers. The Super Trees are lighted in a myriad of colours at night and there is a path that connects one tree to another.",,
,,Amazing,5,,"My husband is a keen gardener so a visit here was a must. Saw all sorts of plants I have never seen or heard of before. Totally incredible and very well done and worth every penny for the admission fee. I especially enjoyed the Lego Venus fly traps and other carnivorous plants and the ceiling to floor water fall.
We couldn鈥檛 spend all day here unfortunately due to time restraints but I think you need to spend the day here to make full use of the gardens. We didn鈥檛 get to see the gardens lit at night unfortunately",,
,,Innovative Garden,5,,"This large garden is very innovative. It's like you're in another planet, with all the plant species on display. Very clean and very organized.",,
,,Artificially Natural Garden,4,,"If we want a beautiful garden, there it is with natural trees, plants and beautifully 'decorated' to make it a masterpiece of a scenic place. It also has huge 'super' trees which are made from real parts as well as artificial parts to form trees. Go see for yourself if you haven't been there yet.",,
,,SUPERBE !,5,,"Impossible to stay in Singapore without going to Gardens by the Bay. Very nice attraction, with lots of different things to do....you will need more than 1 day if you want to enjoy fully all...",,
,,Beautiful place to spend an evening,5,,"We hung out at Indochine Roof top bar which offers stunning skyline of Singapore and had dinner at the restaurant below. Good food, good experience dining at high elevation inside a (metal) tree.",,
,,Lovely sunflowers!,5,,"Excellent preservation, presentation and display of sunflowers. I had no idea that there were so many varieties to be seen. Combined with the forest dome, it was a great family experience!",,
,,Absolutely amazing,5,,"We visited the gardens twice. Once in the evening but were too late to enter the domes, but we did see the fantastic light show. This was absolutely amazing and very well done.

We returned the next day to see the gardens properly and did no regret this. The gardens are beautiful and very well planned. Fabulous information about these and the importance of saving the environment. Very informative and enjoyable.

The only downside was the eating area. The hype was good, but we found this to be very disappointing.",,
,,Beautiful night under the stars.,5,,"I visited these gardens at night where we settled on the grass and waited for the show of the Trees to begin. This was just beautiful and relaxing listening to the jazz music and gorgeous light show which was so colourful. They change the music and colours every week or so. This is a must to visit when you are in Singapore. Then take a stroll around the beautiful gardens, you won't be disappointed!",,
,,Indoor Botanical paradise with spectacular views of Marina Bay Sand !,4,,Garden by the bay is a great place to spent time to recharge yourself a bit. There were a wide varieties of florals to explore and learn. I was so amazed and excited to see everything surrounded. Such a huge botanical with great landscape. Don't miss Cloud forest it's worth going up there and walking down was fantastic. They have elevator available. I have quite a limited time so miss the OCBC skyway.,,

,,Instagram-worthy visit,4,,"Located at Singagore's scenic waterfront, Gardens by the Bay is certainly worth a visit for all foreign and local visitors. This new branch of the Singapore Botanic Garden boasts an impressive climate-controlled Flower Dome & Cloud Forest with regular themed flower shows. Although I am not a big fan of the clusters of gigantic Sky Trees as I find them a bit artificial and imposing, the amazing bio-diversity and beautiful landscaping is still a good enough reason to pay a visit for any first time or repeating visitors to Singapore.",,
,,"A must see for tourist, a family place for residents.",5,,"We had 2 consecutive years' annual membership, Gardens by the Bay gets the whole family entertained. The kids love the water play, we love the aircon (laughing), my mother-in-law loves the flowers and my father-in-law loves photography. It's suitable for a visit for hot days and rainy days, and of course holiday seasons such as Christmas. We've been there every year since our kids are born. It's an amazing place. Parking is considered easy too, given the huge car park space.",,
,,Piece of Greenery in a Busy Town,4,,"I went there in a bright daylight, it was hot but worth the view. Despite the business in the city, it's nice to have an area where we can check out all the green views for relaxing purpose.
Not to mention, the view at night was quite breathtaking",,
,,Excellent gardens,5,,"Take a day to explore these wonderful gardens, and include the 2 domes remember that there is a light & music show at dusk",,
,,Lights-on Garden,4,,"Gardens by the bay is a very unique garden with beautiful tree-like structures (iconic ones you see in most pictures). In day light, these are just ordinary but the real magic begins in the evenings. The tree lights are turned ON and it looks more attractive. Best time to visit is in the early evenings. These are musical light shows twice everyday for about 10-15 mins. You can go to the sky-bridge which is just a bridge connected between 2 trees (it can be fun specially for a family). There are even small garden trails to explore the nature with some info of types of flowers and insects and nature in general (if that鈥檚 you thing).",,
,,Beautiful Gardens in the CITY Centre,5,,"Fantastic place to visit - you can see so many varieties of trees and plants from different countries.
Flower dome and Waterfall dome are worth visiting - buy the 2 in1 package.
Allow about 2 hours each to slowly enjoy the 2 domes.
Suggest to visit the domes from 2 to 6pm. After that, view the outdoor areas till evening when the lights come on - totally different feelings and views.
Can also have dinner at nearby Satay Club - plenty local foods.",,
,,Great place for all ages,5,,"Very huge place. The indoor domes are great for those who enjoy flora but not the hot and humid weather in Singapore. The domes are very cold so do bring along a sweater for young kids and elderly. Outside the domes, you can enjoy hundreds of flowers free of charge. They have this fun water play for the kids. Free of charge too. Remember to bring extra clothing and towels.",,
,,Amazing and interesting experience,5,,"A wonder you must visit. Everything inside a beautifully butterfly dome and it air con. Now they are doing Christmas decorating and will change according to festive. Most importantly you can see plant that can survive in tropical climate, It also well taken care of. A must to go if you are coming to Singapore",,
,,Two trips during one visit - as enjoyable as the first to Gardens by the Bay,5,,We visited Gardens by the Bay twice in October and November 18 to see the two different exhibitions in the Flower Dome with our 6 year old grandchildren. They loved the Wizard of Oz exhibition and got excited (a little too early) about Christmas when the exhibition changed to a Christmas theme. It makes a really good visit for families and individuals. You don't have to pay to see much of the garden (including a free water park for children where they can run around under spraying water and have buckets of water tipped over their heads from an orchid flower). The flower dome and cloud forest you have to pay for but it is worth it - although the coffee shop in the flower dome is expensive - we wait until we are down where the other eating outlets are!.,,
,,Loved the Garden Rhapsody...,5,,"I'd lived in Singapore for 4 years before I knew about the Garden Rhapsody, and which Id known sooner. What an amazingly lovely experience. I had first seen dancing fountains in Las Vegas, and then enjoyed them over and over again in Dubai. Discovering dancing lights in the Gardens when my uncle from Australia told me about them (!!!) was a beautiful surprise. Get there a little early to snag a garden bench to enjoy them properly, or take a blanket to sit on. We finish off with a drink at the rooftop bar at Supertree by Indochine.",,

,,Worth visiting. Outdoor and indoor good attractions,5,,The outdoor gardens are good and require 2-3 hours easily. The two domes that are paid attractions are equally good. The cloud forest is my favourite. Easily you can spend 3-4 hours here... must watch during Singaoore trip,,
,,"Fantastic, awesome place to visit",5,,"If you are going to visit the gardens by the Bay, the best time to arrive is late afternoon, this gives you time to see everything, walk the raised platforms (not to be missed) and stay for the evening light show.",,
,,Beautiful surroundings.,4,,"Entered the gardens from the meadow area and was a long walk in heat to the be in main area. Walking through planted areas and lakes past living skyscrapers to the huge greenhouses. The is no charge for the main gardens just the indoor areas, which are surprisingly cool in side.
You can take an audio tour ride around the out door gardens which is certainly better in the heat to see more.",,
,,Must visit,5,,"I think everyone who visits Singapore will come here and you won't be disappointed.

The main attraction is the trees and the domes. The domes are wonderful, and air conditioned! The cloud dome is more worthwhile I think compared to the flower dome, but personal choice. The cloud dome has waterfalls, heaps of flowers too, and is a nice walk down from the top.

Buy tickets online the day before to save you a lot of money. We bought some tickets, can't remember what site but had to collect them in person at a small shop in Marina Bay Sands lobby, so make a note to double check if you need to do this as well,they won't accept confirmation on your phone. The ticket got us into both domes and the treetop walk.

We timed the tree top walk with one of the light shows, well worth it for a different view. Don't go up if you are afraid of heights though. There are only a couple of light shows each night and both are the same.

There is a bit of shelter around if it rains, and some restaurants too.",,
,,"A ""Must See"" In Singapore",5,,"The gardens cover about a hundred hectares but the stars are the :Super Trees"", the garden Dome and the Cloud Forest. We didn't do the tree walk or stay and see them lit up at night as we wanted to focus on the Garden Dome and the Cloud Forest. These two domes are incredible in their size and scope and the Garden Dome is the largest hot house in the world. While the gardens are free, it was worth every cent to enter the two domes. A ""Must See"" In Singapore",,
,,nice views,4,,the gardens were really pretty and colorful. iconic man made stuff. went there expecting to spend only a few hours but wow,,
,,Amazing,5,,Wow what a set up...went thinking We would only be a hour there...4 hours later Just incrediable! So much to look at and planned out so incredibly. Something for everyine even if your not into plants you will still enjoy and be amazed.,,
,,A garden lovers paradise,5,,Visited with four friends and was just brilliant . The garden displays were unbelievable - were able to see the christmas displays so bright and colourful . I could easily off spent several days here wandering around .,,
,,Truly amazing!,5,,You have to give yourself a full day to see everything the Gardens by the Bay has to offer. We were limited with time but what we managed to see was just stunning. If you love gardens then this will blow your mind.,,
,,"zero expectations, great experience",4,,"I came with my mother, who is a great garden enthusiast. We did the 8 dollar bus orientation tour, which was worth it because my mother is 73 and because it started pooring down.
We went to the dome with the waterfall, and while at entry I was unimpressed, it turned out to be amazing. Unfortunately my mum was to tired after walking the first dome for us to see the next dome. We had bought the combo-ticket, but the staff were so kind to refund us the second dome. Great service. Next time we will come back to see the other dome.
One point for improvements are the eating places at the reception area. A dudgy cafe and a McD. Hope they will but something nicer there for my next visit!",,
,,Amazing,5,,"My wife and I visited the flower dome and the cloud forest in ""Garden by the Bay"". We had heard many recommendations to visit there and we were not disappointed.
The garden and forest displays are truly amazing.
A walk through the two domes is a 'must do' for any visit to Singapore.",,
,,Amazing Gardens,5,,"Visited the gardens by night and day. Day was definitely better, less crowds and you could see the detail better in the daylight. Well worth a visit.",,
,,Great day out,4,,Excellent air-conditioned observatories and a great water playground for kids. Could use a bit more (and healthier!) food options though.,,
,,Well worth a visit,5,,"Definitely a place to visit during you're trip , lovely by day and equally worth a visit at night for the light show.",,
,,Well worth a visit,5,,Had a splendid morning at the Gardens. Plenty to see in the gardens and then there is the glass houses and treetop walkway. A must visit if in Singapore.,,
,,Could spend the whole day here,5,,"100% worth doing whilst in Singapore.
There is loads here to see and do. A majority of Gardens by the Bay is free (other than the two Domes and the tree grove walk). However, this still leaves loads to do and see free of charge, including a water play area for children.
I would recommend doing both Domes and the Tree Grove walk as they are all well worth the price.
If you are looking to take some cover from the Singapore heat, then this is definitely the place to take it. Each Dome is very cool.",,
,,Wonderous Gardens,5,,The Gardens by the Bay lives up to the hype. Beautifully built and maintained. Much of the garden can be seen for free. I paid for the Cloud Forrest and Flower dome and it was worth it. A nice cool place to escape the heat and beautifully done. The cloud forrest is especially unique and impressive.,,
,,High-Tech Nature,5,,"An incredible futuristic mock-up of natural wonders which actually don't have much nature in it ... but we liked it. It's educational, fun, entertaining, ... you name it.",,
,,Well thought out layout,4,,The gardens surrounding the two domes where you have to pay entrance fees are free and well worth wandering around. If you catch the shuttle from the MRT station for three dollars return you鈥檒l save your energy to explore the gardens themselves. Well tended plants and interesting info as you walk around the well designed layout make it an interesting visit. We were surprised at how few people were actually in this part of the site compared to the crowds around the two domes.,,
,,Free,5,,The gardens outside is free of charge and beautiful. You have to see it for yourself. You can just sit and relax. Wear comfortable shoes and clothes. There was a McDonald鈥檚 outlet I saw. The souvenir shops nice also.,,
,,A lovely day out!,5,,Very worthwhile. Lots to see and the whole garden is so well kept . Beautiful! Don't rush it - buy a ticket and spend the day enjoying this oasis of peace and beauty.,,
,,Tsumthing to say.,4,,"If the theme display could include various gardens without changing the key landscape of these gardens, a common theme in the flower Dome could be achieved. On top of that, the pipe in music could have been playing only songs connected to Tsum Tsum only. At such, visitors will leave the dome with the revolving impression of Tsum Tsum with the main display of Flower Dome casted deep in their mind.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"Amazingly beautiful, light show was a treat. Didn鈥檛 expect the vast number of plants in the conservatories.",,
,,A must see attraction when visiting Singapore,5,,"We were overwhelmed by the beauty, and attention to detail in what has to be one of the best botanical exhibits in the world. We spent two half days exploring this botanical wonderland which is a credit to this small but amazing country. Well done Singapore.",,
,,Fantastic,4,,We had visited this place for fee hours. The location is nice. Great for photos. There are lots of rest areas if you're a bit tired. Good ambiance.,,
,,Garden by the Bay was wonderful and ecating expirence.,5,,"One has to go there and see it its just maid blowing thing,. We loved it. We walk around and took so many pictures, take you time to enjoy the wonderful things",,
,,Amazing Gardens by the Bay,5,,"We bought our tickets directly from the website of Gardens by the Bay. Absolutely no problem buying on line. The place was amazing, well staffed and well kept.",,
,,Good place for whoever love flower and plants,4,,"Good place for whoever love flower and plants.
I've been here for 4 times. when i have elderly friends who visit Singapore, I always bring them to here. there are different themes during the year in different time, so wont be get bored. remember to bring jacket as inside the dorm is abit cooler.",,
,,Fabulous Experience.,5,,"New and Ever green evergreen experience for our whole family. Our Children enjoyed the whole GB, for them is really GB opening new world in their view of experience.",,
,,worth every second,5,,"It's a must visit place in Singapore, suit for every age. You will be enjoy the view so much without regret.",,
,,Amazing but expect crowds on the weekend,5,,Amazing and spectacular! I suggest going on a week day. Saturday was busy and crowded. Also allow plenty of time to take it all in!,,
,,Holiday,5,,This is amazing well worth a visit we did it as part of a night tour so we could see the marvellous light show Singapore does it well Hardens in done are unbelievable Lyn,,
,,Cloud forest,5,,The place was very nice. It was part of the tour package we got. We started at the top and climbed down. The view was really good.,,
,,Very Calming Place,4,,A nice place to spend the evening at and have a bite to eat. Nice lighting at night. The bridge walk is a little narrow especially when everyone is trying to take photos. A glass walkway would have been a cool idea.,,
,,Must do in Singapore,5,,"Gardens by the Bay are a fantastic attraction to see in Singapore whether you are here for a few days or longer.

The Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are both extremely well designed and you could spend at least an hour at each even if plants aren鈥檛 your thing.

The sheer size of Super Tree Grove is breathtaking and I would highly recommend the light show that is on every night.",,
,,"Great place, don't missed the night light show",5,,"The cloud dome is very big and has a lot of plants there. Unfortunately we went at night so we've missed many detail of the plant esp in forest dome, it's too dark.
The light show at night is very fascinating. I recommend to brings some picnic mat so you can lie down and see the show.
ps it's cold in cloud dome, pls bring a jacket",,
,,The future is here,5,,"Amazing, magical, no word to describe this place. I didn't like the show, too touristic and too noisy, I can't understand the sense of a brit American 80's playlist. In such a place I would prefer something more elegant.",,
,,Huge gardens with many extra attractions within,5,,"Lovely gardens to wander in. The extra attractions of the Supergrove, cloud and Flower Domes are worth the extra cost to explore fully.",,
,,Beautiful collection,4,,We only able to spend half day in this beautiful complex. This is an attraction that worth a whole day to explore especially if you are photographers. We booked our admission on line which include hotel pick up and it works smoothly. I would not mind to visit this attraction again if I visit Singapore again.,,
,,Fabulous,5,,"A gorgeous, well set out garden with various elements to it. A magnificent way to spend time. Nearly most of it is free and close to an MRT. But...

Exhibits charge for entry, the train shittle charges, the numerous eateries are expensive. And it is Indonesian selfie central. I think I got loads of free entertainment from the plentiful picture taking and complicated hand gestures at their faces. Made for a surprisingly wonderful atmosphere actually!

What amazed me was how my 13yo son enjoyed his visit there. A jaded soul who finds his lame mum's activities boring, he really loved being at the gardens too. People whizz by on their e-gadgets, people from all over the world talking in languages he'd never heard before, various species of plants he had seen only in books, and the futuristic ferl of the giant trees sparked his interest.",,
,,Must do,5,,"This is Singapore at its best and it鈥檚 air conditioned in parts so you have some rest bite from the heat. Magnificent, a must see.",,
,,A unique place,5,,It has an amazing collection of plants and it really makes you feel that you are actually in nature. Definitely must visit if you are in Singapore. It's a place that is suitable for all ages and everyone can enjoy!,,
,,Awesome,5,,"I went to the Gardens by the Sea as a planned destination, i had the luck of having timed my visit perfectly, sheer luck but based it on the time of the sunset..Took the hop on and off tour bus. I had purchased my ticket at the airport for two attractions that included the cloud forest and flower dome and the night safari. I would say that it was an excellent visit,. Time your visit so you can go to the OCBC when it turns dark after sunset and the Super Tree comes alive, with light and sound,",,
,,Brilliant light show,5,,"We went to see the light show in the evening. Absolutely magical. Get a space beneath one of the big trees, lie back and enjoy the spectacle.",,
,,Gardens by the bay,5,,"The worlds largest greenhouse. It was amazing and well worth a visit, with tropical plants from all over the world, not just plants but trees and waterfalls and more.",,
,,Fantastic,5,,"Not to be missed- and especially the evening music show - the trees come alive to the music show which was the Musicals - so we had cats /Phantom/ jersey boys to name a few - so worthwhile seeing it so maybe go in afternoon and don鈥檛 miss this started at 7.45 and 8.45
Just fantastic",,
,,Beautiful attraction!!,5,,Get here by 5pm to see everything as the close at 8pm. Bring comfy walking shoes as there is lots of ground to cover.,,
,,Good show!,5,,There is some light show at 8 PM it was very good with laying on the floor and watching the lights. I love it! <3,,
,,Breathtaking,5,,The combination of nature together with impressive man made objects and architecture was really quite breathtaking.,,
,,Disappointing,3,,"At a distance, these are a sight to behold, with massive domes rising into the skyline. Up close, to us, these were a little less impressive with a distinct lack of clear directions around the flower done and unbelievably poorly policed queueing system in place to get to the top of done in the cloud dome. The flower dome was full of young girls taking endless selfies giving no consideration for anybody actually interested in the plants. Unfortunately we left a little underwhelmed.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,We came here after seeing the flyer for it. We walked around and decided to come back for the light show of an evening. It was absolutely magnificent. In sync with the music. A fine spectacle. I would highly recommend coming.,,
,,Must visit in Singapore,5,,"It is a very pretty place which offers a lot to every person of different interest. There is a public place which has a beautiful view of the Singapore flyer, Marina Bay sands, lake at the entrance. Further inside, there are super trees which are the uniqueness of this garden. It is very well maintained and clean. There are two domes inside viz cloud forest and flower dome which has a paid entry. You may consider paying it depending on your interests. Both the domes are pretty. Also, there is a light and sound show at the supertree area which is free. Timings are 7.20 and 8.20 which runs for about 10-15 minutes. It is a must watch. Overall, you should not miss this place.",,
,,Absolutely AMAZING,5,,"This place is incredible, you definitely need to visit the flower dome and cloud zone. Pay the extra its worth it, however the sky walk is a little over rated. If you have the opportunity to visit this place by day and night you won't be disappointed... i think at night the flower dome came to life. And certainly now until Christmas is the time to visit, as it's set up for Christmas.",,
,,Don鈥檛 miss the light show,5,,The attraction itself is breath taking but not until you see the light show. Many things to see inside that requires you paying a couple of dollars but otherwise it is free. Light show is available everyday at 7:30PM. Pictures are great as well at that time. Highly recommended!,,
,,Amazing day out,5,,"Start in the mid morning with Flower dome , than cloud forest , and pop in for a late lunch , and finish it of with the super grove tree at 7.15 and 8.15 every night. truly amazing.",,
,,Beautiful peaceful gardens,4,,"A peaceful walk around these tranquil gardens is a great way to forget about the hussle and bussle of Marina Bay. If you can stand the heat and humidity, it's well worth spending an hour or so in the gardens.",,
,,Amazing,5,,This is truly amazing place - no wonder it has received so many awards. It's worth taking the audio tour (S$8) first to get an overview of everything including all the ecological aspects of the construction and operation of the complex. You can then decide your priorities to view as you could be there all day and not see enough. We went twice as our first visit was interrupted by a thunderstorm. The Gardens are an educational triumph typical of the way the country presents itself to the world. The Domes are fantastic although the Flower Dome was closed when we visited - but we have been inside on a previous visit to the city. There are plenty of places for refreshments. There are great views of the city and Marina Bay from around the walkways.,,
,,Amazing Gardens,5,,A truly wonderful place to spend a day and stay for the evening light show. A must is to climb the stairs or take the lift to the treetop walk and admire the views over the park.,,
,,Something not to be missed.,4,,"We loved the Cloud Forest and the light show at Supertree Grove excellent. There was a pick up cart from Marina Sands MRT that takes you to the domes entry at a charge of $3 pp, well worth saving the 15minute walk in the heat.",,
,,Best experience on protecting the environment,5,,"We came to Garden by the Bays in the group with 3 people. It is very nice to see lots of plants around us and the atmosphere is really good. We really impressive about the way they keep different plants in the same condition as well as the artificial mountain ( or cliff) inside the Cloud Forest room. That is the great experience to see how fresh nature is. We have learn some lesson about protecting the environment. Thanks a lot !!

P/s: Good place to take perfect photo

Highly recommended for those loved environment!!!",,
,,One time visit,3,,Nicely constructed on a unique concept....preferable to go during evening as most of the area is in open...also there is a light show near by daily at 8 pm and 9 pm...which you can see after exploring the gardens,,
,,So Beautiful,5,,"This place is magical...so breathtakingly beautiful. The Cloud Forest is extremely impressive and an absolute must see...the waterfall at the entrance is stunning! The Flower Dome on the other hand was disappointing...dare I say, we could have skipped it an not felt like we missed anything. Now the SuperTree Grove...just wow... what more is there to say?!

QUICK TIP: Try to visit the gardens later in the day going into the evening as it starts to get dark so that you can experience both the day and night views as there is a vast difference! The gardens and cloud forest at night is definitely not to be missed! Also, there is a nightly light show with music in the SuperTree Grove at 7:45pm & 8:45pm that is a must see, make sure to arrive 10-15 minutes early to get a good spot!",,
,,A MUST DO!,5,,"This was simply amazing! If you go to Singapore, get the full entry to all parts of this attraction (domes) and plan to spend some time here. (Klook have good deals). You must stay for the light and music show too - Supertree Grove.",,
,,Gardens by the bay-delightful,5,,"We probably didn't see enough of the gardens as we arrived late afternoon,after a busy day. What we saw was good and the light show fantastic. Left me with a desire to return, so much more to see.",,
,,Well balanced attraction,4,,"I read the reviews of those who had crowd problems so I went as it opened at 9am. I visited the cloud forest first. Amazingly beautiful and not at all rushed. There must only have been about ten of us in there.

The flower dome had a few exhibitions aimed at kids. If you are taking your family I would think that you would spend more time there.

Do spend some time in the surrounding park. The free exhibits are really good although the Singapore heat and humidity does make it a little uncomfortable.",,
,,Excellent way to fill up 1/4 day - Beautiful surroundings,5,,"This is a site you will most likely want to visit in conjunction with a walk to the Marina Bay Sands - perhaps take the elevator to the top & check out the bars for a cocktail & views.

The walk through the Gardens by the Bay is in itself an excellent way to build up to the other attractions - incl the Super Trees in the same area & as I mention, the Marina Bay Sands.

Its a fabulous, pristine garden area meticulously maintained by the super hard working folks - it really is spotless.
So many varieties of plants & trees beautifully landscaped & manicured & perfectly planted along the pathways.

Its a great way to either spend 1/4 day for the gardens alone - or make a day of it and combine other sites in close proximity.

Well worth it.",,
,,Visited in the middle of the day and had a great experience,5,,2 Great halls to see plants and flowers from all over the world. advantage was that is real very quiet and you can see everything very close. Had a great time.,,
,,well worth a visit,5,,"We visited this place one evening, the light show and music that accompanied it was incredible.
Well worth a visit if you get chance but be warned at the end of the light show taxis are as rare as rocking horse *%""!.

Use the MRT instead.",,
,,Do not miss the cloud forest,4,,The cloud forest should not be missed!!!!!! A beautiful and very informative display The plants particularly orchids for sale in their shop are also very nice,,
,,Amazing,5,,Must see!!!! Like nothing you have seen before I got there only when it got dark but maybe worth getting there a bit before while there's still day light,,
,,Marvelous,5,,"It鈥檚 incredible what men can do. You get in there and is like be in a Forrest. There are 2 of the gardens, one is world wild and other is the humid forest. So beautiful, so fantastically groomed, plants from all the world is there in perfect harmony, you can connect with different parts of the world and get inspired for your next travel!",,
,,Evening Visit,4,,"We only managed to visit here in the evening to see the light show so did not see everything. The light show was enjoyable, bring something to lie on if you don't want neck ache. Plenty of people were lying on the ground looking up at the display.

As mentioned we only saw the light show but wandering round after it did seem a bit commercialized.",,
,,Best part is free,5,,"A wonderful few hours, the paid for parts (Cloud Forest and Flower Dome) are interesting and worth a look, but the best part was the light show in the Supertree Grove and that is free to visit! It鈥檚 on at 7:45pm and 8:45pm daily and can be a little kitschy but do yourself a favour and check it out!",,
,,Awesome!!,5,,It was awesome. There are plenty of plants and tress from across the continent to see. Its maintained well. Very beautiful. For botany lovers you can easily spend one full day here. The evening light show which is free for everyone was absolutely fantastic.,,
,,Heaven on Earth,5,,"This ppace is incredible - endless options of plants and flowers. The flower dome was decorated for Christmas when I visited, which was magical. The cloud forest is so amazing you almost forget its a man-made waterfall.
Supertree Grove offers amazing view of the Marina Bay Sands and the flyer.",,
,,Heaven on Earth.,5,,"This place is incredible - endless options of plants and flowers. The Flower Dome was decorated for Christmas when I visited, which was magical. The Cloud Forest is so amazing, and you completely forget that this is a man-made waterfall.
Supertree Grove is phenomenal, and offers amazing view of Marina Bay Sands, the Flyer and the bay front.
This is definitely a must hen you visit Singapore, and you can spend several hours without getting bored or tired.",,
,,Unusual and Different,5,,"What a sight with the tree tops, open spaces, two tall.and big domes. Its as much green spaces as you could imagine with easy walking distance between the domes and other attractions in the Garden. Best be prepared with water and snacks.",,
,,Free,5,,"Must do :) Really easy to get to, safe and fun. Heaps of things to see and explore and easy on the wallet",,
,,Stunning,5,,Compared to the appalling service offered at Marina Bay Sands this place was great. Skywalk was interesting.,,
,,Amazing view,5,,"The view at right from the board walk is amazing. Such a unique experience that even my 14 & 10 year old loved. The gardens are perfectly presented and immaculately clean. Yes, the lines can be a little long but they move quiet quickly & the experience is well worth the wait.",,
,,Good visit,4,,"We visited previously 2 years ago and our main impression was of the increased maturity of the planting. Everything seemed so much greener! Delightful gardens in which to spend time and enjoy the vistas, particularly along the water's edge.",,
,,Unique,5,,"If one thinks of only high rises and posh buildings, getting to the Gardens by the bay is a breath of nature at its decorative best",,
,,Wonderful experience!,5,,Gardens by the bay are a great addition to Singapore and a really nice experience even though it is filled with too many tourists! We went for the light show in the evening and also to the botanical garden which was ok but not really with the extra money. The gardens are free to walk around and there is a hawker centre with delicious food options too. Very pretty evening show with the lights and music I think it is twice each evening. Try and get to an area with marina bay sands in the background for an even more epic view,,
,,Beautiful,5,,"A great place to relax and sit just by looking at the flowers and plants. Good for family groups, yound and adult will really enjoy the views. Its a centralized airconditioned dome so don't worry about the hot weather of singapore.",,
,,Great visit,5,,"Brilliant, we went late afternoon and stayed for the evening light show. Superb visit, the flower dome and cloud dome great to walk around even our 14 year old son enjoyed it.
Went up to the skywalk just as dusk was falling, the bridge is wobbly but felt safe. You have to keep moving so don't get long up there but worth it for views of Singapore.
Not to be missed is the light and music show - fantastic!",,
,,Something different!!!,5,,"Very well planned and integrated into the vast Marina Bay Sands complex. We did this as part of our visit to MBS during our last day in Singapore. You can spend a whole day in MBS and visit the Gardens by the Bay in the evening. The views of the articulations trees and the MBS hotel from here is breathtaking. Having done Dubai, and Hong King, Singapore has set itself apart with this feature. If you have limited time I would recommend doing first art if the day in the MBS mall, then and evening meal at one of the restaurants to get a good view of the skyline. We dined at Lavo, see separate review. We then walked toto Gardens by the Bay. We preferred the shopping experience at MBS compared to Orchard Road. Orchard Road was good but you need two days to see all the shops, it was just huge. MBS seems to more compact and the shops appear more accessible.",,
,,nothing special,4,,"coming from natural Bali, this garden felt a bit as a build city garden, it is nice to walk, but to pay to visit 'cloud garden' was nothing to wow and very expensive. THere are only plants and artificial waterfall.. but as I mentioned, not worth the money if you have seen natural waterfalls before.",,
,,A must!,4,,"You don鈥檛 have to be a great lover of plants to appreciate and enjoy a visit to Gardens by the bay. It has different sections to represent plants from around the world but doesn鈥檛 feel like a museum. Seasonal displays are impressive as is the cafe restaurant, pollen, which is well worth a visit to rest before walking some more. It鈥檚 all under cover which means you are always dry!",,
,,Not too bad,3,,"If you are flower or cactus lover you can visit Garden by the Bay since there are many species of fauna can be found there. You can also enjoy cloud forest main attraction is waterfall.

Overall it is good place for picture but for me this place was overrated. Just my personal opinion.",,
,,"Best garden in city, ever",4,,"Strongly recommended a visit, prepare for a lot of people in the two garden house. Otherwise everything is great",,
,,Romantic,5,,My bf and i took a tour around the area and it was really very beautiful - especially at night time. My favorite spot is that one with the dragonfly and the Super Trees.,,
,,Wonderful,5,,"The small dome garden is not impressive but the large dome is fantastic. Really recommend visiting this.
The gardens outside the dimes are very beautiful and the trees that are lit at night take your breath away. We went to the light show of these trees and really enjoyed it",,
,,1st visit and loved the time we had,5,,"it really was amazing to see, enjoyed the whole gardens by the bay , especially inside the two different dome and how clever it all was",,
,,Amazing place,5,,"This place really surprised me cause Singapore is a really city atmosphere and after beside has a this place is like transportation to other spot, really recommend in the nights with the light show is a beautiful experience.",,
,,must Visit,5,,"very artistically designed, but more importantly very well executed and maintained. the Dome structure is an engineering feat.",,
,,Be prepared for a lot of walking,5,,"Entry to specific parts of the garden such as Cloud Forest or Flower Dome are to paid separately, however, entry to the garden itself is free. There are a lot of places to relax and walk. Keep an eye out for cyclists in all directions. There is a lot of walking in the gardens. If you have limited time, do visit Cloud Forest or Flower Dome and catch the light show in the evening.",,
,,Nice Attarction,5,,"Nice Attraction to be visited in the evening time, just close to Singapore flyer, Kids enjoy it most.",,
,,Magical,5,,"We got to enjoy the magical experience of the light show displayed by the beautiful trees , we didn鈥檛 get the time to go into the cloud domes ! But would definitely return to the gardens n hopefully get into them next time , the light show and music is fantastic I really found this place magical such a beautiful feel wandering around amongst these super trees ! It鈥檚 a must see ! Was a highlight fir myself and my family",,
,,Amazing Urban Nature Scene!,5,,"The gardens are quite beautiful, the expanses of trees and grass are very tranquil. The Domes containing the Tropical vegetation and the Flowers presentations are amazing.",,
,,Words don't do it justice,5,,"Totally mind blowing the range and quantity of plants in this complex. The fact that it is so cool in the air con makes for a wonderful place to explore. The age and size of some of the plants is amazing, must be worth soooo much",,
,,Part of a night tour,5,,"We did the evening visit as part of a 3 part tour, the solo singer in the park playing Adele, Ed Sheran etc was good, set the mood, then the light show started where the tree structures lit up to music which lasted about 15 mins. Glad we went.",,
,,Amazing and beautiful,5,,These beautiful gardens are quite breath taking and at night the illuminated trees are awesome. We went to the cloud forest which are in the gardens which was great too,,
,,Good light show,4,,Visited in the evening and it was pretty spectacular to see the light and music show in the garden. Quite costly to see all the attractions but worth a trip,,
,,The best.,5,,The variety of plants are amazing. Nicely laid out and easy to get around. The light show you should make time to see.,,
,,Worth a visit,5,,Superb a most when visiting Singapore when later on and caught the free light show. Also go into the flower garden and rain forest worth paying extra to experience these amazing habitats. Also has many places to eat and drink with good transportation links.,,
,,Had the best time!,5,,"We went to Gardens by the Bay at night in time for the light show. After getting our tickets we waited just over 15min before we could join the line to go up the lift to the top of one of the Supertrees. When we got to the top the light show began. It was fantastic - the music and lights going on and off, changing colour and light pattern to the beat of the music. We then walked along the cable bridge between the supertrees. I highly reccomend doing the walk during the light show.",,
,,Awesome,5,,A wonerderful 7 hours of garden beauty and visual stimulation topped off by the Supertree light show. Incredible. An absolute must for all ages,,
,,Fantastic and so beautiful,5,,"Great place for a walk through beautiful gardens. We decided to buy tickets and go for a 20 minute audio assisted trolley ride and it was so worth it. We saw the whole garden than walk around a bit in our favorite part. The air feels so purified as you stroll down the paths. Hint = ticket is inexpensive, try a trolley ride",,
,,Beautiful diversity of plants and trees,5,,"Once in the botanical garden it is worth to do a guided tour to the inside of the largest greenhouse of the world, with everything from olive trees to araucarias from Patagonia. Worth the visit.",,
,,Wonderful to experience,5,,Was surprisingly delighted to visit this place as went with the presumption of it just being garden and trees. But the setup was majestic and the variety of flowers and trees across continents and time was great. A lot of walking to be done so ensure u have ur energy levels high. Also is linked to marina bay sands the hotel post which u can enjoy the rooftop cafe.,,
,,Must see Singapore attraction,5,,"On a recent trip to Singapore my husband and I visited the Gardens twice in one day - it was fantastic. In the morning we walked through both conservatories (which are air conditioned) and saw a variety of flora and fauna from all over the globe and then at night, returned for the light show - both very worthwhile things to do, even if you have limited time in Singapore. I'd allocate at least 1.5 -2 hours to walk around both conservatories as there is a tonne to see and you don't want to miss anything! The one recommendation I have is for the evening, make sure you allot enough time to get to the gardens. Traffic at night is horrendous and there are hordes of tourists and locals going to watch so make sure you allow enough time to arrive before the show starts.",,
,,Great place to take a walk!,5,,"It鈥檚 probably my 5th - 6th visit there and it hasn鈥檛 changed! It鈥檚 clean and altho it鈥檚 a huge place, the directional signages are well placed to help you navigate around.",,
,,Marvellous garden,5,,The sunflower fair was astounding with the numerous varieties of sunflowers. The dome itself was thankfully air conditioned & spacious even as the crowds started entering.,,
,,First stop you must see,5,,"The Cloud Forest is amazing. The waterfall and the trek from the top to the secret garden is so beautiful, we didn't want to leave.",,
,,Wonderful garden! but be careful about the maintenance day.,5,,"We visited the Cloud Forest on 30 Oct as the Flower Dome was closed for the monthly maintenance. On 29 Oct, the Cloud Forest was closed.So I understand that it is closed for one day every month and they are closed in turn. If you have limited time and you want to visit particular attractions within the Garden, check before you go. This place does need MAINTENANCE (note: it's in capitals) indeed. So much variety of plants, carefully planted, supported and taken care of. Just breath-taking!",,
,,Beautiful a must,5,,One of the great adventures to learn about nature and the beauty of design. The best light show with music. Amazing!,,
,,you can't have enough of it,5,,"The dreamy land 鈥?second visit yet seeing a different theme 鈥?it鈥檚 amazing how these people can be so creative with new visions everytime 鈥?hats of to the designers of the gardens.
We had to rush as we had only little time before we go to the airport 鈥?yet it was worth it. Being splashed by the waterfalls, enjoying the lovely flowers 鈥?great time spent
Highly recommended",,
,,Unforgettable and faultless,5,,"We enjoyed a 1 night stay at the hotel as part of a 3 day break in Singapore. Certainly not cheap as far as hotels go but with good reason - it is exceptional and for what you enjoy, it represents good value for money. I recommend the pool on a nice day with the best view in South East Asia. We had a premier room with a breathtaking garden view. Will certainly visit again if I'm lucky enough to return to Singapore in the future.",,
,,A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!,5,,"Such a beautiful place to visit... recommend it at night, looks like a fairy wonderland. You will get the most colourful, amazing photos! The Super Grove tree night shows were really special. Recommend it to all visitors particularly families, great to sit on the lawns at night and watch the light show.",,
,,Sunflowers,5,,Very nice & cooling. Nice to see so many breed of sunflowers in 1 place. Had a nice time taking pictures of the flowers & with the flowers,,
,,Amazing attractions under the domes.,5,,"On a recent visit to Singapore my wife and I dedicated a full day to Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by the Bay. It was a full and amazing day. Apart from the magnificent and towering Marina Bay Sands hotel, the lush gardens behind the hotel offer another world of enjoyment. The gardens are crisscrossed by well maintained pathways linking several themed areas. The standout features are the Supertree Groves and the two futuristic glass domes.
The Supertrees are linked by a skywalk that links one to another to give a spectacular view down into the gardens. At the time of writing it was $8 to walk the skywalk.
The two domes are the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest; both equally impressive. The Flower Dome is packed with plants and flowers from all corners of the globe, and again there are many themed areas such as Yellow Brick Road and Alice in Wonderland.
The Cloud Forest dome surprises you as you enter; being confronted by a 100 foot waterfall. You can walk around another skywalk inside the dome and into the waterfall to admire the vegetation and artificially generated clouds below.
Our recommendation is to spend a full day, preferably weekday, in this precinct. Explore the Flower Dome in the morning and the Cloud Forest in the afternoon. Then rise to the Observation Deck at the Marina Bay Sands hotel before taking a dinner break. Then take in the free lightshows; one at the Supertree grove and the other in front of the hotel.
You will not forget your day.",,
,,WOW.,5,,What a absolutely brilliant place to visit. Even if you are not necessarily a lover of all things green in the garden this place is a must visit. The attention to detail on not only the plants and gardens but also the finer detail of wood/tree carvings and the paths and landscaping. The array of plants and particularly the orchards is mind blowing. The dome with the water fall is just to spectacular to miss out on. I can鈥檛 say enough about this amazing place. Absolutely well worth the price of entry which I thought was quite moderate,,
,,Beautiful illumination show at 7:45,4,,"My last visit in Singapore was 2010. This is new place and new thing so I decided to go with my friend. Since it rained, the ground was wet, cannot lie down to watch the show, performing in the air. But still very good to watch for 15 min. Only my neck became stiff a bit. Anyway, Good to see super trees鈥?show at night with all tourists from all over the world.",,
,,A place that everyone has to visit,5,,This is an incredible and impressive place to visit. The architecture and all the plants and features shown there are out of this world. Walking this whole place reminded me what a beautiful planet we have.,,
,,Beautifully crafted gardens,5,,We spent most of the day here. The cloud dome was the highlight and the views from the walkway in the sky was great. The giant trees and the Marina Sands hotel are man made marvels. This is an attraction not to miss on a visit to Singapore,,
,,Illuminations and music at night,5,,Enjoyed the illuminations and music of the evening shows though it was shorter than we had expected. Very simple to get there and away by public transport and it was even free!,,
,,Amazing Place,5,,I would love to go there again. I only spent an hour looking around in a golf buggy its another place have to visit. Worth the money.,,
,,A must see in Singapore,5,,"Entry is free but you then pay for the ""big"" attractions such as the Cloud Forest and Tree-top walk. Top 5 activity for Singapore.",,
,,Scenic and enjoyable,5,,"Gardens by the bay is exactly what you expect from reviews and pictures. A very nice way to spend a couple of hours in their air conditioned conservatories.
The flower dome is a little dull but is more than made up for by the cloud forest.
Educational, eye opening and very pretty!
Also great for photo opportunities.
I went at 9am on a Thursday morning and it was fairly quiet besides a few school groups.",,
,,You pay for what you want,4,,There is no doubt that the Gardens by the Bay are beautiful and well maintained. However we paid for the $3 tram ride which stopped at the cloud forest & flower dome only to find you paid an expensive price to enter each of these spaces. For those of us lucky enough to live in a climate that has wonderful natural flora I really don鈥檛 think this is worth the cost. The botanical gardens & orchid house are much better value. Only positive was that it was close to marina bay sands.,,
,,Light Show!,5,,Gardens by the Bay has two light shows in the evening which are great to see and free. You can pay extra to go into the domes or the skywalk but we were happy just seeing the show from the bottom as you get a very good view. Best to arrive 10-15 mins before the show to get a good spot.,,
,,Beautiful plants & scenery,4,,"Lovely day spent looking at the beautiful flowers, especially orchids. Great architecture within, as it is practically a living wall with massive waterfall. Went with 5, 10 & 15 year old. They did get bored, so only did one dome.",,
,,The Cloud Forest is amazing,5,,You need at least a full day to visit the garden. Flower Dome and especially the Cloud Forest are amazing. We catch also the Garden Rhapsody at 8:45 pm and it`s hard to describe in words. On the day it was also the Neon Jungle open.,,
,,Amazing,5,,Absolutely fantastic was blown away by the scale of the place from the gardens the flowers to the cloud dome waterfall spent a couple of hours in there it is absolutely beautiful,,
,,A little piece of nature,5,,"As a Singaporean who never really explores his city, it was nice to see what it has to offer. Honestly wouldn't have made the trip if my girlfriend didn't pester me, but it was well worth the money.",,
,,Wonderful garden experiences.,5,,"Highly recommend a visit to the Gardens by the Bay. We really enjoyed our time. It is well laid out and the gardens are impressive and immaculate. Entering the domes to see the amazing flower displays, provide a reprieve from the humidity.",,
,,A must visit,5,,This place is amazing. A visit to the Flower dome and Cloud Forest is a must do. Then catch the shuttle to Marina Bay Sands and visit The Sky Park. A Singapore Sling is the ideal drink whilst looking out over Singapore.,,
,,Flower Dome & Cloud Dome amazing,5,,Spectacular. Well worth the visit. We spent four hours wandering through the domes and outside gardens. Everything is so beautifully displayed and different plants from around the world. Children would love the cloud dome with its cascading waterfall and carvings of dragons and animals throughout the gardens. The flytrap garden had LEGO made flytraps. Fantastic.,,
,,Gorgeous!,4,,A must see on your visit to Singapore...even better at night with the light show. There is a sky walk that looks great and we found a bar high up in one of the trees with 360 degree views ( Super Tree bar),,
,,Forest in the City,4,,"This is quite a big place, so you need about 2-3 hours to properly appreciate the place. Expect a lot of outdoor walking so bring along a brollie if the weather is hot.
The place is free if you are just wandering around. However they charge Sing8.00 for getting up to the Supergrove skywalk (I reckon its well worth it). To get into the 2 domes, you have to pay Sing28.00. Lots of plants, flowers inside, all beautifully tended to. There is a tall waterfall to boot!",,
,,Great place to spend an afternoon and evening,5,,"Loved the Gardens by The Bay, the setttings are fantastic, spotlessly clean and great place to take your camera. Make sure you stay for the light show in the evening too.",,
,,Amazing!!,5,,This was such a wonderful place to visit. I'd suggest timing your visit for late in the afternoon so you can see the gardens & then settle back & enjoy the wonderful light show as the sky becomes dark.,,
,,Best!,5,,This Garden is exceptional. A very very good concept in the heart of the city. The flower domes are beautiful. The lighting effects are extravagant in the evening. Its worth a visit.,,
,,Must see gardens in Singapore,4,,"These huge gardens are amazing. There are two indoor domes and a huge parklike landscape full with beautiful flowers, trees, The domes contains all sorts of plants and flowers from all over the world, arranged in a spectacular environment, a tall waterfall included. If you like nature or making photos is your hobby then this garden is a must for you. There is a shuttle that can take you from the entrance to the domes. You can also walk to the domes, which is a pleasant walk in this amazing garden. Entrance is free. Shuttle is 3 dollar for unlimited rides. Tickets for going inside the domes is about 20 dollar. Beware tough: Good places to drink and eat are very scarce!",,
,,Naturally Superb,5,,Gardens by the Bay is one of kind place where you can spend hours admiring this beautiful creation by mankind. The light and music show in the evening is amazing and full of life. Overall its a must do attraction if you are in Singapore.,,
,,Great visit,5,,"Stunning, a must while in Singapore along side a visit to Marina Bay Hotel , good value for money !!!!!",,
,,Amazing!,5,,"This was on the top thing on our to-do-list while in Singapore. It really is worth it! People everywhere but that is to be expected. Went in both the domes, absolutely amazing",,
,,Very cool place! Stay for the light shows.,4,,"Obviously this is a must-do when visiting Singapore, and I'd seen photos so I knew basically what to expect. I'm glad we went just before sunset as it wasn't quite so busy. Not really any queues with the Cloud and Flower domes, which were both cool. I loved the Flower one as the had a Wizard of Oz theme going on. Really interesting concept, although the highlight for me was the Supertree Grove. The light show was amazing - great, upbeat music, a lot of musical numbers, and the lights were stunning! I'm so glad we did the skywalk too, and you get some amazing views. It was just very expensive once you pay for both domes, and the skywalk. But worth doing all!",,
,,An epitome of nature & technology,5,,The light and music show in the night at the Gardens is a must see for nature lovers. Every tower is a unique abode to hundreds of different species of flowers and plants including cacti.,,
,,nice place,5,,the place was very cool and we can move around as much as we want. everything was nice and pretty. my family enjoyed it here,,
,,Wonderful gardens,5,,Gardens by the Bay is an amazing place to just spend hours wandering about looking at the different gardens. The attention to detain is superb. All of this is free. At night there is a terrific light show. Another must see in Singapore.,,
,,Futuristic garden concept,5,,"We went towards the end of the day for the night lights at the supertree grove and it was totally worth it.
There are daily shows at 19:45h and 20:45h. It is possible to go up to the canopy walk as well (S$8, oct'18). Should you want to go there make sure the weather is good since they may close if bad weather. The cloud dome and the flower dome tickets cost S$28 for both, we didn't go in since we have visited the botanical gardens earlier that day.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,I took my kids here and it was amazing. Lovely place to spend some time walking around and making a day of it. Very busy and hot around here but worth the trip.,,
,,A Must Visit in Singapore,4,,This is something you must see when visiting Singapore. I would highly recommend hiring a scooter on this visit as there is quite a lot of walking but a bus service is also available around the gardens.,,
,,Just Awesome... Go and Get Amazed,5,,Two domes offers amazonian experience in urban places. At night get amazed by light show by SuperTrees. It is a must place to visit in Singapore.,,
,,Good place to relex and shighting in the Gardens by the Bay,5,,"You can make a whole day staying at the site. Morning and night are given you the whole different of views.
Don't go in the Dome in the morning, prefer by afternoon so you will not dehydrated in the hot sun. After the two dome, if still early you can have a drinks at the caf茅 but it will be slightly expansive.
Waiting for night fall, the outside of the area you can slowly walk and feel the lights shining from the dark.
Hope you enjoy the stay.",,
,,FANTASTICAL,5,,"Loved it. Must see at dusk for the best light. Amazing, futuristic, innovative and super special. We enjoyed the sky walk through the tree tops as well as the symphony in the gardens. A must see in Singapore but brace for crowds.",,
,,GBB,3,,"Pleasant and nice environment. Good for photographers. Unfortunately it's all fake. The current exhibits is limited. Toilets are few and have to walk quite a distant before you can locate one and no signages to lead you, keep having to asked the staff for directions. Best saving grace is that locals gets a special rate, kudos to that.",,
,,Bit of green next to the skycrapers,4,,"Beautiful gardens almost in the centre of Singapore. Including the beautiful super trees and two huge greenhouses. Garden itself is a free experience, but the super trees and greenhouses costs a bit. But yet again, totally worth it, the view from the trees is quite nice, and the greenhouses are gorgeous.",,
,,Impressive engineering works,5,,"An extraordinary and impressionant engineering, art work focused on beautifulness of the nature. Take your time, don't hurry. Please note that the entrance is free but you should pay for the Cloud Forest, Flower Dome (28$SGD combined ticket) and giant trees 8$SGD",,
,,Nice place to hang out,3,,This is nice place to hang out in the evening time. Especially the light and sound program is nice to watch.,,
,,A great place to visit,5,,The gardens are a amazing and a most if you visit singapore great layout easy to find your way around suitable for all ages,,
,,Spectacular!,5,,"Do not miss this when visiting Singapore. The Flower Dome has all the flora from the climate zone of Singapore and the other continents in the same belt. The Cloud dome has a spectacular waterfall as you enter. You travel by elevator to the top of the falls and descend down, being delighted by new visages along the way.",,
,,This is a great place to visit and remember to stay for the light and music show,5,,The flower and cloud domes are a must see and the rest of the gardens are lovely. You need to give yourself at least 5-7 hours to see everything.,,
,,Gardens by the bay,5,,"The gardens are truly one of the jewels of Singapore,it is an essential place to visit both during the day and at night.",,
,,Wonderful!,5,,Definitely a must-do in Singapore. Great for all ages. So interesting. Nice also to get out of the heat of Singapore.,,
,,This is absolutely spectacular,5,,"Wow - this would have to be one of the best attractions I have visited and I have travelled extensively. We spent several hours wandering and even on a wet, gloomy day this was nothing short of amazing.",,
,,Awesome,5,,This is a place straight out of wonderland. The best time to visit is post 3 pm so that you can stay till 8:30 for the fantastic light and sound show. This is a must visit. Enjoy the cloud garden and super grove.,,
,,First date feels,3,,"Came here for a first date and it was very romantic!! The atmosphere was right and the smell of nature is all around!! Love it, suggest you come at non peak days/hours!!",,
,,Amazing experience,5,,We had a super experience at this place and it鈥檚 worth going once. Children enjoyed it and it was absolutely value for money which we spent on tickets. A must watch when one going to Singapore.,,
,,Simply Beautiful,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is simply beautiful. The supertree is something to see as well. You can pay a fee to experience the walk on the bridge between the supertree. The garden is amazing, it can lead you to the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome which is highly recommended to experience, at least the Cloud Forest.

I will definitely be back, as the Gardens by the Bay is actually bigger than I thought so I highly recommend to make a lot of time for it.",,
,,Excellent place for flower lovers,4,,"This is a heaven for those love flowers and trees. You can easily spend 2hours walking around and takes hundreds of photos. If you pick the right season, you will see the special flowers on display.

I tried the cloud forest and flower dome, cost SGD28/adult for tourist. It is cheaper if you are citizen. You can re-enter the flower dome again and again on the same day with a ""re-entry"" ink chop on your hand at exit counter.

If you have extra time for their OCBC skywalk cost SGD8/adult, then don't miss it in the evening. You have will the beautiful lighting for your photos.

It is an interesting place to visit.",,
,,Don鈥檛 underestimate the size of this place,4,,"We went for the afternoon and needed to come back - get the park bus, complete the tour and don鈥檛 skimp on seeing the two indoor domes. You can also complete a canopy walk whilst the giant tree lights are on at night . Truely awesome",,
,,A huge and beautiful garden,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is unlike the conventional gardens or park. Built with the mindset of sustainability in mind, the Gardens marries environment and technology together.

The Gardens itself is huge. Comprised of free and paid admission areas, to really cover the entire place can take you at least 3 to 5 hours. You can walk to the Gardens from Marina Bay Sands or take the MRT to Bayfront MRT.

The most iconic areas of the Gardens is of course the Super Trees and the two conservatories, the Flower Dome and the Super Dome. All three areas require payment to access. For non-residents, you will need to pay between $20 to $50 depending on what areas you want to visit, but my recommendation would be to visit the two Domes at least. Residents pay a cheaper fare.

There are many beautiful photography opportunities around the Gardens though if you are visiting during the daytime, it may get a little warm and sweaty outdoor. So bring water, umbrella/cap and wear comfortable walking attire. There's a lot of walking involved. If you're feeling lazy however, you can always pay to take the shuttle transport.

There are also ample facilities here, so you don't have to worry about getting hungry. For the cheapest food option here, there is McDonald's.

If you're looking for something different, you can consider visiting the Gardens during the evening/night time, where there are light shows and a different perspective to the Gardens.

I would say that Gardens by the Bay is a definite must visit if you're in Singapore, though to make your trip here really worth it you have to check out the paid admission areas. Check out the reviews of the domes separately if you want to know more.

Highly recommended!",,
,,Spectacular,5,,Wow; what can we say ; this truly mastering garden art to the max. If you don鈥檛 experience this while in Singapore ; you will be skipping the highlight of the Singapore tourist as a tourist. Make sure to be around 4-5 pm and stay at the light show 7.45 under the supertrees; once again well done Singapore,,
,,Beautiful,4,,The gardens are very beautiful. It is worth to pay the entrance for the greenhouses. In the evening there are Lightshows in the artificial trees.,,
,,Must visit when in Singapore,4,,"Very special. Enjoyed very much. I found it to be a bit ""disney like"" , meaning a bit artificial. Still its one of must visits when in singapore.",,
,,Nice place to relax in thr evening,4,,There are 15 minutes shows everyday in the evening and the place is good to relax and free to enter. The light and sound effects are lovely.,,
,,So beautiful,5,,"This is a can鈥檛 miss place. Came here st night night and trees, lights, and gardens were like nothing I鈥檝e ever seen. Total eye candy. Pictures don鈥檛 do it justice. We came a night and only saw a small fraction of the gardens. He skywalk looked incredible but it was closing as we got there.

Pro tip: come walk the gardens from 6-8 then have cocktails/dinner at Spago on top of the marina bay sands hotel. You won鈥檛 be disappointed!",,
,,Wow,4,,first time i saw this famous place. in awe with the creation. it was a must see place in singapore. just few trains away from the city. singapore pride,,
,,Beautiful,5,,"We visited this place twice on our trip once in the day and then for the light show at night and it was amazing both times. The dimes of gardens are like nothing I鈥檝e ever seen and the light show and music was amazing, don鈥檛 miss this if you go to Singapore",,
,,Fantastic spectacle,4,,You really have to go here if you visit Singapore. The lights are fantastic. I was on a tour and we had a great view of it. Definitely recommended.,,
,,Must see,5,,One of the sights that are a must see when in Singapore. Take few hours and walk through the whole park and just relax. You can see lots of different flowers and plants that you havent seen before. Worth the money.,,
,,An entire afternoon through late night with family,5,,"Lots to do and lot of walking in this magical attraction created on reclaimed land.we reached here by cab from Little India and started exploring. we saw the flower dome first and then the Cloud forest. Both superb. Ideal to do this as you can escape the heat & humidity outside.

we then went to the Marina Bay sands tower for the view of the city. If you can make it here at around 6PM it will be perfecgt as you can see the natural lights as well as the city lights later on.

Post this we went to the Super tree grove for a walk & light show. This is a free attraction unless you want to climb & walk on the pathway at 25 to 30 ft. we did not do this. The light show was not worth the time unless you have the rest of the evening to kill..

Finally we went on a boat ride to the Clark Quay and back. One needs to walk a bit from the gardens by the bay to the location where the boat rides start. Ask for the Bayfront Avenue boardwalk where the boat rides start. Highly recommeded to do this in the night. Lots of eateries by the bayfront avenue and the mall inside. If you have the time you could get off near the Merlion statue and have dinner.",,
,,You should not miss,5,,"This is one of the nicest gardens all built under a glass roof. Beautiful flowers and plants, lots of information and views. There is an incredible movie about global warming which everyone must see. This garden is a highlight that everybody must visit especially families with kids",,
,,Worth a look,5,,Great place and leave a day free if your doing it all.there are waterfalls and a shopping centre nearby. Prices are reasonable to get into the attractions.,,
,,Good one to stroll around and watch the light show,4,,"A good garden to stroll around. Also watch the light show, go to the sky way on super tree grove(adult SG$8, Children(3-12)SG$5), flower dome(adult SG$28, Children(3-12)SG$15), cloud forest. Free gardens include - Sun pavilion, heritage garden, Super tree grove, world of plants and Dragonfly &Kingfisher lakes.Good to spend your evening watching the light show. There is an Indochine restaurant on the sky way if you want to have dinner.",,
,,Good to spend an evening!,4,,"These are worth a visit when in Singapore. Though man made attractions, the species of plants/flowers they have from all around the world are fascinating and informative. The 15 minute Light and Sound show is nice to end the evening!",,
,,Worth to visit,5,,Very nice place for family with kids.Place is surrounded by garden and also you may have take quick bite from Mcdonalds near by.,,
,,So much more than I expected,5,,"This is an amazing place. I am no gardener and just about manage to keep my house plants alive but Gardens by the Bay thrilled me with the plants, flowers and architecture. Time well spent.",,
,,Best Singapore view ever,5,,It鈥檚 was reale fantastic to go up on skypark to ha e a look Around. You Canazei ha e an incredibile view of the city from the top,,
,,A must to visit,5,,It was really a nice place but unfortunately i miss the beautiful tree because i bring my parents with me and they cant walk any farther :( but the flower dome and cloud forest is very beautiful. I dont know if i can go to the the tree garden or no because my ticket just say it just available for flower dome and cloud forest,,
,,Brilliant impromptu night walk,5,,Landed in the evening and wanted something to do before heading back to the hotel. This place is incredible and most of the areas has a free entry. Definitely go at night as the lit up trees are breathtaking,,
,,Okay,4,,"My second time here. Not a very big area, took us around an hour at the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. Nice flowers.",,
,,Gardens by the bay,5,,This was a beautiful place to visit. The various domes had different plants from around the world to view. There was a massive waterfall in one dome and dragons made from drift wood in another. Caters for all age groups. When the lights come on at night it is like fairy land. Make sure you go around to the food court area and have the chicken satay sticks. Delicious. Then walk to the Marina Bay Sands hotel to watch the water fountain light show that happens every night.,,
,,Simply amazing,5,,"Awesome place. We took the audio tour of the place which was very nice. Walking the whol3 place is not possible, it's just too big.
The main attractions are the forest dome, flower dome and the ocbc skyway light show. All of them were great. We specifically liked the the forest dome which boasts of talleat artificial waterfall in the world. The light show which happens 7:45 and 8:45 also was very good and its free too. You just go in and sit in the area where the who happens.
Overall great place for kids and elderly and for clicking pics. It can easily take 3-4 hours and beat time is to visit in the evening so that you can also catch the light show.",,
,,Spectacular wildlife,5,,We went to the Forest with the waterfall and it was amazing! Beautiful flowers and plats cover the whole inside 鈥渕ountain鈥?and waterfall.,,
,,Great ecological concept and enjoyable,5,,"This was our primary reason for visiting Singapore this time as the Gardens by the Bay are need since our last trip. We were not disappointed. Really interested in the ecological concept behind the park and fully support that message.
We spent a couple of hours during the day waking through the whole park, stopping for a cold drink up the super tree Indochina restaurant ( view is hampered somewhat by the purple super tree structure), and then onto the two cloud gardens; cloud forest and flower dome. Both of these are air conditioned so very pleasant environment to enjoy all they have to offer. We were given advice to make sure we got a re-entry stamp to the flower dome. This was the best piece of advice as seeing the Christmas display and northern lights projection at night was amazing.
We returned to the Gardens after 7:30 pm to see them all lit up. We didn't bother visiting the Christmas wonderland as it looked like children's amusement park rides and food stalls.
Well worth visiting both day and night. Use the $3 shuttle unlimited rides to take some of the walking out of your visit.",,
,,irenethepigmy,5,,Just visited the Gardens by the Bay. Fantastic. Unfortunately my time was limited there but you could spend a few days looking at all the beautiful plants inside and outside the domes. Was there early evening and watched one of the light shows from the platform walkway 7.45 pm and the other from ground level 8.45 pm. If in Singapore do not miss this.,,
,,Beautiful,5,,"We visited during the daytime and again at night , fabulous, loved this place , beautifully laid out and so tranquil , amazing , saw from the flyer too which gives another beautiful perspective",,
,,Awesome,5,,Totally blown away ... words cannot describe how amazing this place was... go... pictures do not do it justice,,
,,A must see,5,,"When on a business trip in Singapore, having some spare time a must see is the gardens by the bay.
Walk around in the area towards the sea where the temperature is nice.
We visited the 鈥淐loud forest鈥?with it beautiful orchids and lots of other fauna.",,
,,Disappointed,2,,"Im sorry but we were dissapointed with the gardens by the bay. The place is beautiful but we felt bored as we roam around its premises, it is too expensive and quite exhausting. The flowers etc. is not that special even the light show is not that amazing. I suggest that you should go to Sentosa Island instead of coming here. Do not waste your money with just a plain big garden.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay,4,,"My partner and I visited Gardens by the Bay and completed both domes in the afternoon.

If you only have the option to visit one, I would recommend the cloud forest with the indoor waterfall.

They also have a light show daily at 7:45pm & 8:45pm which was great. From here, you also get a nice view of Marina Bay Sands.",,
,,Tropical Paradise in the heart of Singapore,5,,"Visit this Tropical Paradise in the heart of Singapore, Whether you just walk the extensive footpaths through the garden, or go to one of the exhibits, or sky-walk, or a sound and light shoe in the evening. A great outing.",,
,,Perfect place for a stroll,5,,"This place is a big park/green area easy connected with the Marina Bay Sands. Walking around in the park to see the very divers green areas and flowers is free of charge while visiting the two inside areas (amazing design of the buildings) is well worth in order to see the amazingly rich displays of orchids and plants from all over the world. The place is beautiful equally at night as the lights and the shows every evening is an event in itself. Like everything in Singapore, the Gardens are very clean and the services around are just perfect. A cheap and at hand attraction, not to be missed.",,
,,Garden in the Big City,5,,"I never liked anything unreal until this garden. Now I started to change my mind. Even the waterfalls is not real, but it's waterfalls. And the other green thingy in the Garden is just amazing. I can't imagine people really make effort to take care of them all really well.
And now people have more reasons to go there, after Crazy Rich Asians. Hahaha",,
,,Must Visit,5,,Garden by the Bay stood up to the expectations. Beautiful place where you can spend a good amount of time. The gardens over there are spectacular. If you are going there pls take the lift and go to the top most level and keep walking down. At each level there are different attractions. The highlight is the light show which is at 8 pm approx. Must watch. Not to be missed,,
,,Must go for tourist in Singapore !!,4,,"here are 3 main attractions :
1. Flower Dome : You will get to see a lot flowers and plants in flower dome . If you have interest in Botany you can read out the description on plants. or If you are interested in photography you have good chance here to capture colorful flower setup. full visit might take around 2 hours.
2. Cloud Forest : A very big waterfall inside a very big glass room you can say. It's wonderful cloudy inside. usually very cold so wear a light jacket when you go in. it takes around 1-1.5 hour to see this dome.
3. OCBC Walk : A glass bridge connecting the super grove tress you can take 15 minutes walk on this .Preferred time in evening when Singapore downtown is lighten up. You get a very good view of Singapore skyline from OCBC skywalk bridge.
Around 7:30 pm /8:30 there will a light show which is free for everyone.

Ideal time to visit Garden around 2-3 PM first visit both domes and then explore the outside area. Kids love the play area I am pretty sure they are going to enjoy outside more than visiting those domes so you can plan accordingly.
Sometime Garden is closed for maintenance do check the date before buying your tickets.",,
,,Much better at night,5,,Went at night as part of a tout and by far Definitely better at night. All the trees are lit up in different colors and the views of Sands is absolutely outstanding. The is a walkway that youneed to buy tickets for that connexts the treea and give you a even better view. Definitely come here and see tgis at night time.,,
,,Gardens By the Bay,5,,"Attended with 4 friends. A hiccup getting there when the taxi driver dropped us at the wrong entrance. We were then advised the 鈥渁ctual鈥?Gardens were a 40 minute walk! Up for adventure (as always) we hopped on a bus for a few stops, found the train and eventually made it. Was it worth it? YES. a wonderful experience and the light show is not to be missed.",,
,,Nightly show!!,5,,Every night at 7:45 and 8:45 Gardens by the bay puts on a sound and light show in the giant trees. Beautiful lights illuminate these huge man made structures accompanied by show tunes. Guaranteed you will be humming and foot tapping your way way home.,,
,,One of the best and elegant,5,,Must watch .. don鈥檛 miss the skyway bridge and cloud forest . It鈥檚 has lots of rare plants . The sky way u can see marina bay sands clearly and good city view also Specially the shows at 8 and 9 pm,,
,,Well worth a visit,5,,"Amazing gardens with incredible design. IMy husband has no interest in gardens so he was surprised how much he enjoyed the visit. The water fall is so tall and walking up through it gives a great view.
You need a full half day to see the two main areas. Escalators and lifts makes it easy for those with mobility issues to get around. I would love to go back again as difficult to take everything in.So many plants laid out in an unusable design.",,
,,Fantastic place,5,,Visited the two main glass conservatory buildings and the park at nights for the light show. It was great. Give yourself at least 3 hours to visit.,,
,,Biggest indoor waterfall ever,4,,"Lots to see and enjoy without spending a cent, including 5he ground level of the metal trees (super tree grove) both by day and night and wander around the gardens hoping to see otters, bids and fish.

For those spending money there is a ticket to both the cloud forest with a waterfall and some very impressive mountain plants including orchids. The other site is the flower dome, and is far less interesting for most people.

The OCBC skyway walk is a loop and best taken by day and the nigh spectacular light show is best seen from the ground.

Eating is available a the satay by the bay, but this isn鈥檛 a normal hawker. Prices being higher and food being very limited, so best avoided. Also a pint of tiger beer is $11 which is very high for a hawker Centre site.",,
,,A cool way to spend the day! Literally,5,,Air conditioning! Spend your hot afternoon with a few hours viewing some beautiful gardens! The creativity is amazing.,,
,,Travels with my Aunt No. 3,5,,"If you don't visit these gardens and of a night watch the amazing Super Tree show, you have wasted your time coming to Singapore. Amazing!!!!",,
,,Stunning man made adventure,5,,Such an impressive feat for Singapore. Turning a swamp area into one of the most beautiful garden areas on the world. Well worth a few hours of your time exploring on foot.,,
,,classical concert with front row seats,5,,"What an amazing place to spend the evening-a light show and musical concert in one.Awesome experience,loved it.Would be the first thing I would return to in Singapore.Beautiful gardens,children play areas,sky walk at sunset and then these incredible man made trees literally singing...The best!",,
,,Go early in the morning and come back at night!,5,,"If you go early in the morning, between 7 and 8 AM, you will have the place to yourself! It makes the garden extra magical.

Come back at night to see the wonderful light show! Twice every night, 07:45pm and 08:45pm.

The garden is free of charge. When you want to visit the domes you need to buy a ticket. If you want to go on the bridge that connects the trees you also need to pay.",,
,,Good place to cool down,5,,This giant indoor greehouse is air conditioned. It has all sorts of plants from all types of climates and such a great variety. From flowers to cacti and succulents to pines. We went here after walking through the marina bay gardens.,,
,,Couple Visit,5,,"Good and awesome attraction place to visit for couple. Beautiful plants, flowers and scenery for pics!",,
,,Lovely,5,,Well worth a visit beautiful views over Singapore hard to believe it鈥檚 a big city with such lush green landscape.,,
,,"Beautiful exhibit, well worth a visit",5,,This place is very beautiful and well worth a visit if you are unlucky enough to find yourself in Singapore.,,
,,An afternoon of wonder,5,,The indoor exhibits are breathtaking as are the vertical gardens..try to time the skywalk for dusk so you get a decent view of the light show..around 8pm,,
,,Don鈥檛 miss this!,5,,"Well worth a visit, especially after dark when they have a magical light show. Very interesting gardens, with displays from around the world. Self sustaining and ecologically sensitive, even the light show; so it鈥檚 very special.",,
,,First time going gardens by the bay,5,,Is was a very enjoyable day with all the beautiful flowers. Lots of photo taking to take with family and friends.,,
,,Trip with my friends,5,,So wonderful and so great for the light and sound in the night time ... Travelling to there is very convenient.,,
,,Missing direction and information,3,,It was very enjoy full visit to garden but main problem we faced was improper direction and information board placed at site. Should management look to the subject. It will be a big help for tourists.,,
,,If you miss this.. then you are a fool,5,,"I鈥檓 going to review this from a typical mans point.
When I鈥檓 on holiday cultural places or places of 鈥渋nterest鈥?tend to fill me with dread, I鈥檓 happy sat in a street restaurant or bar to watch the world go by.
So trust me when I say, go to the gardens, you will love it, and it鈥檚 for everyone.

We purchased our tickets on line with a nice discount, all in we paid $SD-263, but this included Universal studios the following day, for three people, so roughly 拢56.00.

The email arrived promptly from a company called isango, and the tickets were to be collected from the main lobby in the Marina Sands Hotel (the huge one with the boat on top) at the super car experience desk, which is located inside the lobby area on the left.

Now the best time to go to the gardens is about 17:00, it鈥檚 a huge place with varying areas, now you can just walk round the place for free, but this will not allow you access to the 鈥渄omes鈥?or 鈥渟kywalk鈥?

The domes are fantastic, huge plants, sculptures and and array of little things that catch your eye, but for me, the added bonus is that both domes are cooled, so a pleasant time away from Singapore鈥檚 humidity.

The reason I say go at 17:00 is because at 19:45 the night light show starts that鈥檚 free, and it鈥檚 when all the 鈥渉uge fake trees鈥?light up to music, and in the center is a grassed are, go lay down there and look up.

Also there is a massive laser and light and music show on the other side of the Marina bay sands hotel on the water, if you follow the crowds after the gardens, you will catch the last 5 minutes, so if it鈥檚 your thing, head back there the following night for the 21:00 show. Which is also free.",,
,,A must see light show,5,,"This is truly amazing one of the best light shows I have evere seen. The music and lights work in perfect harmony and this is a site not to miss when visiting Singapore. Take something light to sit on like a plastic bag or piece of cloth as seating is very limited and due to the crowds one usually has to sit on the ground, so ladies dont wear white. Get there early and you might get a place to sit on the little marble walls around the garden.",,
,,Super trees! Dont miss them!,5,,"Go up to the super trees, its an amazing experience. Its like being inside a movie. Amazing views, amazing information, a pleasure to visit!",,
,,Good if you have interest in flowers,3,,Else you can skip it. I didn't find it interesting and felt bored. I don't have much interest in flowers. You may skip this actually.,,
,,Best Place to have a wonderful Afternoon and a luminous Evening.,5,,"Getting here is an easy job from City. Everything is systematic from ticketing to finding 鈥渨hat鈥檚 next鈥?. We visited Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. Flower dome is a place for Flower lovers.. Loved a stroll there. But the best thing is Cloud forest specially if you are during The misting time.. The chill , The falls , the garden and the arrangements are very surreal and enigmatic at same time. I loved visiting cloud forest. Evening is well spent in luminosity of the Golden and Silver Garden. They look beautiful with Lighting arrangements.. Must Visit.",,
,,Amazing,5,,"Been here both by day and night for the light show. Extremely impressed in both instances. The domes are super impressive by day and the light show at night. The gardens themselves are well worth the visit. It needs to have a day spent there to get the most out of it, then a little more at night. I most recommend the rainforest dome and the light show.",,
,,Aewsome,5,,"Worth a look. Beautiful and very creative gardens, sculptures and a beautiful way to experience a very unique garden. Loved it.",,
,,Great !!!,4,,Was really a really nice place filled with exotic flower and the view was amazing. enjoyed the aircon the most HAHA,,
,,Expansive flower/ garden display,4,,"i was awestruck at the spread of their display. though dint get chance to leisurely go through them all in detail, had good time.",,
,,Supertree Garden - Amazing,5,,The Supertree Garden is an amazing place by night. Make sure you don't miss the light show. People lay on the ground to look up and watch. The lights are synchronised to music. Very entertaining and very beautiful.,,
,,Nature at it's peak!,5,,Got our tickets at a local agent for very good deal. Visited both flower and forest dome. Amazing breathtaking view guaranteed. They also have light shows nearby which is free. A must to visit. Regret I went late should have went earlier.,,
,,Gardens by the bay,4,,Thoroughly enjoyed both the flower dome and the cloud dome. Spent a couple of hours walking through the cloud dome looking at all the plants and seeing how many we could name. Could get a bit busy and noisy at times. A bit disappointed when watching the video to see New Zealand wasn't on the world map.,,
,,Fantastic!!!,5,,This is for full family - both children and elders will enjoy. Must watch the sound and light show in the evening.,,
,,"Visited gardens by the bay, cloud forest and flowers dome.",5,,"I visited cloud forest and flowers dome regularly since its opening, I enjoyed every visit especially flowers dome, the management of the gardens by the bay always bring in different themes to enhance the flowers dome to draw more visitors, such as cherry blossoms, sunflowers, pumpkins display during halloween, tulips display. I always recommended my overseas friends to visit gardens by the bay and brought many of my friends there as well. This year I visited gardens by the bay 4 times already as i have a family pass.Outside the cloud forest and flowers dome is equally beautiful and it is free.I would like to recommend this is a must see attraction to all visitors to Singapore.",,
,,An amazing place that simply did not exist 10 years ago!,5,,"As long-time residents and citizens of Singapore, we have always enjoyed the outdoors and beautiful arrangements that our Government has built and developed. When the Gardens by the Bay first came up several years ago, we felt it could never really be a garden. Then in the course of the last 3 to 4 years Gardens by the Bay has transformed into an amazing garden, entertainment centre, indoor forest and themed glass-house that simulates all types of climates and allows us to enjoy the Sakura blossoms in Spring, the Sunflowers in Summer, Tulips, Dahlias and so much more.
This is definitely one of the must-visit destinations for any traveller to Singapore!",,
,,"Not only children but also elder people, can enjoy!",4,,"I was facinated in every areas. Especially I felt the artificial designs and stractures by trees and flowers were excellent. So, it was not boring for us to walk along many long pathes, rather than exciting. It seems to suggest what and how future gardens without preconceived ideas make us show.",,
,,Gardens by the bay,5,,The best garden I have ever seen! The cloud forest was so good. My daughter has the equatorial forest in her study curriculum and visiting the cool conservatory was like a practical lesson for her about the forest layers! It was an enjoyable experience plus a ecology lesson for most of us how to save our earth from the onslaught,,
,,Stunning,5,,A fantastic visit. We went early morning to explore the outside gardens before it got too warm. By lunchtime we were ready to go into the large domes. The first was plants from all over the world. Plus beautiful sculptures throughout. Very cool and comfortable throughout. They had a fantastic display of sunflowers but we鈥檙e changing it over to poinsettia鈥檚 for a Christmas display. We then went into the next dome. Again absolutely stunning. The sky walk above the trees and through the waterfalls were stunning. A really enjoyable day out. We went back again in the evening to watch the light and music performance on the super trees. Man made trees with plants growing all over them. Honestly what people think up and put into life amazes me. To see it for real is a definite must do while visiting Singapore,,
,,Fantastic,5,,Another sight to behold in Singapore. Beautiful gardens...it's like you are somewhere in the future. Loved it.,,
,,Gorgeous gardens.,5,,You shouldn't miss this if you in Singapore. Watch the Gardens by the bay light and dance show in the evening. Lovely.,,
,,Gardens by the bay-Flower dome,4,,"The environment is nice and there is a lot of sunflowers with different species. However, I went there during the end of the sunflower surprise event, some flowers were beginning to flag.",,
,,Light show at night was great!,5,,We visited the cloud dome close to closing time which was enjoyable as it was quiet and easier to navigate. We missed out on the flower dome but would have loved to have seen it if we had the time,,
,,Best indoor gardens!,5,,"Even from the outside the gardens look fantastic! Both halls are amazing, such a fantastic collection of special trees and plants. It鈥檚 definitely worth to visit the gardens during night time as well. Wonders light show",,
,,Not to be missed,5,,"I chose a hotel overlooking the river and the Gardens by the Bay and spent a day and a half totally immersed in the Flower Dome, Cloud Forest, and the entrancing sights along the Jubilee Walk and through the Marina Sands. It was exciting to hear so many languages and see so many families (Singapore is truly child-friendly).",,
,,Always beautiful and fascinating!,4,,Beautiful place for flowers viewing. Came here a few times to see the different display - from Christmas to Tulipmania to Sunflowers Surprise. There is always something new and different to see every time.The flowers display at flower dome is very beautiful but it is always crowded. Photo taking can be difficult as there are too many people around or wanting to take a photo of the same spot. It can take an hour to two to finish exploring the place at flower dome.Buy the entrance tickets to Flower dome and/or cloud forest online as it is cheaper and you do not have to queue to purchase it when you are there.,,
,,Awesome Tulip Mania!,5,,Truly mind blowing experience of the rich flora of the world maintained in the well air conditioned environment. You have to see it to believe it. Awesome experience! I am a tourist in my own country! :),,
,,Awe inspiring,5,,I went here to kill some time and was totally amazed by the scale and beauty of what they have done here at the Gardens by the Bay. I highly suggest this if you鈥檙e in Singapore and have a few hours. You will not be let down.,,
,,SUPERB!!,5,,We had limited time in Singapore but found time to see the Flower Dome which was magnificent. Very busy but we thoroughly enjoyed our visit and would recommend to anyone able to visit. The nursery rhyme themes are lovely and should delight both children and adults.,,
,,MUST -choose this on top anything else in Singapore,5,,"I'm not a garden fun but this UNESCO baby is absolutely amazing. Must be seen, Impressive in every little detail. Two gardens to see so the CLOUD FOREST is the one really worth, the 2nd one only if you have time. I was amazed by the beauty of the place which has 6 levels, all covered with plants, flowers, waterfall, and hidden sculptures.",,
,,spectacular must see,5,,Singapore is full of gardens but this take it to a new level. Electric trees and temperate forests and massive scale. A must see for Singapore,,
,,"Beautiful place, but I can't get the hype",4,,"This is a beautiful place, hands-down, but I don't see the unnecessary hype around it. To be fair, a walk through the Gardens is more often a relaxing enterprise.",,
,,Awesome!!!!!,4,,"I visited the place with my Mum, sisters and the kids.First time visiting the Cloud Forest. Truly enjoyed the waterfall....Enjoyed taking loads of photos that created so many memoriesA totally awesome package!!!!!",,
,,A wonderful parkland,5,,"A large expanse of greenery near to Marina Bay. Entrance is free to most parts, however charges apply for the domes and the skywalk.

Just wander around the area and take in the plant and treelife. There are also a few sculptures dotted around including a large baby resting on one hand. There are plenty of eating places and toilet facilities as well as gift shops. One slight negative for me is that signage could be better. Will review domes and supertree grove seperately.",,
,,"One of the must sees, if you're new to Singapore.",5,,"Beautiful gardens, and for the most part it's free. Don't miss the Super Trees. Tacky as it might sound the music/light show isn't to be missed!",,
,,Save our planet.,5,,A real eye opener when we look at the exhibitions regarding our planet and the damage we are doing to it.,,
,,Well engineered,5,,It like walking in your dream. Plants lovers will never see such a thing; plants haters will learn how to start loving plants.,,
,,A man made forest to showcase to the world,5,,"We had been told that we needed to visit Gardens by the Bay, it was absolutely worth it! How right were all the suggestions. It was wonderful to be able to stroll around, take in the sights and sounds, enjoy the experiences and just be.

Well worth the effort of visiting.",,
,,Amazing place to visit,4,,There is so much to see the sky bridge is amazing if you can stomach the heights. Well maintained. You do need to pay extra to visit some attractions but otherwise a great experience,,
,,Secret Singapore,5,,"I鈥檝e visited these magnificent gardens a number of times during the day, but my secret pleasure is to go first thing in the morning during the cool of the day. Admittedly the conservatories, restaurants etc aren鈥檛 open then, but you鈥檙e still able to walk around the hectares and hectares of garden. It鈥檚 quiet and peaceful and completely luxurious.",,
,,100% Stunning,5,,These gardens were on our must do list. They should be on yours. Such structural beauty combined with natural beauty of plants. Do the whole package.,,
,,Sunflower show,3,,Quite disappointed with the sunflower show. The flowers looked very tired and was expecting them to be a lot taller. Not sure it was worth the money. Signs around the park itself are very confusing to find places to eat.,,
,,Excellent,5,,The experience of the visit was excellent. Its a must visit for any person who is travelling to Singapore.,,
,,Awesome Gardens,5,,One of the best botanical gardens I have ever visited if not THEE best. Truly an awesome place! So worth it!,,
,,Light show worth seeing more than once,5,,"The music changes periodically and the it's all free, so it's worth checking out the evening light show every time you visit Singapore.",,
,,Free wonder tree show was a delight,5,,"Twice nightly, after dusk, the wonder trees have a 鈥渟on et lumi猫re鈥?event for about 15 mins. It鈥檚 a lovely delight and a nice way to end a trip to these delightful gardens.",,
,,Stunning,5,,"My first visit here, and I have to say, that it's stunning, just walking through the gardens and marvelling at the landscape, my only regret is, I never went at night, maybe next time ?",,
,,A morning in the Garden,4,,"Singapore鈥檚 Gardens by the Bay is a beautiful array of different types of flowers and carefully selected artwork to compliment the presentation designs.
The cloud dome was spectacular with a waterfall and crystal exhibit intertwined with the flowers and greenery. A presentation on global warming and environmental awareness gives the public a better idea of what is happening to the environment if we continue on our current path.The night light show was amazing, changing sequence with music.
The only downside was that the sky walk was closed for maintenance so we were unable to view platforms and those associated exhibits.
Definitely something to see on a visit to Singapore.",,
,,Incredible and free a must must see !!!!!!,5,,"This experience is an absolute must, the gardens and light show are free to enter and provide a fantastic experience for all. The light show is just the culmination of a great event, with live music, beautiful food and wonderful gardens to walk through. Possibly one of the best experiences I have had, and easily rivals a Disney light show. DO NOT MISS THIS, suitable for young and old. Just lay back on the grass and let the show begin.",,
,,Amazing to see the nature especially on ocasions,5,,It's one of the best attraction lately opened in singapore. It has many attarctions such: - Flower Dome - Cloud Forest - OCBC Skyway - Supertree Grove etc.... Admission for Two Conservatories 28 S$ Per Adult 15 S$ Per Child,,
,,Beautiful garden - a complete visual treat...,4,,"The garden is open to all visitors and aesthetically done with beautiful groves, a picturesque lake and vast expanse of greenery.I suggest visting the garden in the evening to enjoy the light and sound show.Reach well in time and occupy a comfortable place to gaze into the nightlit by beautiful trees and dancing lights....a complete visual treat and sould satisfying experience...",,
,,Singapore Garden Festival,5,,"Beautiful display of flowers. Interesting stalls and many varieties of plants and flowers on sale @ the various stalls. Bought a prize winning White orchid from a Taiwanese stallholder and am so impressed that the flowers can last for so long. So far, only 2 of the 12 flowers have died. And it鈥檚 already more than 2 months since I bought it in early Aug 2018. I also bought a self watering pot for my plants and I like it a lot cos I do not need to water my plants daily. I can go away on holiday w/o worrying about watering my plants. Cos it鈥檚 self watering",,
,,Beautiful Nature Park,5,,"The Gardens cover an area of over 100ha and are built on reclaimed land. The consist of the South, East and Central waterfront Gardens. In addition to the natural vegetation, we enjoyed the futuristic domes and supertrees, the sculptures among the trees and beside the waterways. Fantastic area to visit with the open garden areas fee free.",,
,,Just beautiful,5,,"Absolutely worth a visit, the gardens here and immaculate, so beautiful. Alot if people though, to be expected in a place like this. Dodging all the people and cameras can be a bit of a pain. But well worth a visit.",,
,,Awesome experience,5,,One of the beautiful place to visit in Singapore. How they have been created from scratch on the marina bay is really good to know.,,
,,Truly awesome,5,,"Fantastic place...worth visiting..
should devote atleast 5 hrs. ideal to come say around 3:00 pm and stay till the light & musical show under the canopies. Would suggest buying tickets online to avoid the lines.
Take a mat or bedsheet to watch the lights show - lie down and watch it - its best seen lying down...the domes are worth spending quality time - get a stroller if you have young kids - can be rented at the place (for $ 2).",,
,,Great for family outing,5,,"One of the latest attraction in Singapore. The garden by the bay comprises of 2 dome conservatories of different habitat, gardens with different themes and supertrees.

The dome will organise different flower exhibition every few months and carefully taken care. Entrance fee is reasonable.

The gardens are open to public and great for family with kids. Weekend are always crowded with family, locals and tourist.

The supertrees are another attractions open to public except the walkway with a small fee. There are lighting performance daily and definitely worth visiting at night.",,
,,"Beautiful, and nature conserving",5,,"We were very excited coming here, and we definitely should have been. The only part we haven't been to is the flower dome.",,
,,Beautiful spot for an evening stroll,5,,"We visited Gardens By the Bay in the evening when the neon tree show was on. It is absolutely spectacular to watch. Great activity for families, and with free entry for the grounds, a nice way to spend an evening without spending. After the light show, we visited Satay by the Bay which was a lovely open air food centre with great Satays. Highly recommend.",,
,,Worth a visit,5,,Nice garden by the bay. Worth a stroll. Visited the cloud forest dome which had beautiful plants. Would definitely recommend a visit.,,
,,Avatar Garden,5,,"Whenever I look at garden by the bay, especially at night, it鈥檚 just remind me of the movie avatar. They have a musical light show in the evening at around 9pm. It鈥檚 a wonderful sight.

Day time, family can go there for a walk. And children can have fun at the water park, where water splashes everywhere. They have a cafe beside the water park, so that parents can have a cup of coffee and watch over their children.

The gardens by the Bay have a theme and decoration for Mooncake Festival, Christmas and Chinese New Year. It鈥檚 a place recommended for all people to take pictures or just have a walk.

They also have many plants and flowers in the dome kept at a certain temperature to mimic the different Seasons for the flower to bloom. Great for flower lovers.

You need at least half of the day to cover the whole garden.",,
,,Most beautiful place on earth,5,,"The best time to go is evening 4 pm , for 2 hrs have a look at flower dome and cloud forest , 1 hr each. After that there is a light show for 1 hr . All three ( flower dome , Cloud forest, light show ) are extraordinary. Must visit place when visiting Singapore. It's easy access to city and very near to marina bay.",,
,,Amazing,5,,"This place is just magnificent, every nook and cranny is picturesque. If you can go at night to see the super trees light up.",,
,,Extraordinary world,5,,"It's perhaps the most talented project in Singapore. It brings us a feeling of a superreal world with giants which made from tiny factors. If you love trees and flowers, you must visit here.",,
,,Pleasantly Surprised How Good It Was,5,,Was not expecting the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome to be so interesting. I actually thought the orchid display in Cloud Forest was better than the Orchids at botanic gardens. Watched the night display near the main tree and this was a great location to enjoy the show. This is the type of place I would be keen to visit again.,,
,,Gardens by the Bay is a must-see destination in Singapore!,5,,Gardens by the Bay is incredible! The plants and flowers are the most extensive I have ever seen. Beautiful drift wood sculptures throughout. The indoor waterfall is stunning! The entire garden is beautifully designed and laid out! Enjoyed the 鈥淎loes in Wonderland鈥?exhibit and the current 鈥淲izard of Oz鈥?theme.,,
,,Stunning,5,,An absolute must when you visit Singapore. Absolutely beautiful - the Cloud Forest and Supertree Grove are superb. The light show at 7.45pm & 8.45 is excellent,,
,,Everything for the garden lover,5,,The Gardens by the Bay covers many acres with parklands and climate controlled greenhouse. You can walk around for free or get acces to the specialised domes by paying the entrance fee.,,
,,Phenomenal,5,,"This place is amazing. Be sure to get tickets for both the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. Both places are completely enclosed and cooled, so they provide and nice respite from the Singapore heat. Great views of the surrounding area, also from inside.",,
,,A beautiful way to spend an afternoon,5,,We had a lovely afternoon here not just because of the air conditioning but learning about plants and flowers I had not seen before. The Wizard of Oz sunflower display was just gorgeous and the cactii remarkable. Even if you鈥檙e not a gardener you will love the beauty that surrounds you in this place.,,
,,Outstanding,5,,"This has to be a highlight of any stay in Singapore. The gardens are stunning. The restaurants are expensive, however if you walk to the end and go to Satay by the bay, the food stalls there are good value.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"It is a beautiful garden with hundreds of flowers and trees. View from Sky walk was nice and highly recommend you to visit here around 4.30 to enjoy its beauty in daytime, sunset and nightime as well. Easy to reach by MRT (by taking MRT to Bayfront Station)",,
,,triple treat,5,,"when you visit gardens by the bay, you have to stretch your legs for warm up! alot of walking and strolling but it is all worth it. the views were all instagrammable! when we visit, we also went inside cloud forest and flower dome. All attractions were unforgettable and memorable experience!",,
,,Like Pandora,5,,"Beautiful orchids and flowering plants growing out of the Supertrees, recommend an evening stroll among the lit trees & pathways ... it looked like Pandora from Avatar.",,
,,Disappointing for Australians,3,,"I had read all the hype about the Flower Dome and the Cloud Dome so was really looking forward to them. I battled the crowds, lined up for a ticket, and lined up to enter the Flower Dome. The first section was an Australian garden. It looked like my own garden. Then there was daisies, azaleas, orchids, sunflowers .... all things that I see in my own garden, neighbours' gardens, Flower Power, Bunnings ... I can appreciate that other cultures and societies don't have such flowers - and I could see the joy that the flowers were bringing to the other visitors - but I was honestly disappointed. I then went to the Cloud Dome and walked in to see the artificial waterfall. It was well done and looked beautiful - but I've seen heaps of waterfalls in the national parks back home - in particular in the Blue Mountains. So I didn't even bother lining up to go to the top of the waterfall - instead I found the exit and left.",,
,,Excellent day out,5,,Spent a full day here lots to do and see most of it free but worth the price to go into the two glass domes to see what is in there.,,
,,A Must Go in Singapore,5,,"Never been happier when I went to places that have flowers and plants inside. The Flower Dome is amazing and beautiful. Great place to take pictures and bring kids to show them these beauties. The Cloud Forest is incredible, with its own indoor-waterfall and the fogs, also the high walk, you won't believe that you are inside a dome for a while. Will definitely come back when I am around.",,
,,Fantastic!!,5,,"We had been to Singapore in the past and had already toured the city extensively, so we were looking for something different to do. Someone suggested we visit the Gardens by the Bay as a wonderful and different place to spend the day. The Gardens are located on the bay that was created artificially and consist of two domes: one dome is dedicated to flowers, plants and trees that grow in hot, dry climates and the other, to vegetation that grow in cool, most climates. Both domes are large and artificially environment and temperature-controlled. Enormous thought was given to sustainability because in order to maintain the vegetation in both domes, air, light and moisture have to be monitored. The staff of the Gardens by the Bay must be aware at all times of the conditions of the flowers, trees and plants; the gardeners must trim, cut back, and constantly care for the health of everything that grows. Interspersed among the vegetation in both domes are statuary and works of art that add to your experience. In the cool-moist dome there is an artifically-made mountain made from live plants, complete with a waterfall that sprays mist beneath it. You can also begin at the top of the mountain and walk down, ending in a secret garden of small and exotic plants and flowers. You can explore the area outside the garden domes as well. There is a wonderful gift shop and several places to eat. We loved both of the gardens and only left reluctantly after a few hours. If you have at least half a day, do not miss these fabulous botanical domes. This is a great place to take children.",,
,,Indoor gardens - massive domes which are an engineering marvel,3,,They have grown all kinds of plants - saw the pitcher plant live first time. The walkways on the top and falls are awesome. 28 SGD per adult I thought is steep for that - hey but Singapore is an expensive city indeed. The outdoor park is also nice the lighting show is worth a visit - 7:45 PM and 8:45 PM shows,,
,,Wow,5,,One of Singapore greatest attraction. Do drop by here if you are in Singapore. Good job singapore.....,,
,,Amazing laser light shows!,5,,"This is one of the best attractions in Singapore. The location has options to spend time for the full day with multiple options on food, entertainment.
The light show is amazing, there were two different shows one at the park and other at the lake. The music and light both are aligned together which is a great experience!",,
,,Colourful place,4,,I visited this place in October and heard lots about his place. It's beautiful place visit but you need time if you are going to walk around if you really know you're flowers there is lots to see. It's very well organized place and great scenic views to take pictures. You can also see the waterfall garden. We bought tickets for both at the counter upon arrival.,,
,,Impressive gardens,5,,"Beautiful area , so a lot of things to see and do . Unfortunately we couldn鈥檛 do a lot of things in one time but def a must to visit",,
,,Astonishing,5,,The dome was great and not to be missed. Have to get tickets for the flower dome and sky wall. The indoor water fall and the walk was enjoyable. The various plant species were labelled and described. Very informative. There work is commendable. The evening lights were eye catching. Good facilities. Adequate facilities for the disabled. Good rest rooms and drinking water which is free. Requires 2 to 3 hrs time.,,
,,Worth a visit,5,,"The two domes were wonderful and good value for money. We ate at a cafe and had a good meal. There is just one smoking area in the gardens, by the river close to the central area where the domes are.",,
,,Amazing light show!,5,,This is a must when in Singapore - fabulous display and an incredible space designed by clever Singapore,,
,,A pleasant oasis,5,,"Of course walking in Singapore is hot and sticky, but a very gentle stroll through the Gardens was not too sticky. As with so much in Singapore it is very well planned and an enjoyable afternoon. Along with spectacular Cloud forest and Flower dome ( which are well worth the entrance fee and a must). The design of these greenhouses is stunning and the climate inside a very welcome relief from the heat outside. Do visit.",,
,,Superb,5,,Superb in night..unique experience..it takes about 3-4 hours to visit the entire place.. advisable to go in second half of the day,,
,,Better crowd management needed.,3,,"We visited the Gardens by the Bay in the evening in order to catch the much talked about Sound and light show at the Supertree Grove, which starts at 7 45 pm.

The show itself did not live up to the hype or our expectations. What's worse is that as the show ended, the crowds started to leave the area in a completely haphazard manner.

It was dark and there were no clear signages telling us which way to leave the complex. As a result, lots of people were queuing up and looking confused. There were no staff to guide us either, but we eventually managed to find our way by following the crowds to the Bayfront MRT station, which is almost a 20 minute walk away!

Overall not a pleasant experience, especially if you are planning to go with small kids. You don't want to get lost in a crowded place, in the dark!",,
,,Amazing place for kids to experience,5,,The gardens were spectacular. Everything about this attraction was awe inspiring. The kids enjoyed the LEGO displays and the crystals while us adults enjoyed the sheer size of it and the beautiful orchid displays,,
,,Not to be missed!!,5,,This is an amazing place to visit and I thoroughly recommend it. The evening light show is dramatic and colourful. The daytime attractions are unique. Easy access for wheelchairs and wide walkways.,,
,,Stunning light display,5,,Get there after dark and listen to music as the metal trees light up in the most fantastic display . It鈥檚 like fireworks without the bangs! We paid to go on the high walk which is worth it as you can get up close to the exotic plants climbing up the trees. Loved it so much we went back for a second night. Don鈥檛 miss this and it鈥檚 free!,,
,,MUST SEE IN SINGAPORE,5,,"This is one of those places you must see. Such a wonderfully laid out combination of gardens and displays. The flower dome and cloud forest are amazing and well worth the admission charge. Recommend two visits, one in daylight to take in all that is on offer, then back in the evening for one of the light shows in the super tree forest - complete with music, very spectacular. MRT Bayfront is a very handy rail link for the gardens. A great experience even if you are not a gardener.",,
,,A must visit on every trip to Singapore,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is famous for a good reason!

There is the awesome Cloud Nine, the rather unspectacular Botanical Garden, and then of course the Supertree Grove! The Supertree Grove is actually for free - only the walkway costs money.

Actually I think it is worth investing in the combination ticket for all three - and best time to go is in the early evening (golden hour) - for beautiful photos on the walkway!

And then of course there is the twice daily free lightshow in the evening! This is definitely not to miss! Check the times on the website - when we visited, it was 7:15pm and 8:15pm - you can also combine that with the water plays at the Marina if you are smart! :) For a evening, finish off with either visiting Singapore Flyer or by a drink at the Bar of Marina Bay Sands Hotel!",,
,,Truly beautiful,5,,"Take your time around this, make sure you get there early as it gets very busy around 6pm as people rush in to get a good view before the light show. It's so moving and there's plenty to see. Worth every penny! Only downside was the fact you feel rushed in parts to get into the next section so they can get a steady flow of tourists through. Would definitely go back!",,
,,Amazing place to visit,5,,Awesome place - would have loved to explore more at night if I had had the time. Lots of area to explore,,
,,fabulous night time colour,5,,"It was raining quite heavily and so the Ferris wheel was static, however the colour changing on the wheel was lovely. The gardens, themselves were lovely, but we didn't go inside. It was esay enough to walk to, if like us you enjoy walking (even in the rain).",,
,,A Spiritual experience,5,,Don't miss the cloud forest or the lightning show. Both are spiritual experiences. The cloud forest is amazing and just mesmerizes you with it's beauty and fauna. The lightning show takes you to a different world altogether,,
,,A day full of discovery.,5,,This is a must see in Singapore. Easy to get to on buses and trains. Beautiful gardens with something for everyone. The glass houses are magnificent and the full height waterfall and walkways very revealing. With a good selction of places to eat this is a full day out. We did not get to see everything so when visiting again we will make it a priority.,,
,,Just beautiful,5,,"We walked via Marina Bay Sands, and so found the sign posting a little confusing. In the end we headed for information and then found the ticketing. We also did a 20 train trip around the gardens which then made it much easier to get around. We were glad we visited the gardens during the day as after seeing the night time light show, I don鈥檛 think it would have been as impressive. If you don鈥檛 want to eat Asian food then apart from MacDonalds there is very little else. The Flower Dome and the cloud forest both a must. We didn鈥檛 have time to do the Skywalk, however when we return to Singapore it will be on our list. The night time laser show a very definite must!",,
,,Singapore tour 2018,5,,One of the attraction a must to vist we took the electric cart tour walk by the garden very close to marina bay,,
,,Wonderful park,5,,"Garden by the Bay is a huge park near Marina Bay Sands. If you don鈥檛 enter Flower Dome or Cloud Forest, it is free to walk inside. It is really big, and therefore there is also an electric car service. Anyway, this is one of the major attractions of Singapore.",,
,,Amazing!,5,,It was a beautiful place and was easy to find places. The waterfall was truly beautiful and even better at night,,
,,Highly recommended,5,,The most incredible place! A must do in singapore. Do the flower dome first and the cloud forest second.,,
,,Beautiful,4,,Gardens by the Bay is a must to see! So much beauty and you will really appreciate all the work they have done.,,
,,Well worth a visit,5,,"We arrived at 6pm, had a wander around the gardens which are free of charge. If you want to go into the Cloud or Flower dome there are extra charges. We did the sky walk for 8SD each, a must especially when the light show starts at 7.45pm",,
,,Go and see,5,,So happy I went to this exhibit. Only went into the two glass houses but very happy. 2 different displays but equally beautiful. The sunflowers were wonderful,,
,,Beautiful Scenary...,5,,"I love flowers, nature and any thing green. I was completely overwhelmed with the scale of the conservatories and the variety of plants from all over the world.",,
,,Superlative,5,,"What a testimonial model of Singaporean ingenuity,intelligence and appreciation of World of nature for all to see in a world ranking experience of our climate,fauna and flora WELL DONE SINGAPORE 馃憦",,
,,Fantastic must see activity,5,,Beautiful 鈥榮uper trees鈥?that are a must see for anyone traveling through Singapore. Definitely check out the light show too for a wonderful show at night.,,
,,Gardens of the Bay,4,,"Very nice. The buildings are as masterful in the design an construction as the plants an flowers inside are spectacular. The cloud dome is best during misting times, also impressive is the indoor 70 mindoor waterfall.",,
,,Amazing park !,5,,"The rain forest and flower park are amazing, the walk is very pleasant and a good guide to all the intricacies of such ecosystems. Well done !",,
,,Better than ever,5,,We loved our day at the gardens yesterday with our grandson. The flower dome was spectacular and fun with the sunflower exhibition and wizard of Oz theme. The rainforest was awesome. The ride around the Gardens afterwards completed a great day.,,
,,Beautiful,4,,"Is a great place where you can walk around and relax. Every evening there is music playing with stories, captivating people inside and make them sit to listen to stories. Everything is beautiful and great.",,
,,"OMG, the light show is AMAZING!!!",5,,"So worth a visit to this lovely garden. And at 7.45 at night, the trees come to life in lights, dancing to the music. Was very special :)",,
,,Amazing - A must see!,5,,This awe-inspiring tourist attraction is an absolute must see while in Singapore. You will not be disappointed! The gardens are truly amazing!!,,
,,It鈥檚 a must,5,,"Went on a quiet Monday morning,wandered around the high walk first with amazing views, then into the domes which were stunning,and walkways high up too , fabulous flowers and planting and loved the waterfall.walked back and through marina bay sands hotel to the shops and waterfront for lunch not far.",,
,,Very unique experience,5,,This was a wonderful visit with unbelievably beautiful flowers. I will go back if I get to visit Singapore again,,
,,Simply a must but I鈥檇 go at night,5,,"This place is breathtaking and is well worth a visit. Situated behind the Skypark and over the bridge, it may not be one of the wonders of the world, but its up there towards that list. We were late arriving and missed part of the show but at night, its simply breathtaking. The light show is accompanied by great quality sound and that audience simply become transfixed. It finishes around 9.00pm I believe but stays open for a stroll until around 2.00am. Dont miss it",,
,,A must see,5,,A beautiful way to spend a morning or afternoon. The gardens are amazing and so beautiful! Well worth the money to see all experiences!,,
,,Sight seeing,4,,If you a garden fan then this place is a must see. Flower dome is spectacular. My favourite was the succulent garden. It is nicely set out. Great restaurant inside called the Pollen to catch your breathe. Cloud dome for us was pretty much just wow for the waterfall.,,
,,Unexpected,5,,We went there without plan that night and we had a good time (event rain) but you will get another experience with a firework show (no cost),,
,,A must!,5,,"It鈥檚 really a must if you visit Singapore. Though it can be crowded in the afternoon and at night. There鈥檚 a sound and light show at 7pm. You can also see it from a far. The thing I like, you can find some water refilling stations.",,
,,Definitely worth a visit,5,,I can't recommend Gardens By The Bay. The Gardens by the Bay near the Marina Sands Hotel. Walking through these gardens makes you feel like you are on another planet. The gardens were artfully created and are meticulously maintained. Everyone must go and see this incredible marvel.,,
,,Incredible,5,,It was super good and gread time to spend there with friends... we visit the garden and it was super amazing!,,
,,Watched the GBTB light up in the evening,5,,"If you want to see the lights come on in the evening watch from the upper walkway of the hotel next to the park. It gets really busy, so go early. Worth it though.",,
,,Loved the Gardens by the Bay,5,,This is a lovely Garden during the day and at night too. The show at night is fantastic. Lovely place for a walk.,,
,,Architectural masterpiece,5,,It has to be seen and experienced.The garden of the bay.The over 10 hectares large space for this architectural masterepiece has been wrested from the sea.In the two huge glass houses is one of the largest attractions in singapore to see.The beauty of gardens with plants from all over the world.The Cloud Forest with the waterfall is also unique.We took one day to see it all. In the evening then an incredible farewell.The lights show is shown by the Supertree Grove.The whole with sounds of classical music.,,
,,Fabulous,5,,Setting is magnificent and the evening light show with songs from the musicals a must. Make sure you are in the super grove and not just the forest as we missed the first five minutes of the show !.,,
,,Loved it - stay for the night show,5,,"One of our highlights for of our trip, missed it last time we were in Singapore but it was on our bucket list Don't miss it and make sure you stay for the night show",,
,,Great Experience,5,,Very good experience here. Finale of the lights at 7.45 pm were fabulous. Recommend for anyone visiting singa pore,,
,,Man made wonder,5,,Very aesthetically laid out flora from around the world . The cloud forest is truly awesome . Worth a visit,,
,,Lovely,5,,The gardens the walk ways them amazing waterfall we鈥檙e really something to see to be honest even the architecture of the building . We did struggle to find the entrance but after that well worth the trip I would have like to see more of the attractions but ran out of time.,,
,,Amazing views.,5,,Quite simply the best thing we did in Singapore. My wife and I loved the cloud dome the most! We enjoyed the light show too which was kind of like a firework display and the flower dome was nice too.,,
,,Beautiful Flower,5,,It's great for family activity especially during the raining season. We love the plants and flower arrangement.,,
,,Cloud forest is breathtaking awesome ..Great experience .,5,,"Gardens by the bay has an entry fee of around 22-28 SD per head .It has two parts a flower dome and the cloud forest .The concept and creation of such a garden itself is amazing .There is huge area to walk around it takes more than 3 hours to view everything .Made a mistake of going there during the weekend its very crowded with photo -ops going on all over the place .The view from the overbridge is amazing where you get to see the Singapore eye and Marina bay sands hotel .The cloud forest was the best part with an amazing waterfall and beautiful colours with a variety of plants ,it can get very cold in there.The place is clean and well maintained with food joints and rest rooms available at regular intervals .",,
,,Awesome,5,,"This place was first mooted at a meeting in 2006, it opened in 2012! When the Singaporeans get an idea in their head, it doesn't take long to get it up and going. The diversity in these gardens are well worth the visit.",,
,,We visit it all the time,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is such a happy place that we keep visiting it again and again. We loved to visit it as a couple and now that our baby is nearly 2,he loves to run around and play. Good place to visit with friends and family.",,
,,go there for sunset,5,,when it is getting dark the illumination of the wondertrees starts and it is a great show and a wonderful atmosphere... really enjoying,,
,,Beautiful,4,,Fora and fauna are commendable... I hope i could visit again to see it during the night. Flower dome and Cloud forest requires entrance fee.,,
,,Magical place in one of the nicest cities in the world.,5,,"This was a great experience, not only for me, but also for my teenage daughter who is rarely astonished with anything, but this time she smiled all the way thru the visit. The evening show in the super trees really is magical and for the moment it feels like you are on some other planet. I would highly recommend the visit.",,
,,awesome garden,5,,"We were awed by the vast Flower dome and Cloud Forest. Both are indoor gardens full of super beautiful flowers, plants and trees. We took time in going around the garden and our pictures were very colorful. The highest point of the walkway in the Cloud Forest gives a nice overview of the place.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,I have guest in town and we had a splendid time in the garden. Lovely flowers and very well organised systematic garden.,,
,,Can鈥檛 beat the light show,5,,Still one of my favourite things to see in Singapore. The free light show is on 2 times every night and it鈥檚 so cool! Loved the theme. I wish we had great free things like this to see in my home town... will definitely be back again when we next visit,,
,,Evening visit,5,,"Came for the light show it was excellent if you're in Singapore it is a must top tip go early get you spot and stay a good 45 mins after the show as the crowds are treble to get out.
Make sure you visit the flower dome and the rain forest dome you can easily loose a day walking around lots to see. Staff at the information point very helpful and polite.",,
,,Awesome place,5,,You can't go to Singapore without visiting the Gardens by the Bay. The Super Tree Grove and both botanical gardens are a must see. Suggest getting to the Botanical Gardens right when they open to avoid the crowds. So worth it.,,
,,Good arrangement,5,,"All are good arrangement within the large area, but should be having persons inside the flower dome to explain about each area.!",,
,,I love this place so much!!! 鉂?5.0,,"I can't explain, how i love this place so much..

If you wanna go to Singapore, you must must visit Gardens by The Bay

Cloud Forest
Flower Dome
Supertree Groves",,,
,,"Superb, no other way to describe it",5,,"It was unbelievable. No picture does justice to the beauty of this place. Free entrance. You pay for Cloud Forest and the other dome. Definitely worth the price. Even as it is horrendously humid, you will enjoy this place. What they have done with vegetation, and technology is impressive. You can easily spend a whole day here and it is great for children of all ages.",,
,,"It is very beautiful, but...",4,,It is very pretty but it is very busy. It is more for families but adults might want to visit too. Visit once is OK.,,
,,Breathtakingly Beautiful,4,,"I don鈥檛 have any green thumbs, but this was a great experience. It鈥檚 a full day visit if you take in all of the property. The food outlets could be better, but you can bring your own picnic and have a very special, inexpensive day. The park is huge but the domed areas are the reason you go there.
We will head back there next time in Singapore!",,
,,Nice,4,,Gardens were wonderful and the light show was great. Not sure I would go again. Definitely recommended for every to see once.,,
,,Nice place,5,,Pls try to go in the evening when its dark to see full lighting effect. Usually time is 19:45 to 20:45,,
,,Good visit and I prefer the Flower Dome,5,,"Went with my family members here. Its my 2nd time here.
Bought both tickers to flower dome and the forest. Preferred flower dome because of the varieties to look at. Forest was not bad but sometimes the queue is quite bad. Flower Dome is more cooling though:)

This is a wheelchair/stroller friendly environment.",,
,,San Antonio Hiking Group,5,,Great place to learn much about plants and human interactions. What is happening to our earth. Half a day was not enough time to enjoy all that is offered. The price was extremely reasonable. Highly recommend a visit when you are in Singapore.,,
,,Loved it!,5,,It鈥檚 a must see if you鈥檙e in Sinapore. Don鈥檛 miss the evening light show! It鈥檚 free and it鈥檚 really worth it. It鈥檚 an amazing place! 鉂わ笍,,
,,Beautiful Place! One of the must visit places in Singapore,5,,"A whole day can be spent over here. The three main attractions are The cloud Forest, The Flower Dome and the Light show.",,
,,not your average garden,5,,"it's a man made garden. and as expected from singapore, everything is perfectly made. no flaws. we visited around 4 or 5 pm with the sun setting already. There was a part of the garden that was airconditioned and it has a restaurant in it that you can eat. it can also be a venue for a party or any celebration. kinda like what the crazy rich asians showed in the movie!",,
,,Spectacular experience,5,,"Absolutely loved both the domes. Gardens were amazing, flowers were beautiful, thoroughly enjoyed our day out.",,
,,Cloud forest too crowded,3,,We went at 530pm and the wait for the elevator up was so crowded that we had to wait 30 minutes. They should really install staircases.,,
,,Singapores Kew Garden,5,,"An absolute 'must see' when visiting Singapore, next to Marina Bay Sands hotel, will keep you occupied for entire morning/afternoon.",,
,,Cloud Forest and Flower Dome,4,,"Like going to another country with a different weather due to the air-con enclosure.The Cloud Forest is an eye opener and very educational about Global warming and Earth issues.Love the tall man made waterfall right after the entrance!Nothing much to see at Flower Dome though as its a much smaller area than Cloud Forest but the flowers will change every season so it will be worth a second visit for the flower enthusiasts.No time to visit the rest of the outdoor sightseeing spots cos we spent only half the day there.Worth to visit both the air-con sightseeing spot, a great getaway from the outside heat for chillax",,
,,Amazing,5,,Young or old.. expect to spend many hours here inside the domes (2). Great way also to escape the Singapore heat.,,
,,Local's point of view,4,,"Could have more shelter in event of wet weather, warning for tourists before they enter Cloud Forest as it might get a little chilly and perhaps some more interactive zones for the visitors!",,
,,Flower Dome,5,,"Made a trip to visit the sunflower display at the flower dome this October. As usual, almost my 5th visit to GBTB, it鈥檚 always very well maintained, clean and informative. A must visit when in SG. Appreciate the seasonal flower changes,",,
,,Fabulous,5,,What can I say. Gardens by the bay is fantastic. There is lots to see. The trees lit up at night are beautiful. There are lots of different gardens Japanese etc. Also places to eat.,,
,,Tourist Hotspot that even Locals Visit :),4,,"I went to the Sunflower Surprise 2018 last Sat. Good size crowd but definitely not too many people.However, the sunflower section was rather small and underwhelming. Most of the flowers were not in full bloom. I felt GBTB could have gone further into the Wizard if Oz theme, for e.g. I could see some of the Wizard of Oz characters, but the Wicked Witch of West could not be found. If GBTB have gone all out on the theme with more Sunflowers, it would have created a bigger Wow Factor.Nonetheless, I would go again if there are such interesting themes again. And I am a local. You know you tourist hotspot is successful when even your locals want to visit!",,
,,A delightful experience,5,,"It was beautiful, especially their cacti display as I really have a thing for cacti and succulents. The crowd was alright for a Saturday. Would go again. You won't regret it!",,
,,Photo Shoot at Cloud Forest,5,,My family of 6 people enjoyed the whole half day inside the Cloud Forest and taking photos shoot. Enjoyed the stunning view of the water fall at the entrance and there are so many different type of beautiful flowers everywhere to see and take pictures. Would recommend friends to visit Cloud Forest again.,,
,,Surprise sunshine,5,,"We really enjoyed ourselves at the garden by the Bay, it鈥檚 so beautiful, even the aritechtural are so well designed. We love the night lighting performance at the Super tree dome, just that the seats are all taken but we will be back again to visit and enjoy ourselves. I love shopping at the gift shops the gifts are nice n pretty.",,
,,4 STARS,4,,Great for family/friends outing. Many areas to explore. But cleanliness and eating place can be improved. Only saw 1 small Mcdonalds throughout my 4-hours journey.,,
,,Well worth a visit,5,,"Get the all included ticket, make time for a couple hours, have lunch and enjoy. Close to Marina Bay Sands, and its huge shops.",,
,,Fantastic Lighting Display,5,,"We went just before the first Light Show at 7.45 PM in Garden by the Bay. It lasted for about 15 minutes, it is really incredible, beautiful lighting display and we really enjoyed every moment. This is our second visit here and every time we watch it is mesmerizing. They have 2 shows every day and try to catch a good seat, so you need to be there at least 30 min prior to the show.",,
,,AMAZING,5,,This is an absolute must on any visit to Singapore. The Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome are amazing and can keep you fascinated for couple of hours. The super trees are a wonder and at 7.45 and 8.45 in the evening there is a light show which is enchanting.,,
,,Excellent Gardens,5,,"Great gardens and biodomes. Everything is superbly laid out and the biodomes well worth a visit. The walkways are quite wide so although there were lots of people around it didn't seem too crowded because there was enough space. I would certainly recommend a visit. The food areas were also well laid out - plenty of choice and plenty of seating, again there were lots of people but it didn't seem crowded and there were no queues anywhere.",,
,,Beautiful garden,5,,"Garden by Bay in Singapore is beautiful out of world excellent, one part is garden , this time theme was sunflowers so all around different types of sunflowers can be seen , also Orchids flowers , silver leaves plants and other varieties can be seen , must to visit for its location scenic beauty.",,
,,Fantastic place,5,,This is definitely a place to stimulate your senses and have you gazing in wonder at the fantastic gardens and amazing 'trees'. We visited both greenhouses and each contained impressive displays. The light and sound show each evening is worth stayin for.,,
,,Remarkable combination of nature and technology,5,,"This is the must do attraction in Singapore, and definitely worth doing twice - once in the day to enjoy the greenery, plants, two enormous glass houses; and again in the evening to watch the light show. Extremely Impressive",,
,,Amazing place,5,,"So beautiful, light show is great as well, sure worth waiting. Go to the flower and rain domes! There is entrance fee, but they are really good and should be included in the visit.",,
,,Excellent,5,,"Only had 5 hrs here, needed much more time. Well worth the visit. Visited during the day better if done over night as well.",,
,,Magic place,4,,"I had my doubts but it really was worthwhile... domes and the show....yes a bit busy and hot ..... but, A MUST IN SINGAPORE",,
,,Just Go,5,,"This place is brilliant, a must see when in Singapore either day or night entry is free but there are some venues that you will have to pay a entry fee.
But if you dont mind walking then just take your time and enjoy the gardens which are open and lit up at night",,
,,Marvellous place,5,,"This place has lots to offer, walks, art, lakes, a lot of it is free too. I highly recommend this place, if you are going to visit the two domes (cloud garden/flower dome $28) and look around other parts of the garden I'd allow two days. Come back for the amazing light show at 8pm too.",,
,,"Fabulous Gardens, Domes, trees and Lake",4,,Beautiful gardens the Cloud Dome and the Fire Dome are special as is the skywalk and the walk by the lake,,
,,must go in Singapore,5,,"quite a big garden, easily accessible from the Bay Sands shoppes. got two large areas where u can see different species of plants, air conditioned! missed the ocbc skywalk as it was closed due to heavy rain. light shows at night",,
,,Great location. Interesting space.,5,,Much enjoyed the visit. It鈥檚 a great spot and the biodomes are good option on a rainy day. Combine it with the light show in the park and you are laughing,,
,,Wow wow Wow,5,,What a fabulous creation! Beautiful gardens and park area. Well setup and accommodates those with walking difficulty. Just a little chilly inside.,,
,,OMG Spectacular,5,,Gardens by the Bay are the most beautiful gardens I have ever seen. Thousands of different species of flowers and trees in a spectacular settings. We spent hours wandering through. I would highly recommend for anyone especially the keen gardener.,,
,,Amazing and well worth a visit,5,,The Gardens by the Bay is a great attraction and really worth going to see. There have a fantastic array of plants and they are very well set out. We went at night and the place is just magical the atmosphere is wonderful highly recommend.,,
,,Amazing displays,4,,Both domes are an amazing feat of gardening. The current display was the wizard of Oz. Hundreds of sunflower species were used. The different types of climates were displayed with amazing flora and fauna. The cloud forest was spectacular. Did not stay for the light show.,,
,,memorable and fascinating,5,,"We were there for the mid-autumn light up and the illumination+music is fascinating. Accessible by public transports - buses and trains. Walking distance from Marina Bay Sands. Lots of amenities...benches to rest our legs; cafes, restaurants, food courts, plus we do not have to walk the whole garden to look for toilets... that is a great convenience for kids and seniors",,
,,Honeymoon,5,,"Fantastic a must to visit, absolutely amazing gardens and lighting. The flower and cloud gardens have such an array of different plants from around the world.",,
,,A must see whilst in Singapore,5,,"WOW - this is a amazing garden complex.
The evening light shows to music are fantastic. Every type of plant you can imagine from all over the globe.
To top the night off they have a satay area where you can enjoy great food and drink outdoors and undercover.
Get a spot for the light show early or you will have to stand. It鈥檚 awesome",,
,,Totally mind blowing,5,,Just incredible plantations and displays of flowers. We loved every moment of our visit here and spent over 4 hours wandering through the parks and domes.,,
,,Highlight of Singapore,4,,Gardens by the Bay is the highlight of Singapore. Truly amazing and not to be missed. Our family went to Cloud Forrest and Flower Dome and then watched the Super Tree Grove night show which was spectacular. Not many good food options in area though,,
,,Not to be missed,4,,Beautiful gardens and amazing Cloud Forest exhibit where you can experience walking through tropical forests while admiring the skyline of Singapore. Great exhibit on climate change and its impact. Do not miss the sound and light show at the supertree grove. Best way to end your visit at the gardens by the bay!,,
,,Awesome,5,,Beautiful spot to chill with whoever. Instagram worthy shots. Free entry but need to pay for certain places. Able to conveniently get there by BAYFRONT MRT (CCL/DTL). It's a 10 out of 10 for me. It's great!,,
,,Extra-beautifully bucket-list worthy!,5,,"It鈥檚 amusing to visit Gardens by the Bay Flower Dome and Cloud Forest with a new crowd, because you get to experience their flabbergasted feelings together. Needless to say, my Irish relatives were blissful to see these award-winning themed conservatories; not only were they glad to have seen the African-themed dome, but they were also fascinated to see the exceptional display of plant life. Equally, even after visiting this place for X number of times already, I can鈥檛 help but be marvelled by how Singapore can change the theme of the conservatory, and make it look diversely vivid compared to the previous one. This one sunny revisit to these coolest domes in Singapore is truly a must do at all times.",,
,,Fantastic area with the expansive Gardens.,5,,You can access the Gardens By the Bay by taking the MRT to Promanade MRT station. It is a short walk to the Singapore Flyer and then on to the Gardens. The Marina Bay Sands Complex is also close by. Make sure you do the elevated walk amongst the big tress for about $8. The Pavillions are absolutely fantastic and not to be missed. Return just before dusk at night to see the Sound and Light show. The Singapore Flyer is about $24 but is worth the money.,,
,,Great attraction,5,,A unique place to go with beautiful gardens. Walkways that test your fear of heights and fabulous photo opportunities day and night.,,
,,Fantastic,5,,"A beautiful experience, well done Singapore, you should be very proud of your creation. They are just the very best gardens we have ever seen.",,
,,Magical,5,,By day it is beautiful. My night magical. I went during the garden festival and it was a mass if flowers,,
,,Wonderful,5,,I enjoy gardens and try and visit as many as I can on my travels. These gardens are interesting and a bit futuristic. A must see for those that enjoy gardens. I also visited the cloud forest and flower domes which are worth the entry fees.,,
,,A nice trip,4,,"Spent the afternoon wandering around and walked on the walkway above the park which was really fun
Returned at night to see the light show with music
Why other cities can鈥檛 provide such free light shows is difficult to fathom
The exhausts which light up are just magical
A definite to see and the show is on twice every night
Just follow the crowds",,
,,Breathtaking Beauty,5,,We were delighted by the original and beautiful sights of the Garden. Our first visit and would highly recommend a visit to enhance your stay in Singapore.,,
,,Memorable experience!,5,,What a stunning architectural undertaking. These gardens were beautiful. Fascinating and very enjoyable. Beautiful attraction,,
,,Fabulous,5,,Fabulous time we had looking around these beautiful gardens well worth the entrance cost. allow a few hours to walk round the different zones,,
,,"great hardware, bad software",1,,"the service staff return the ticket so close to my mum's chest, his hands nearly touch her chest. staff while taking photo for us then asks if we know the background flower was fake. felt like he is laughing at us for taking a pic with a fake flower.",,
,,Absolutely superb,5,,"Not only is this an architecturally superb building, inside its breath taking. Amazing plants, waterfalls & displays. An absolute must if you鈥檙e visiting Singapore.",,
,,Great gardens,5,,"Well worth a visit, great open air park which is free, only pay to get into cloud areas but with the cost.",,
,,Afternoon and Evening Visit,5,,"We timed our visit so that we saw the outside areas in the daylight and were still there for the night as well, so if you go just before dusk this means you get to experience both times. We didn't go into any of the paid areas but did enjoy the gardens outside. Amazing structures and we all took lots of photos. Great place to get photos of the Marina Bay Sands as well.",,
,,A picture is worth 1000 words.,5,,Night time / sunset is an amazing time to stroll around the gardens. And if you鈥檙e lucky you can take amazing photos of the scenes here. Shot with DJI Mavic 2 Zoom. Marina Barrage is the spot to fly (today) legally so if you fly drones make sure to be aware of the spot to fly from.,,
,,Cool respite from the heat,5,,"Awesome gardens, fantastic air conditioning. Very well thought out. Just stunning. The garden planners are very clever.",,
,,Perfect blend between nature and futuristic buildings,5,,One of the highlights of Singapore. This place is especially impressive at dusk when everything gets illuminated.,,
,,Visit to Gardens by the Bay,5,,As a group we visited gardens by the bay and found it delightful. Both of the domes where amazing and the standard of displays was wonderful. We stayed on for the evening light show and again found it to be fantastic. I would recommend both the domes and the light show to anyone visiting Singapore.,,
,,Beautiful place,5,,"A fantastic visit here so tranquil in such a busy city. The domes are amazing the flowers and plants a real celebration of flowers from around the world the second dome with the forest an waterfall is breath taking.

You could spend hours walking around all the gardens outside and a must do is the bridges that link the iconic structures within the garden and light up a night.

Such a peaceful retreat away from the city hustle and traffic and one to definitely have on your list. Would recommend pre buying tickets for ease.",,
,,Head inland,5,,"Gardens By the Bay are one of the most beautiful and well tended to of all I have ever seen. Most people, however only visit the most popular locations, which are located near the coast. If you have time, head inland, not only will you discover more, but you will do so in tranquility of near-solitude, away from the crowds.",,
,,One of the most amazing places experienced,5,,"Singapore is an absolute amazing vibrant city. This place is so fascinating, stimulating and a fest for your eyes! It's so beautiful! Definitely: it's a must to experience: to see, to touch, toe ear, to smell, to live! A.",,
,,Gorgeous gardens!,5,,My daughter and we鈥檙e lucky enough to visit the gardens. We chose to go just before dusk so we could partially view in daylight but also be there when the beautiful lights lit up in the domes. The displays were absolutely amazing and the attention to detail with the beautiful wood carvings throughout the gardens made it all the more enjoyable...one of the must-sees in Singapore,,
,,Exotic,5,,Exotic flora with an awesome architectural touch. Truly unlike anything else. Yes there is a lot of rush and you have to wait a lot. But at the end really worth it.,,
,,NO NEED TO PAY. Just go for the music&light show at night,4,,"I bought the combined ticket for both cloud forest and flower dome and I was super disappointed. Yes, you can see many types of plants and trees but the whole place is designed in a phony way. There is what it looks to be Heidy in front of her house and some dwarfs. There's a huge plastic sunflower balloon and other decorative elements that makes the hole place look unnatural. The beautiful waterfall you see in pics doesn't represent the real which looks more like a huge parking lot (without cars and instead corridors for people to walk by) decorated with flowers and water running.
Maybe it's interesting for kids and people who want to take pics next to a fake volcano or sculptures of people representing the visitors of Singapore airport (?!?!?). But for those who are expecting something more like a green house and the feeling of nature, this is not the place.
Better to just visit the gardens outside and see the AWESOME SHOW they have at 7.45 and 8.45 and totally for free.",,
,,Great exhibition,4,,Sunflower exhibition was pretty good and interesting. Always nice to have a change of scene every once in a while.,,
,,Absolutely amazing,5,,Spent an afternoon here and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The descriptions of the exhibits are clear and very good and the way the place is planned adds to the enjoyment.,,
,,Amazing Garden Complex,5,,We enjoyed several hours walking around these amazing gardens - they are truly unique. We were able to sit and enjoy refreshments and keep our fluid levels topped up on what was a humid day as we browsed the Chinese Gardens and the Cacti Garden and the Sky Tree garden.,,
,,Highly recommend a visit to the cloud forest,5,,"Visited the cloud forest as part of a visit to the gardens by the bay. We purchased a combined ticket for both cloud forest and flower dome, of which the cloud forest is far superior. Try to time your visit just before misting begins as this adds a surreal edge to the visit.",,
,,Awesome,5,,"This is a must ,i had been dying to see this and it did not disappoint, be aware that if it rains you can't walk among the sky trees and its best to go mid afternoon, to see both domes and gardens then the lazer show once dark",,
,,Well worth a visit,5,,Very modern and spectacular garden attraction. We spent around 4 hours visiting and could easily have added another 2 or 3 . There is plenty to see the gardens are well laid out in different climate zones. A fairly relaxed atmosphere be prepared to circumnavigate the many selfie obsessed locals. Overall a good place to visit.,,
,,Singapore evening tour,5,,"The light show at Gardens by the Bay was included in the tour, just spectacular, don't miss it. The music and lights are just beautiful",,
,,Good and relaxing,4,,It鈥檚 one of the great to be here at Garden by the bay. The light show in the garden starts at 7:40 & 8:40 PM. Please check in by 7:00 pm so that I can take a good seat reserved for it or you can take OCBC walk with is around the giant trees (cost 8 SGD),,
,,Gardens by the bay,4,,Really great environment to spend a relaxing stroll through the gardens. Fantastic atriums so we鈥檒l laid out. Worth the visit,,
,,Gardens by the Bay,4,,"Well worth a visit, however was found to be extremely crowded with the majority of people more interested in taking photos of themselves than looking at the plants.",,
,,Great Light Show!,4,,"Perhaps to step up the light show, it would be awsome if colorful lasers were used from structure to structure. Easy to get to by MRT. A must visit for tourists with shows at 7:45 and 8:45 pm.",,
,,Most Impressive gardens.,5,,We took a tram ride around the park in order to get an overview. There is so much to see that we will have to return next year!,,
,,Amazing,5,,"Amazing place, the Cloud garden is one of the most enjoyable and amazing thing I ever seen. Must to visit!",,
,,amazing at night,5,,"We took the MRT in the late evening and had a walk around the gardens. One of the most amazing display of lights I've ever seen. We also went up to the roof top bar, cost was $20 and you got a free drink just don't buy another one! A vodka and coke was $18. Well worth the view though and the evening light and sound show was a must see !",,
,,Family,5,,Best free show in the world ! Super tree show at 7:45 pm and 8:45 pm fantastic! Flower dome had sunflower Wizard of Oz theme ! So beautiful 馃挄,,
,,Spectacular sights,5,,The gardener provide for a peaceful walk and spectacular sights. There are loads of cafes and the gardens are well signposted. There is wifi throughout so you can share your experience with your friends back home.,,
,,"I鈥檓 no gardener, but this is fantastic",5,,"Great way to spend 3 or 4 hours. The external parts are free and worth a look, but the Cloud Walk area is worth every cent of the entrance fee. I will definitely head back with my family next time we are in Singapore.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"The most amazing gardens, they have thought of everything within the areas. The plant life was truly beautiful and so easy to walk around even on a hot day. Would highly recommend!",,
,,Spectacular view,5,,Take MRT to Bayfront station and be there before 19:45 to see the light show. The best spot to see and take a nice photos is the glass bridge that connected Gardens by the Bay to the shoppe @ Marina Bay sand,,
,,Gardens by the Bay is a must visit in any trip to Singapore,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is definitely one place which must be on your itinery in Singapore. The flowers and fauna are all so beautifully laid out. Children also love the place and they also learn from the visit. There is a lot of walking to do, so wear comfortable clothes. Water is available in convenient locations to refill your bottles.",,
,,Amazing place; must revisit,5,,"I have been here a couple of time through 2018 and each time I find is an amazing place to visit. Great for families, couples, business visits and singles.",,
,,Well worth a visit,5,,Was on our must do list for our visit and did not disappoint Weather was showery in the day we visited but as was inside it didn鈥檛 matter We thoroughly enjoyed the visit well worth it,,
,,Worth a visit,5,,"We visited the gardens after going to MBS, was definitely worth a look. The super trees were amazing and the skywalk is worth the effort. Take your time and plan to spend 1/2 a day here. Didn鈥檛 go at night this time but will definitely do that next visit.",,
,,Spectacular,5,,"Visited in the day and the evening. We went to the 7;45pm light show, which was played out to songs from the musicals. It was awesome. The whole Marina Bay area is just fantastic but best at night. A shoppers delight if so inclined",,
,,Fantastic,5,,"Cloud forrest dome and flower dome were very futuristic and unbelievable. Cloud forrest almost reminded me of 鈥渁vatar鈥?movie.

Super tree groove is a great place to visit. Don鈥檛 miss the 鈥淕arden Rhapsody鈥?show in the evening. Lights, music,architecture and landscape makes it an unforgettable experience.

Overall, time well spent and memorable.",,
,,Absolutely stunning,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is one of the most beautiful attractions that i have ever been to. I cannot recommend going here highly enough. The waterfall in one of the domes is amazing and i didnt realise that there is so many different orchards.
The night show with the lights and music is awesome.
There is different places to eat and a gift shop.",,
,,Go twice - day and night,5,,"A must see in Singapore, both at day and night! Gardens by the bay is extremely unique way to represent nature with a modern flare. During the day you can explore both the outdoor and indoors gardens and indoor cloud forest. The light show at night is really special. They have 2 shows a night. There is a lot of walking so bring good shoes and of course a camera!",,
,,Night time treat,4,,"Whilst you may have experienced the Gardens By The Bay during the day, treat yourself to a leisurely stroll around the Gardens after dark to see the night time displays. I was lucky enough to see the Autumn Festival displays, and I wasn't disappointed. Don't forget to take your camera for the odd photo / selfie.

Well worth a that second (night time) stroll if you ask me.",,
,,It's like a fairy tale land. Don't miss the Super-tree grove light show!,5,,"The Gardens by the Bay are just something that one should not miss if you're ever there in Singapore. A lot of places in the gardens are accessible for free. However, the two main domes: The cloud dome and the flower dome require a ticket. The OCBC skyway also requires a separate ticket per person.

The supertree grove is free and so is the sound and light show which is one of the most magical things I've seen. I was so overwhelmed that I had tears in my eyes.
Tip: find a place to lie down and watch the show. It's like watching stars dancing.

We used the Klook app for our ticket purchases for the two domes (NOT the skyway).

The waterfall in the Cloud Dome was heavenly It was really cold in the Cloud Dome. So much so that we had to wear our jackets. The flower dome was very pretty.",,
,,Brilliant Day or Night!,5,,Went to the gardens by the bay twice and they are astounding. The domes are great with lots of beautiful plants and epic surroundings. Went at night to see the light show which was also amazing and displayed the greatness of this park. Domes are very busy in the afternoon and you can often wait in a queue.,,
,,A must see,5,,"This place is just amazing , an area of the entire garden for everyone .

So much to see and do, kids and all.

It is a must see and do, don鈥檛 rush through allow a full Day to explore the gardens either by walking or tour . I would recommend and afternoon start, stop for lunch and then stay for the amazing light show early evening.

If you have kids , there is a water park to entertain them and cool off in the hot weather.

The light show is nothing short of amazing and beautiful. You can鈥檛 visit Singapore without going to gardens by the bay .",,
,,A must see,4,,"This place is like something out of a science fiction movie, a beautiful blend of natural and man-made.",,
,,Unique green hub in the midst of skyscrapers,5,,"Beautiful place.. lot's to do without even buying any ticket.. Can comfortably spend half a day here.. Must do when in SG - preferably time it in 2nd half, so that you get to see the lit up structures..",,
,,Beautiful relaxing self guided tour - great photo op,5,,My husband and I are avid gardeners and appreciate the beautiful landscape and clever design for this attraction. The access was wheelchair and elderly friendly. It was a cool break from the heat outside. Just amazing beauty everywhere you look. A photo opportunity at every turn and even if you are afraid of heights like I am I still felt safe and could stand at the edge for selfies. There is a fair bit of walking and can get a bit crowded for photos but this is a must see for children and nature lovers. I would definitely go back again if given the chance.,,
,,Breathtaking View!,4,,"If you're a flower lover then this is definitely a place for you. This place is surrounded by flora and faunas of different kinds. I really love the cloud forest, the indoor waterfall is just beautiful, especially at night when it lights up. As soon as i entered the done I was in awe.

I also went into the flower done and during my visit there the theme was Wizards of Oz. There was a castle from the movie which was cool, a wizard figure and also Dorothy's house with Dorothy standing outside. Not forgetting the amount of sunflowers surrounding the place. It brightened up the whole place, just beautiful!

My last stop was the supertree groves, my actual reason of visit. I made it just in time for the light shows. It was freakin amazing!!! Everyone was just sitting on the ground and watching the show, the music the lights was just on point, it was beautifully played. Definitely coming back there next time!",,
,,nothing much to do,2,,It was a disappointment . nothing much to do. minimal flowering and no info on display to know about flowers and plants. People on duty also have no info. Training them with info on the plants might do some good. Miracle garden in Dubai is far better and id much more value for money,,
,,Garden by the bay,3,,"A spacious outdoor environment suitable for family bonding Good for morning and evening exercise However, need to pay extra to see the indoor waterfall and flower exhibitions",,
,,Nice place and above all-great project,3,,The architecture is interesting and the variety of plants quite surprising; thoughthe films and explsnations about the whole project and its planning are what we most liked; very instructive and eye opening also for teens; 1 max 2 hours are sufficient ; the castel and other decoration items do not quite fit though,,
,,Breathtaking,5,,"This was probably my favourite attraction in Singapore. The Supertree Grove looks absolutely incredible! We came once in the daytime (on a Thursday morning/afternoon and it was virtually empty) and then came again another day for the evening/night time light show.

When we came for the light show, it was a Saturday evening, and I'd recommend getting there a bit earlier because it was packed with tourists and the queue was super long for the Skyway. Definitely would recommend getting tickets for the Skyway - only $8SGD and offers a different view of the Supertrees. We were given a time slot to queue for it though as it was so hectic and busy.

The light show, although only 15 minutes, was so pretty. I feel like I'd never get bored of this view!",,
,,Singapore with my friends 鉂わ笍,5,,We are really enjoyed ! highly recommended to visit this place when you come Singapore .Such a nice view and nature environment,,
,,Simply Stunning,5,,We visited here with the Sunflower exhibition. This place is certainly amazing. It is great to visit if it is raining as it is all indoors.,,
,,A wonderful experience,5,,"Great for all ages, a truely beautiful sight and so much to see. Easy to get to via the local Metro Route.",,
,,a must go place in SG,5,,Gardens by the bay is a nice place to visit!my first time there & i like the atmosphere.I will visit that place again!!,,
,,Garden Rhapsody show is a must!,4,,"Went there at around 6pm and there was still a long queue for tickets, bought mine online and went straight in by just flashing the barcode on my phone. It was getting dark so pictures didn't come out as nice but it was interesting to see the transition from day to night. Loved the cloud forest and the waterfall. Flower dome not so much, only thing for us was the sunflower display which was really beautiful and made our day. Walked over to the supertrees for the garden rhapsody show (free of charge) which was amazing! Just pick a spot, lie on the floor and enjoy!",,
,,The best place in Singapore,5,,"There are three main things,1. Super trees - Light Show2. Cloud forest 3. Flower domeThese places amazing and visitor friendly. light show was really good. that we didn't expect. we went two days to cover every thing. otherwise you may tired. Thanks",,
,,Nice to visit during night,5,,"It's a great place for hanging out with friends especially during night. After dinner, can walk around and enjoy the music light show around super tree area. Kids can play on the grass and also good to have a picnic there. Very nice place!",,
,,Wonderful by day and night,5,,This is an aspect of Singapore that should not be missed. An iconic area that has beautiful aspects no matter if it is viewed by day or night. Can be a significant walk with a limited shuttle options.,,
,,Lived up to all expectations,5,,"Having heard so much about Gardens by the Bay it was one of the first things we did in Singapore. We visited the 2 domes and were amazed by the designs and the lush foliage. Every we turned there was something new and exciting to see. Plenty of seating and clean toilets.
We then took the audio tour all around the gardens which gave us a chance to see so much we could never have covered walking. And there were taxis waiting when it was time to leave
A wonderful day.",,
,,If you are going late - Skip it.,3,,"The gardens look much more attractive in photos. But when you go visit, they are relatively small and you don鈥檛 get the wow factor in the outside grove..

We went late so tickets were closed for cloud forest and flower dome so we had to visit the outside garden. Also saw the light show.

Overall Recommend to Skip if you have missed the time to see cloud forest and flower dome.",,
,,Singapore in a nutshell - loved it,4,,"Loved the Gardens at the Bay - it emphasised how Singapore truly cares about the environment and this is apparent from the gardens, flower dome and cloud forest. I went during the rainy season so it wasn't terribly busy which was so nice! The cloud forest was a real highlight!",,
,,Awesome Flower Garden Dome!,5,,"We visited Gardens by the Bay's Flower Garden dome on Monday September 24th evening. The theme at the time was ""Wizard of Oz"". Many of the display there include characters from the show, to add to the regular art sculpture. Another focus was on sunflowers, so there were many types of sunflower on display with different shapes, sizes and colors, and they were all so beautifully arranged. The environment under the dome is really nice, with climate control that makes it enjoyable to go around and explore, and there's so many interesting vegetation and flowers to see. There were several section, each with specific vegetation from particular areas: Australia, Middle East, South America and Asia to name a few. Highly recommended to visit if you like to see interesting flowers and vegetation from all over the world in one place.",,
,,Loved Gardens by the Bay,5,,"My wife and I visited Singapore in September (2018). We stayed in Marina Bay Sands, so went to the gardens a 3-4 times during our stay. It is such a great place to visit. It is a really nice, relaxing place to walk around. The Supergrove trees are spectacular; particularly at night for the light show. The glasshouses (cloud forest and flower dome) were well worth a visit. I particularly liked cloud forest. A must see whilst in Singapore.",,
,,Must See,5,,You will be transported in another world when getting in. Each month they have a special theme. I've seen the Sunflower garden with Dorothy and the Magician Oz. They have created several countries/ continent garden/ endemic plant. It was as if i did a world tour within a few steps. Definitely worth it.,,
,,A plant-lovers' paradise,5,,"We came to this area in the early afternoon, having just flown in and dumped our luggage at the hotel. The size of the place is amazing, of course, accommodating full-sized trees. One wonderful surprise was that it was actually more comfortable (ie: cooler and less humid) than it was outdoors. There are multiple different environments represented so every horticulturalist will find something (s)he likes. I noticed that a couple of cacti appeared to be mislabeled, but that did not detract from the visit. We did not realize at the time that this would be all lit up at night, but so we discovered a couple of days later while walking through the same park in the evening. Lots of families with strollers, grandparents, and tourists like us. We could see that there was a constant upkeep process, so I am guessing this is a good place to go regardless of the season.",,
,,Great Light-Show,5,,It was amazing to see the Light-Show! Everything was very good organized. The Cloud Forest and the Flower Dom was also amazing.,,
,,Great place to visit,4,,"Very interesting place, especially at night. There鈥檚 a foot bridge that connects you to marina bay sands building. Highly recommend for a visit. You get a really good view from the MBS building",,
,,Outstanding both by day and night,5,,"This is a must do activity if your fortunate enough to visit Singapore for a suitable time frame. The design and layout of these gardens are perfect from an aesthetic and energetic point of view. Easily negotiated on foot with maps throughout to keep you in the right direction.
Like everything at the Marina Bay Area these gardens become illuminated at night time and take on an entirely different complexion. We preferred the night time to fully enhance the design features.",,
,,Garden By The Bay,3,,"Sign board that use to direct visitors to exist need some improvement at Flower Dome. Not only my self, I saw tourist is been mislead too.",,
,,Not to be missed,5,,A very pleasant morning spent wandering through the gardens. We were pleasantly surprised after having been to the botanic gardens the day before. Well worth a visit. Very accessible from the city.,,
,,Gardens By The Bay,5,,"Great place to spend some time. Excellent layout with themed gardens for areas around the world. Suggest take a Audio Tour on the road train, then either target particular themes or allow plenty of time to stroll through theme all.",,
,,Must Visit,5,,". Gardens by the Bay is a huge garden area on back side of marina Bay Sands Hotel. It consists of 2 domes ( one is a Flower Dome and other is a forest in cloud dome ) . it also consists of artificial trees in the garden called SuperGroove Trees and a skywalk connecting all these trees. There are separate tickets to Flower Dome , Cloud in the Forest Dome and Skywalk or you could just buy a combined ticket which is cheaper. There is also a huge garden area on outside with different varieties of gardens which is free and also the supergroove trees which is free. At the end of evening at 7.45 pm there is a light show where all the artificial trees have lights in different colors based on music and that is also free . we got out at BayFront MRT station and first went inside the marina Bay Sands Hotel to go to the top floor to catch a aerial view of Singapore. The views from the top of this Hotel are really very good and you end spending a lot of time taking photographs . The ticket to this is lot cheaper compared to the Singapore Flyer ( same as London eye ) and offers better opportunity of a lot of photography. You can do only one out of the two but I would vote for marina Bay Sands Hotel skypark. After spending a couple of hrs on the Top walked to the Garden in Bay area . first we visited the flower dome. It is a huge air-conditioned dome with different types of flowers. You can easily spend anything from 2 to 3 hrs at this place. After that we went to the Forest in the cloud dome . There is a huge waterfall inside the dome and an indoor forest with different types of plants. You take a elevator to the top and then take a winding road down . again you can spend 2-3 hrs n this one. Both of the domes are worth seeing . After both the domes we walked to the Super groove trees area and stood in line for the ODBC skywalk. There is a elevator which takes you up to the skywalk and you a walk in circle connecting the trees . The views of garden are really good and worth the price. After this we took a spot in the garden lawns below to catch the light show which starts at 7.45 pm and repeats at 8.45 pm also. It is a 15-20 minute show but really great. Do not miss it . Be ready to walk around12-13 kms",,
,,"Quite okay, more selection annual pass.",3,,Quite average visit and my parents quite tired after visit... I planning to buy family package but I only 1 child so not worth it. Hope can get the cheaper family package for annual pass,,
,,Absolutely gorgeous,5,,Make sure when u in Singapore to take a stroll around Gardens by the Bay. Can鈥檛 believe what how man made nature looks. Absolutely gorgeous.,,
,,Follow the yellow brick road,5,,"The overall attraction was wonderful. So many flowers to see, smell and capture all at once. Would be nice to have some we can touch because I'm not sure which one we can! But I loved the sunflowers and succulents. They're all so beautiful!!!",,
,,Nice Architecture,5,,"Going here to see their famous Flower Dome, Cloud Forest, and Supertree Grove. The Flower Dome has many variant of flowers. The Cloud Forest is the most breathtaking one. And in the night just spend some walking to their Supertree Grove for enjoying the spectacular light show for free.",,
,,Sunflower Dome season. - Nice,5,,"Would recommend people during weekdays to avoid the weekend crowd. Though there are still crowd but it is better. Should have go in September as there are some flower that is dying. :(Other than that, love the sunflowers!",,
,,SELDOM TO SEE AMAZING THINGS FOR FREE,5,,"My overall rating is Excellent. During morning we went to Gardens By The Bay and went inside Flower Dome then the Cloud Forest where I saw different shapes, color and shades of flowering plants, unique flowers and different kind of cactus plants. At Cloud Forest I saw different kinds of unique Orchids like pitcher flower.I admire how it was arranged and the efforts incorporated in building such a unique structure. Creation of wonderful plants I saw there makes me thanks Jehovah, the creator of all things.At Revelation 4:11 this is what it said: ""鈥淵ou are worthy, Jehovah our God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power, because you created all things, and because of your will they came into existence and were created.鈥漌e went back at night time by Friday Oct 5, 2018 and we enjoyed the Light Show. I never expected it, only I noticed many more people coming by and just sit on the ground. Its clean and properly maintained.I highly recommend this to everyone.",,
,,Nice scenary,5,,"Every angle is an art piece, environment is good. Easy to get tickets online, just scan the barcode.",,
,,Pleasant Journey,4,,"Purchase the ticket (Resident : Flower Dome + Cloud Forest) online for SGD18 on the spot using my mobile. Dont have to queue up, just proceed to the entrance and scan the bar-code mailed to me. Flower Dome : Sunflower is the current theme.Cloud Forest : Amazed by the view once entered. Took few shots of Boomerang Insta video here.",,
,,Spectacular!,5,,"Well worth a visit. We did a day time tour and the cloud forest and flower domes were very informative and educational and fun! There were lots of young school parties visiting too but they were all extremely well behaved.
We returned in the evening, walking from the Marina Bay sands to the gardens. The spectacular lighting design created a futuristic and fantasy world; I felt like I had walked into the world of 鈥楢vatar鈥?(the movie). Stunning!",,
,,Highlight of Our Trip,5,,"One of the most amazing things I've ever seen! We spent most of our time in the Cloud Forest and with the Super Trees. We went right at 9AM when everything opened and were surprised how few people were there - we had parts of it all to ourselves!

Make sure to block at least a half day to seeing everything",,
,,"Interesting place , amaizing show by night !",5,,I spent a full day in this place visiting and admiring flowers . Interesting is the fact that all investments that are made it in all of capabilities were very well calculated . Everything is done for turist . The tree show in the night was a nice experience !,,
,,Swissotel Namba Osaka,5,,"The rooms are big and their concierge & travel desk staff are awesome. The location is the best as it is a street away from Dotombori & just on the left hand side of the Ground Floor entrance has the Family Mart as well as a 24 hr Ramen shop. Further down the road is MacDonalds. There is also Namba Parks which is a shopping mall with restaurants & Starbucks is there. On the 3rd floor exit of the swissotel - it exits out to the Nankai rapid rail & on that level it also has a mini mart that opens till past midnight & next to it is a shop that sells delicious mochi & cakes. Below the hotel is the Namba City shopping mall with mini cafes / food outlets.
There are also many restaurants above Takashimaya which is annexe to Swissotel. The breakfast at this hotel has a very good spread & if you reserve a day ahead, there is a discounted rate which is about 25% cheaper.
If u do not want to spend Yen 2,800 on this breakfast, you can always go to B1 or B2 of the train stations below n pay Yen 600 for a decent breakfast of coffee & sandwich with eggs at the cafes there. It took awhile to get around but ask the concierge staff as they also provide us with helpful subway directions to places of interest in a well printed piece of note paper which was handy to carry around. This hotel also provides a handy phone.
My only issue was with the reservation staff which I booked my 10 nites stay directly for my family of 4 - it鈥檚 a Long story to narrate but next time, I will book through The AccorHotels website.",,
,,Very enjoyable,5,,"This is a great concept and normally it's not something that would attract me but I enjoyed walking around, however make sure you have a raincoat or umbrella just in case you get caught in a tropical downpour....",,
,,Mesmerizing,5,,"Mesmerizing experience..Must visit if in Singapore. It's wheel chair accessible and show cases flowers, trees and plants varities.",,
,,Outstanding even for someone not into gardens,5,,Really amazing. Great for a hot day as gardens are cool. Loved how they create themes. It was the wizard of Oz when we visited.,,
,,Spectacular,5,,"Do not go to Singapore and not go there. It鈥檚 other worldly, like something from close encounters of a third kind. Music, lights and conservatories full of plants and trees. Amazing.",,
,,Must Visit!!,5,,"I went here along with my wife. It is amazing. Do not miss the Flower Dome, Cloud Forest, OCBC Skywalk and the flower/light show. You can easily spend 2 to 3 hours here. Plan your visit so that you can see the light show.",,
,,Too little for too much,2,,Disappointed with what the place had to offer for the price paid for the ticket. Long walk in the mid afternoon sun to reach the dome exhausted my bones and mood. What did I gain from the visit was the question I asked myself and sadly the answer was 'absolutely nothing'.,,
,,The World's most beautiful garden!,5,,"Fantastic venue for an evening walk or a morning jog. Can't imagine what the super trees will be like once the vines cover them. Look out for the otters.

If you have more time, take a walk to the marina barrage and have a picnic there. Its a fantastic location for families.",,
,,Great at nightime,5,,"We went at dusk so we could see it during the day and do the sky walk and then see the light and sound show.

For the sky walk you buy a ticket and then get allocated a time slot. Ours was 20 minutes later so not too bad.

The light and sound show was good to watch from the grass.",,
,,Fabulous ..... especially the night show set to music,5,,"Quite a way out of the city centre but well worth the drive to get there. We visited morning and night, the night show set to music is fabulous. Amazing set up with so much to see, so many different trees and plants in one location. We took the $8 tram tour around the gardens which has a commentary worth listening to then wandered at our own pace after it. You can walk at different levels to view downwards at the displays.",,
,,Taken to another world,4,,"Walk around the Gardens by the Bay in the evening, an amazing place to visit during the night. The lights around the trees give you the effect of being transported to another world.

There is a light show that takes place every night at 19:45 and 20:45 i would recommend going to the far corner of the gardens as its get busy if you stay in the center area.

All in all a must see when visiting Singapore.",,
,,Nice to visit if you're into flowers and macro photography,4,,"While this is one of the many attractions in the Marina Bay Area, gardens by the bay would be specific to those who like to see various flower-bearing plants and other exotic flora. The nice thing about this garden is that it is fully air-conditioned so it is a great way of beating the hot Singaporean day. It's a good place to take a stroll with elderly and young children. Entrance fees are reasonable.",,
,,Amazing! A must see,5,,"This park is unbelievable. Take the audio tour and see it all with guided explanation, then walk back to the things you want to discover. Really beautiful and the super trees are stunning.",,
,,Fantastic place to visit with family,5,,Fantastic place to visit with family. Visit in the evenings for cool walks around the area. Crowded but spaciousness is ideal,,
,,Love it!,5,,Spend almost the whole day here! Totally like it during the day & definitely love it during the night! Crazy beautiful place! Worth every penny!,,
,,Good experience,4,,A good collection of sunflowers. Very well maintained plants and flowers. The temperature inside the domes were just nice. Need to keep the public toilets a little cleaner with more frequent servicing.,,
,,An unforgettable Experience,5,,"Firstly, I was amazed by the architectural feat of garden dome. Many species of plants not found in the tropical regions were displayed in stratified levels of walkways giving us the experience of a hanging garden. The hanging bridges also allows us to view the plants in close proximity but yet allowing us to view the scenery and skyline of Singapore. My children were excited about the experience and since we have returned 3 times. Simply fascinating.",,
,,Must do,5,,"Absolutely amazing scenery. Definite must do when in Singapore. The bay itself is massive and you can pass an easy hour taking pictures, walking round; even to get to the gardens itself is a nice walk.",,
,,An architectual wonder,4,,Only went for the cloud forest. Its literally and figuratively speaking very cool to walk around. Went in the afternoon. Ticket is valid for the whole day and you can ask for a stamp as well in order not needing to safe ticket,,
,,Fantastic experience,5,,"We made the visit to Gardens on the bay in the evening and the views were amazing.Highly recommend for families and couples ,",,
,,Family visit - fabulous! And so much is free!,5,,"We did both domes and the gardens. Will visit all again. Really lived the cloud dome more than the flower dome, magical. Stayed for the light show which was fabulous! Will return often. I hadn鈥檛 realised how much of the garden is free admittance so go see the super trees and light shows, it鈥檚 free!!",,
,,Terrific spot,5,,"An enjoyable visit - taken in two parts on consecutive days.

The Two domes are full of interesting plants and displays. The super trees lit up well with beautiful music in the evening.

A great day.

To visit the super tree lights go a bit early and be prepared to sit on the ground. Tons of people as we visited in a Saturday night. There was some shuffling to get up the exit stairs but the numbers cleared soon.

On Saturday there were tons of kites flying at the marina. Satay by the bay did a roaring trade in good food.",,
,,Lantern Festival,5,,"We visited during the Lantern/Mid Autumn Festival. Beautiful lanterns on pontoons, near the super trees and domes. Activities for children to partake. We also visited the Flower Dome with the beautiful sunflowers. Always impressive and worthwhile another visit!",,
,,Eden Project on steroids!,4,,"Anyone who has visited Cornwall鈥檚 Eden Project will enjoy these beautiful gardens and will understand why I鈥檝e given my review this title - everything is larger than Eden, and some parts - especially in the flower dome - are a bit 鈥楧isneyfied鈥? I visited as part of a small-group tour on a weekday morning and there was no queues for the domes or for the OCBC Skyway which connects two of the trees in the Supertree Grove (additional charge; such a pity that this doesn鈥檛 link more of the trees to make it longer as the views are spectacular).

I much preferred the Cloud Forest, with its treetop and cloud walkways, to the Flower Dome, though the latter did have some superb baobabs and really ancient olive trees as well as pretty flowers and shrubs. The flower field featured sunflowers and a somewhat bizarre Wizard of Oz theme when I visited. Elsewhere, characters from Alice in Wonderland were scattered amongst the plants. There鈥檚 plenty of information about the exhibits in each dome, with especially useful information on the importance of cloud forests in that dome.

Our tour schedule did not give us time to explore the extensive outdoor areas and I鈥檇 certainly visit if ever in Singapore again, probably in the evening to enjoy the light show, though we鈥檇 already seen these from above from the top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel the previous evening.",,
,,Leisure trip,4,,Well worth a visit beautiful sites greenery plants unusual trees especially their roots. Shuttle services very convenient no waiting etc. Very picturesque. One can easily spend 4 5 hours and come back relaxed with a feeling of a day well spent at the gardens,,
,,worth a visit,5,,Enjoyed an afternoon and evening at Gardens by the Bay. Beautiful place and was worth the visit. Easy to get to on the MRT from orchard Rd Station. Light show was great.,,
,,Just Awesome...,4,,Simply awesome. Had spent the whole day vising the inner part. But by the evening it turned out as a musical valley...the family liked it most. the kids were very very happy to see the lightnings. A must avail family trip to experience.,,
,,Fantastic,5,,Excellent way to spend a day enjoying the free access and affordable to visit the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest Too Do t miss the evening Rhapsody Light Show one of the best experiences of the whole trip,,
,,Incredible Attraction,5,,2 parts to the Gardens by the Bay. Super tree Grove is free and a must see when in Singapore. Light and music show at 19.45 each night. It is worth paying the ticket fee to walk along the sky walk. The enclosed gardens have an entrance fee. It is worth doing as it is quite incredible. Bonus is it鈥檚 fully air conditioned inside!,,
,,Spectacular,5,,"This is a wonderful experience.We went in the evening and it was so pleasant to be able to visualise the plant aquarium as it is well lit for evening viewing.Its a must for all travellers.The light display at time schedules is spectacular to sit and enjoy.
I would recommend that the restaurants stay open an hour longer as if you wish to eat after they close at 10pm.",,
,,Just WOW!,5,,The whole precinct is amazing. The only thing that slowed us down was the heat! The gardens are amazing & the giant trees mind blowing. The light show is also definately worth seeing.,,
,,Great day,4,,"This is well worth a visit, you can watch the night light and music show for free. The walk way for eight dollars is okay and the other two builds would cost you twenty eight dollars.",,
,,Sunflower exhibition,5,,What a beautiful exhibition so picturesque just like a fairytale. Great exhibits from all corners of the world . Congrats Singapore keep up your amazing 5star standard .,,
,,Great time!,5,,"Definitely a must place to visit when in Singapura, the garden and all the surrounding area is so beautiful. Night is best for visiting.",,
,,must visit,5,,This was amazing the design inside and out the amount of work in side to keep you walking with the garden lay out amazing plants and the themes lovely indoor water fall with viewing platforms well done would recommend.,,
,,A must whilst in Singapore!,5,,"A real must visit whilst in Singapore - if you have time go during the day and in the evening to see it differently. It鈥檚 so beautiful, the living trees are amazing. If you want to spend some money you can also visit the cloud forest and flower dome which are amazing too.",,
,,It鈥檚 ok,3,,"HINT: signup for the Sands loyalty programme to get a discount on some of the attractions here. We paid $78 for 3 people for both the garden and cloud attractions. Both take about 40 mins to go around.

As an achievement they are something, with self sustaining climates in a country on the equator, but I wasn鈥檛 all that interested in what was on offer.

In the gardens the theme was Wizard of Oz, and there was an odd mix of Willy wonka (60鈥檚) style sets with real flowers. Definitely something different.

The cloud venue was more subtropical, but the kicker at the top of the climb was that the plants were made of LEGO...

Both popular with folks and busy, but cooler than the heat outside!",,
,,I Visited At Night,4,,"I can鈥檛 say much about the buildings or the walkways as they were closed when we went. We arrived around 9:30/10 pm on a Saturday evening, the weather was hot but not unbearable. Everything was lit up and there wasn鈥檛 too much of a crowd. There were people around almost always, but other than a few key spots we were basically on our own.

Best of all, other than the restaurant in the main tree structure, everything available was free. The buildings were impressively lit up, and the greenery was tastefully lit up as well. We had many occasions to just wonder and explore with no one around. It was quite enough, and just as I鈥檇 hopped. We might return in the future during the day, but if we don鈥檛, I鈥檒l be very happy with our night experience.",,
,,Lovely way to spend a couple of hours,4,,Visited here with two colleagues when in town in business. It's a great walk round the gardens and a lovely way to spend a couple of hours.,,
,,Well worth visiting,5,,We really enjoyed viewing Gardens By The Bay. It was a great activity to do to get out of the heat and the displays were magnificent.,,
,,Try and go in the day and in the night,5,,"With just 24 hours in Singa, we wanted to make the most of our time there - we went to the gardens in the evening and was blown away by the beauty of the place, it is very safe, very family friendly and a must! We paid to go up to the bar in the trees ($20) each which wasn't cheap but well worth it for the spectacular views. We ate in Satay by the Bay - an area within the gardens with lots of independent food outlets.
We decided to return the next day to get the experience in the daylight and really glad we did! Did the bio-domes and the skywalk and would highly recommend this even though there is a small charge
Just mind-blowing! Do not miss the opportunity to explore this little piece of heaven!",,
,,Engrossed by the beautiful garden,5,,"I was stunned at how beautiful it was. Vast area, I don't think one day can cover it all. The view at night was superb, the lights, the area. No words can properly describe what I see.",,
,,Super nice,5,,"We spent the day over there, very nice and worth the visit. Garden is accessible for baby stroller. Still some wild animals living in the garden",,
,,"Stunning doesn鈥檛 seem to cut it, but it鈥檚 a MUST visit",5,,"Great place, stunning architecture with innovative ideas and layouts. Now getting expensive, and this can make it expensive for large families, but hey, at least do it once!!",,
,,Uplifting and absorbing for any age.,5,,Probably best to go an hour or so before dark so you have time to wander around the 2 large enclosed gardens then as the night comes and the lights come on it is magical.,,
,,Each visit a surprise,5,,"This is a must to see in Singapore.
The garden is immense. And the conservatories fantastic.

They change the flower displays very often so there will be always something new.

This time was sunflowers with the wizard of oz theme. It was so beautiful. Definitely coming back.",,
,,Only did the free stuff,5,,We went to Gardens By The Bay for a look with young children. We didn鈥檛 think paying for children鈥檚 ticket was worth it as they don鈥檛 have a big attention span. We went to the kids water park and it was fun for them and adults too.. just remember to pack bathers. The gardens that we saw were amazing and the domes I would guess take it up a notch so would be worth it.,,
,,Gardens by the Bay Visit,4,,My adult son wanted to visit after viewing a documentary on TV about it. I must say that it was a beautiful place to visit and admire nature and the setup of how its been presented. Plenty of attractions to see which requires a full day at an easy pace. Enjoyed the views at the restaurant with a refreshing drink. A good father son time together.,,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,"Absolutely stunning a must see, lovely to stroll around at your own leisure, beautiful and well manicured gardens",,
,,Wonderful Flower Dome and rainforest dome and lighted trees with music,5,,"A really wonderful experience and presentation of the nature, in the evening glorius Lightshow and music",,
,,Fantastic,5,,"Famous attraction in Singapore, well worth visiting. Be sure to catch the light show at 7.45 and 8.45 every night. 8.45 best one. Advice would be not to leave directly after light show if travelling by taxi! 1 hour queue on a Tuesday evening!",,
,,Breathtaking and a must see,5,,Been to see this before but it is a must to see again and again. The night light and music show is always a sight to see. There are always so many people and it is always crowded.,,
,,Beautiful,5,,"Beautiful Gardens, a must to see when travelling Singapore. The Flower Dome was very pretty with beautiful displays. The Cloud Rainforest was my favourite, lovely to see it with the cloud mist. Both Domes were stunning and quite large. Easy to get to by MRT. Night show is amazing with beautiful lights display. We spent an afternoon and evening walking through the beautiful Gardens. Will definitely go back and see this again.",,
,,An oasis in the city,5,,"I am biased, let鈥檚 put that out there first. I love gardening and have been wanting to visit for a few years.
It is expensive, so if you have a discount code or voucher, like the Singapore airline boarding pass, make sure you use it.
Walking into the flower dome, you will hear multiple sighs of relief from the heat. We spend a few hours in both domes. We were in the flower and cloud domes from 10ish to about almost 2pm.
Then did the touristy thing and took the shuttle bus that took us to a mere 5 min walk to the marina bay sands shopping centre
It鈥檚 one of those places that will amaze even the non garden lovers",,
,,Unbelievable Gardens by the Bay,5,,Thie Gardens by the Bay are a must visit in Singapore. This has been extremely well thought out and set up. Allow a day to wonder through the wonderful exhibitions and you must visit the 2 pavilions. Striking.,,
,,Company Anniversary,4,,"Having a function in the Flower field hall, flower dome. Is very nice and good. After the event you can visit the dome. The food is OK only.",,
,,A MUST SEE!,5,,This is one of the most beautiful places i have ever seen. Everything is so well manicured. The night show rhapsody was fun to watch the best view is from standing under the trees as we could see everything. Dont forget to eat at Satay On The Bay the skewer sticks were tasty and other variety of foods too.,,
,,Beautiful gardens,4,,The gardens are beautiful. I would recommend paying extra to go into the flower dome and cloud forest. I would recommend staying for the light show which is good. Easily accessible to the metro station. Toilets are spread out.,,
,,Part of paradise,5,,Only you should go and see . Any words can not say any thing about this place . If you are not stsy at the hotel you should buy ticket and by the elevstor you can go at the top of hotel . Very nice place and amazing . At the day you can see a very good view from city at top,,
,,Garden visit,5,,"I was a little skeptical, but was soon wowed by the beauty of the gardens. We visited both the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome both pretty amazing and well worth it. We went early about 9:30, no queues and no crowds. We took our time and then walked over to the Marina Sands complex for lunch and some shopping.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,Gardens by the bay is a beautiful way of saving the world! So many amazing things to do including the two domes and the sky walk it really is overwhelming for your eyes to see so many beautiful things! A must do on a trip to Singapore and well priced to say it鈥檚 so well known,,
,,Fabulous at night,4,,"We went in the evening.Super trees are stunning at night. Cloud forest and flower dome are very beautiful. But, as a Sri Lankan there is no wondering when looking at cloud forest and flower dome because there are lot of natural waterfalls,Flowers and forests can be seen in Sri Lanka.",,
,,Gardens by the ABay,5,,Well set out and many interesting things to see. What a great attraction for the City keep it up. The flowers and Cactus display is something to see.,,
,,must see attraction in sngapore,5,,"wow, the gardens by the bay and the conservatories a re a really amazing place, i don't feel that in a day i did them justice, they are immaculate, some really beautiful planting and landscaping, plants from all over the world, my next visit i shall be back, for me this is the top of the list of things to do and see in Singapore",,
,,FABULOUS,5,,"This was a glorious morning. The cloud and Flower dome gardens were lovely. The only comment i have is the revolting FAKE ornaments around the garden ie plastic staligmites, plain stupid. Otherwise most enjoyable.",,
,,Cool interior,4,,The weather in Singapore was still oppressively hot so the gardens are an rascals from the heat and humidity. This month focuses on sunflowers which were bright in full bloom. Most people were preoccupied with taking the right photo and not enjoying the garden but the crowds move along quickly.,,
,,Stunning Display,5,,"Breathtakingly beautiful, the work that has gone into these gardens is outstanding. Sunflower display in the flower dome runs from now until 21 October it鈥檚 a must. The Cloud Forest was amazing. If you are travelling with elderly parents the heat can be a bit oppressive but inside the domes is air conditioned so quite comfortable. Coming from the Marina Bay hotel to the right at the bottom off the escalators is a shuttle service to take you over to the domes, $3.00 per person return. When you come back the MRT station entrance is only 20 metres walk.",,
,,Get off the Cloud Computer and into the Cloud Forest,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is our go-to stop for visitors staying with us from our home country, Australia. It has never disappointed for groups as various as individuals, families, seniors and kids and I even took a self-declared 'botanically challenged' mate who loved it. I favour the Cloud Dome purely because the other garden favour Australian and British fauna I'm more accustomed to but Eastern visitors may prefer the other. A cool respite, marvelous structure and a pleasant stroll through the rainforest!",,
,,Gardens by the bay ( day and night),4,,"If you happen to visit gardens by the bay in Singapore,, try to go there during the day, its a little bit hot and humid but, you can appreciate it much better without the lights, coz during night time, its loaded with tourists and positioning themselves for better view of the light show.. so its better to go there during the day and come back at night for the light show..",,
,,Night or day??,5,,"The gardens are truly amazing and well worth the visit (and I鈥檓 NOT a plant/flower person). During the day you really get to see the true colours of the plants. The Cloud forest dome is air conditioned and you walk right in under the waterfall. This is a fantastic relief from the SG heat. As you spiral up to the canopy walkways, there are amazing hidden ponds and sculptures to see. Outside is quite nice, but is hot. You鈥檙e always looking for shade.
Night time was just a good, but the crowds are big. Expect a line to buy tickets to the skywalk and then line to get up the lift. The light show at 7.45pm and 8pm is fantastic.
I would visit again but not Day and night, just one.",,
,,Hot - humid - but a nice area to visit and walk!,4,,"Nicely planned area with good paths for easy walking.SG can be humid, but caters to the nice gardens and wonderful colours.",,
,,An incredible piece of mastery,5,,"The gardens by the bay were an immense reclaimed project in Singapore, to a cost of $6 billions Singapore dollars. The landscape, ponds, artificial tree towers, and the adjacent bay make it a green paradise in the city state. It is most incredible at night, especially when looking at the incredible Marina Bay Sands hotel.",,
,,Avoid the crowds,3,,Unusual and worth the visit however try and avoid the times when the masses from the nearby MBS hotel descend upon it.,,
,,A must visit while in Singapore,5,,The gardens are a combination of modern technology and traditional gardening concepts. The flower dome and cloud forest are not to be missed. Super tree grove and the light show every night are a treat. The OCBC skyway is excellent as well. You could catch the view of the imposing marina bay sands from the gardens as well.,,
,,Supertrees,5,,"Gardens in the Bay is a must see. Spend an afternoon walking and taking in the sites.Plenty of restaurants to choose from if desired. The highlight is obviously the light show in the evening. Music and entertainment abound. Chinese orchestra along with local schoolchildren gave a stunning performance. The evening setting could not be better, Marina Bay Sands lit with lasers and Singapore Wheel dazzling in the background. Perfect way to finish the day!",,
,,OMG!,5,,"Out of all the experiences we had in Singapore this was an absolute standout. I never thought that something man made could be so beautiful and peaceful. It's probably the jewel in Singapore's crown. I'd travel back there just to experience it all over again. The FREE show kicks off around 8pm and goes for around an hour. It can be quite busy on the weekend so get there before the sun goes down and find a good vantage point. You'll enjoy this much more by lying down on a bench or pathway and just looking up to the sky.
Truly time well spent.
Singapore...you rock!",,
,,Fun and Unique,5,,The Gardens by the Bay are a really unique botanical garden set up with the electrical powered super trees right in the heart of the gardens. Day and night visits provide their own unique experiences. The cloud and flower dooms are nice 45-60 minutes walks with various specious of plant life and great views of the bay. This is a must see if visiting Singapore.,,
,,Amazing place and awesome sights!,5,,"Wow what a spectacle and awesome showcase this is for Singapore. Having been to a few great things in Singapore this has been a standout!
It caters for all ages - our young kids (3,6 &9) were in awe of the amazing buildings. The Cloud Forest had them captured especially with the phenomenal waterfall as you walk in and the walkways up high were very exciting too.
The flower dome wasn鈥檛 as exciting for them but certainly had my husband and I in amazement at the variety of plants/flowers and the set up.
There is also a really great kids water play area - which was a highlight for them. Great to cool off and just be kids - adults can go in too, just make sure you adhere to their rules or you鈥檒l get whistled!!!
The Supertrees - when we first walked in, the kids spotted them, and then we caught the end of a light and sounds show - wow!! Fantastic!!
Well worth a visit and you could quite easily spend half a day admiring and taking it all in.
Would highly recommend going afternoon/evening to catch the light and sound show at the Supertrees - you can also get dinner at the Satay by the Bay hawker centre which is really close by.",,
,,Extraordinary Supertrees,5,,"Do not leave Singapore without visiting Gardens by the Bay garden rhapsody at 7.45pm each night. Through the the month of October you will be Immersed in tunes from popular musical numbers like The Phantom Of The Opera, Les Miserables and Chicago as the spectacular Supertrees illuminate the night sky! It was the best thing I have seen in Singapore. Catch the MRT to Bayfront and then head for the Supertrees. Tthere is a lovely grass oval to sit on to enjoy the 15 minute show.",,
,,Love the view,5,,Ensure your camera is fully charged and plan an enough time to enjoy it. Recommend to wear comfortable shoes!,,
,,Amazing!,5,,"The gardens were amazing! We didn't realise there would be a musical show so make sure you visit for that, it was at 9pm when we went!",,
,,Worth a day and night visit,4,,"Visually spectacular - worth going for a stroll through in the evening and catch the light show, and then back the next day to visit the cloud forest and flower gardens within their oversized terrariums (although can be done in one evening if you leave enough time, cloud forest and flower gardens shut at 9pm)",,
,,Birthday celebration,5,,It a very nice and colourful place for some photos taking The range of beautiful flowers and botanic and the spacious environment plus aircon provide a pleasant and enjoyable visit.,,
,,Spectacular!!!!!,5,,"OMG this place is beyond spectacular!
You simply must visit during the day and at night! It is truly breathtaking. Much of the area is free but it is well worth spending a few $ to do the skywalk, Flower Dome and Cloud Dome.
Honestly there are not enough superlatives to describe this place - one of the most amazing places I have ever seen in my life!!!!",,
,,Singapore trip will not be complete without another visit to the Gardens By The Bay,5,,"Daytime or nighttime, the Gardens is a sure winner for any visitor who enters it. Going there during the Mid Autumn festival gave us a new look of the gardens with the big colorful lanterns on display. Crossing the walkway from the Marina Bay Sands to the gardens treated us with the colorful purple bougainvillea flowers in full bloom at that time. For the first time, i was able to get in the Cloud Forest. Tough luck that the Flower Dome was closed during that day for maintenance. As usual, passing under the Supertrees provides one hell of an experience.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,There are Botanical Gardens in Singapore which we did not get to see but these gardens must rate highly as one of the best. A walk around these gardens can take an hour or several hours with many photo opportunities,,
,,Good.,4,,Try and visit in the evenings as morning it鈥檚 super sunny and hot. The cloud forest is good to walk around and click pictures of the installations. Flower dome was unfortunately clothes the day we visited.,,
,,Bad weather trip,5,,"When the weather is bad, visit the gardens by the bay, nice temperature, nice flowers, nice 2 hour spending trip",,
,,WOW!!! Incredible,5,,This was the main attraction I wanted to visit on my trip to Singapore and I was not disappointed. The work involved in setting these up must be incredible but much appreciated.,,
,,"Amazing Structure, Views and Plant life",4,,"When you see this place from a distance and when you see outward from the skywalk from within will blow you away. It is an amazing building/structure. If you are into photography, be sure to bring your tripod and zoom lens. The internal atmosphere is very soothing and calming. A must see when you are in Singapore.",,
,,Family holiday,5,,"This place is a must to visit in Singapore. The Cloud Conservatory was amazing with the waterfall. The floral conservatory had displays featuring flora from different continents and was beautiful with sunflowers. Plenty of food options for all budgets. The water park and kids adventure playground were a hug hit with the children, and all free to enjoy. At night it transforms into a beautiful illuminated wonderland.",,
,,Very nice and quiet place with all the plants from all over the world,5,,"It is a very nice place to visit. It consists of two dimes of plants around the world. The first dome has a waterfall and you can see it from the bottom or high up. The second dome has some has very nice displays, which from time to time.",,
,,awesome display,5,,walk for hours and enjoy the amazing variety of flowers and plants. So well organised you cant miss a thing.,,
,,Evening is best time,3,,Not much as I expected.evenings are better when lights are on.don't miss the light show.visited both domes.i was a bit disappointed.there is scope to take lots of photos.just a garden with many flowers and plants.,,
,,Go late afternoon & stay for the light show,5,,"Big, lovely, peaceful despite the crowds. Observatories are $$$ so we didn't visit them, but did do the supertree walkway - great views up to $8 per person. Go late afternoon, and find a spot on the grass area to stay for the daily light show....worth the effort but be warned if you have prams/disabilities the queue for the lift to get back into mrt station afterwards was a nightmare!",,
,,Impressive,5,,This was another wonderful place to visit. The diverse gardens were a treat! The indoor design and comfort was really great.,,
,,Loved the cloud walk,4,,There are two sections flower and cloud; the cloud one is breath taking and its really amazing. Would recommend it. The light show is also good,,
,,Great chillout spot,4,,"A great spot to chill, wander and rest only minutes away from the buzz of the city. Don't miss the light/music shows in the evening at 7.45pm and 8.45pm",,
,,Extraordinary Gardens,5,,"Wow! Can鈥檛 believe these Gardens were only conceived in 2005!
The gardens are filled with mature trees and lush plantings. The highlight of this visit is the huge, two domes in which gardens have been created.
The Flower Dome includes plants from all over the world. Ancient Olive trees, Bottle trees and stunning sculptures throughout.
The Cloud Forest Dome is an amazing creation including a mountain of greenery through which you walk on an elevated path after catching the lift to reach the top.",,
,,GARDENS BY THE BAY,5,,I am always fascinated by the Gardens with its 2 domes and supertrees. I highly recommend for every visitor to see all of them.,,
,,Great experience,5,,"If you are having a few days in Singapore this is a must do for the family , great day out .Well priced and very entertaining.",,
,,Best garden ever,5,,"Very relaxing and nicely organized the flower dome and the cloud forest. When you enter you feel the nice flower smell. You must try both day and night. 7:45 pm there is a light show in the big ecological tree towers. First impression is that this place must consume a lot of energy to keep air conditioned inside, but then you start to learn about the giant tree towers鈥?sustainable energy and water retailing and recirculating system. Fantastic!
Must try
Can鈥檛 load more pictures.",,
,,Fantastic,5,,A must see. Sound and music display at night is amazing 馃憤 a well worth visit. Get there early to get a good seat otherwise it鈥檚 standing room only,,
,,wondertul light and music show!,4,,"We went to Gardens by the 'Bay at two different times. The first time we went, we did it to scout out the area so that we would have our bearings when we came back for the light and music show at night. It is convenient since the MRT has a stop right there. . The light show starts at 7:45p and then again at 8:45p .It is difficult to know where the best place to stand is to view the light show. It last about 15 minutes and is really spectacular. It is well worth setting the time aside to see the landscaping and flowers and to appreciate the lights and the music. I would highly recommend.",,
,,Amazing experience,5,,"You could spend a whole day there and then go again at night. Singapore really knows how to put together an attraction. Educational, beautiful and thought provoking, I think it is a must see when visiting Singapore",,
,,Interesting,4,,Suggestive especially at night with various lights and games of colors. Pity some areas close a little early.,,
,,Not to be Missed,5,,Make sure you include this attraction if in Singapore - just beautiful (like the entire city). Be sure to come back at night for the light show/music. Iconic for Singapore!,,
,,Family Time at the Gardens by the Bay,5,,"With 2 teenage sons in tow, this was the one place during our visit to Singapore that we could agree on. The 3 of us had a splendid time watching the evening Rhapsody show. We lay on our backs on the clean park and watched in wonderment as the show began and played. It was Moon Festival time and the mix of Asian and Western music with themes of the moon in their lyrics to the coordination of the changing lights of the super trees was simply magical. And the outside of this park is opened to the public at no cost. Only the cooled conservatories required a fee, Flower dome and cloud forest, required tickets; we enjoyed the cooled conservatories very much as well. It was a wonderful experience for us and for once, my sons also found the snacks at the food kiosks much to their liking.",,
,,Recommend!,5,,I visited twice this year as my favorites flowers are there馃尫馃尫馃尫馃尰馃尰馃尰.Recommended for all the tourist visiting Singapore or I would say a must visit place.Thank you Flower dome for bringing my lovely flowers here.馃尶,,
,,AMAZING,5,,Pictures on Google just doesn鈥檛 do this place justice We went to the bar for $20singapore dollars and have a free alcoholic beverage and the views were phenomenal A must visit!!,,
,,Beautiful flowers,5,,Really enjoyed seeing all the beautiful flowers and the landscape!The whole family really enjoyed it.,,
,,Nature Lovers Dream,4,,"this is opne of the best memories of the plcae i visited, i truly feel like i was in a different world when i entered this place. Defeninetly worth a visit",,
,,Biodomes,5,,"The biodiversity and structure of the flower dome and cloud forest is impressive. The cloud dome is cooler and therefore offers greater relief from the Singapore heat. Easiest access is via the Bayfront MRT station and a 5"" walk. There are audio tours of the area by app or shuttle bus and is a full day & night activity. Plan your day to include the Garden Rhapsody light/sound show @ 7:45pm.",,
,,Gardens By The Bay,4,,"It was a very enjoyable outing with the whole family including my grandchildren. Actually there are nothing to comment because everything was so beautiful. What I would like to find is more sitting areas where older people can sit down. The Gardens are not small in size so walking is never easy for older people. I have seen older people looking for some space to rest their tired feet - some were seen sitting on the stone slabs blocking people like me who want to see more clearly the flowers. Snacks and drinks are not found inside. I know the management wants to keep the environment spit and span but I am also sure that the management can choose an area where they can throw their leftovers in the bins. Provide more bins. That will be all and hopefully my next visit I can see my suggestions be answered. Thanks,",,
,,very nice layout.,4,,good hangout place for weekend for family gathering. can really enjoy the the walk in evening with awesome view of the Garden By The Bay setup & light effect. The 2 flower Dome is a must visit place for first time visitor.,,

,,Incredible Sights,5,,"We were truely amazed by the infrastructure, beauty and detail of this place. We saw the light and sound show as part of a small tour and that was fantastic. We came back the next day to visit each Dome and do the Sky Walk. Absolutely amazing! this was the highlight of our Singapore two day stop over.",,
,,Sunflower?,5,,The number of sunflowers less than my hair count. I was expecting to see 4metres sunflower or sunflower seeds. or sunflower oil. No sunflower products available in gift shop. The ambience is good. It isnot too crowded. The place is kept clean and tidy. Definitely worth the visit to see variety of sunflowers. The flowers look healthy and beautiful.,,
,,Spectacular at night FREE,4,,We were confused the actual gardens by the bay are FREE and lights up at 7.45pm and 8.45pm at night. You will need to pay for Skywalk access 15min session at a time...also for access to Cloudforrest and Flowerdome. Im not a huge garden fan so $38 entry free for both seemed overpriced to me however it was a welcome relief to be in air con. Waterfall is lovely. Best way to do it is go early in the morning. Then come back at night for light show. Do get your ticket stamped with a passout so you can re enter cloudforrest and Flower dome later if you didn't get to see it all during the day. Walk ti Satay Bay after light show for a huge variety of food in an open air market foid court delicious..Must see Singapore.,,
,,Amazing,5,,"What an amazing place to Visit. These 2 domes are really beautiful, different and amazing. One dome is floral and the other one is all plants. I like the plant one myself.
$38.entry for both(you have to pay entry for both). It took us about 2 hours to go through both.
A defiant when visiting Singapore.",,

,,Truly Amazing.,5,,I visited this place when it was almost dark in the evening. The view is just superb. The show of lights and music is wonderful. Happy vibes and the time I spent there was just amazing.,,
,,Lovely,5,,A must see place if you are visiting Singapore. We went late afternoon so we would be there for the evening light show. It was busy but manageable. I would be tempted to stay later as it was very crowded leaving after the show.,,
,,Enjoyable visit,5,,We visited the Gardens by the Bay one afternoon. We went inside both the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. The Cloud Forest had a ceiling to floor waterfall which you could go right to the top to see. (lifts available). The Flower Dome had a Sunflower Theme so there were hundreds of sunflowers. In the evening there is a light show from the 'trees'. The light show is accompanied by music and lasted about 15 mins. This show is on twice a night. On the way back to the MRT we saw the 'Baby' sculpture by Mark Quinn. This baby weighs 7 ton and appears to be floating.,,
,,Garden by the bay,5,,One of the most interested and must place to visit in Singapore. you can access it from the observatory deck of Marina by the Bay hotel as well. Great place to spent time in evening and see the sound and light show. Must visit the indoor dome forest.,,

,,A Must Visit,5,,Both the Flower Dome & Cloud Forest are beautiful. There's always something new in the Flower Dome. The best one was Tulips Exhibitions (was magical). Cloud Forest boast a man made majestic looking waterfalls. The overhead bridge gives us a perfect view of the whole settings. Must visit. Check out their website for new exhibitions. Don't forget to go on the Supertree Grove (which is the skyway walk - best timing would be in the evening),,
,,lots of different activity spaces beyond the domes,4,,Good place for families to visit as GBB also introduces new activities to do and enjoy. need more fairs and play areas.,,
,,BEAUTIFULLY MAINTAINED GARDENS,5,,"I have been to the GBTB many times and everytime I go, I wish I can visit more. The plants and flowers there are such a beautiful sight.

,,A unique masterpiece- Gardens By The Bay.,5,,"I proud to be a Singaporean, seeing garden by the bay many time and I still don't get board. The arctithec is just amazing and it just breath taking.

It is marvelous one day trip as the Garden are so well architected .. While walking inside the Garden, we feel as if we are in real natural sense...My grand-daughter enjoyed so much . It is definitely worth a pay a visit if you happened to be in S'pore for holidays....",,

,,Green wide spaces within the cityscape,5,,"I absolutely love coming to Gardens by the Bay. Especially great at night when the lights are on. It's a good spot to come by whether one is cycling through, having a couple's evening stroll, or in a large groups or family outings. Lots to see nearby. The Marina Barrage is another must-see at the other end of the Gardens. And of course, must not miss the local food ""satay"" at the food center.",,
,,Brisk walk in the night,5,,"Convenient to reach Garden By The Bay By MRT , Station is at Bayfront and there are signage all around to direct you to the Garden and just tak about 5-10 mins walk to reach the garden. The weather is cooling during the night ~ take a walk thru the garden, is awesome!",,
,,Wonderful,5,,"What an experience. As a landscape designer, this place is a wonder. Well designed, innovative, well planted and maintained and to be on the sky walk when the lights are on is well with it.",,

,,Keeping in touch with nature,5,,It was a very rewarding experience. The crew was very helpful and nice. The place was big and beautiful. What we鈥檝e visited was the cloud forest and flower garden. The cloud forest was very informative and it I really like the feel of nature that it gives off. The movie presentation is also nice and I enjoyed it. The flower garden is one of the prettiest places I鈥檝e been. The contrast of colors and sizes of each plant is perfect for a romantic walk for couples 鉂わ笍鉂わ笍鉂わ笍,,
,,Christmas outing,5,,This place is an excellent place for flowers lovers and for people who wants to admire/learn more about flowers and plants. The flowers and plants display changes with theme. Also a great place for the elderly or families with babies or young toddlers on pram. It is wheelchair friendly too.,,

,,Completely unique,5,,Definitely worth seeing both during the day but also at night! Such a beautiful unique experience for young and old,,
,,Lights spectacular,5,,"Definitely a must see is the light show, it is amazing to see the lights dance to the beat of the music. We got a tip from a local to watch the light show then walk around the other side of the bay to watch another light show on the water.",,
,,amazing!,5,,"All the park is beautiful. My advice: devote a full day to the Gardens. We went in the afternoon, and we had the time to see only one of the indoor gardens before the lights and music show started. We missed the other indoor gardens, that are impressive. The night show is great, by the giant trees at 8 p.m.",,
,,Gardens by the bay,5,,"Absolutely wonderful, well worth the trip to Singapore, we have been to Sinpagore many times, but this trip was especially to see the gardens, & it didn't dissapoint. The 1st dome is all the flowers, orchids, & so many other plants I thought that was great & then into the 2nd dome & that was all the rain forest plants & ferns, we stayed for hours, wear good walking shoes. Highly recommended.",,
,,Missed opportunity,4,,"We bought tickets for both Botanic houses. The flora from around the world had a strange Wizard of Oz temporary Sunflower display. I get the appeal and it was beautiful.
The second glasshouse was disappointing - high walkways circling the central structure. Lovely waterfall but not much else to look at. The conservation awareness film and messages are great, but as a total experience, underwhelming.",,
,,Very good value for $56SGD for two adults (for domes),4,,"We went here on a wet day as this offers two indoor domes out of the weather. We went around the Cloud Forest first which is quite spectacular as you work your way up inside the dome 鈥?not the faint hearted as the views down are dizzying! We next went around the Flower Dome, which has a changing season flower display 鈥?when we visited it was sunflower surprise Wizard of Oz themed display. Not quite as spectacular as the Cloud Dome but very interesting especially for any amateur gardener or horticulturalist. We then had a walk around Supertree Grove (unfortunately the Skyway was closed due to lightening threat) and had a drink awaiting the free daily sound and light show 7.45pm and 8.45pm 鈥?well worth seeing even in the light rain that was falling! You can also get a ride on the train that goes around the park for a few SGD. We did not have time or the weather to explore the whole area but I imagine you could easily spend a day here. Very good value for $56SGD for two adults.",,
,,Good place for kids and old,5,,Amazing places good for kids and old. Well decorated and nice. Highly recommended . The night light show is amazing,,
,,Amazing!,5,,"This was the best thing we saw in Singapore. Definitely, worth the price of admission. Make sure your little ones bring their swimmers for the free water park and come back by latest 7:20pm for the free light show under the Super Tree Grove at 7:45pm - it鈥檚 very popular!",,
,,Amazing place,5,,"Visited with my 18 yr old son. Stunning views from the sky bridge and cloud dome. Well worth the ticket price. Quiet when we visited 13th Sept so no queues for sky bridge, domes and food etc. Taxi rank at venue so very easy to travel too. The towers light up at night and change colour worth a visit am and pm for a different perspective but there is a viewing platform at the marina bay hotel to see the garden at night.",,
,,Wonderful day out.,5,,"A fantastic place to visit for all ages and only a short walk from the MRT station.
The gardens are outstanding and so much to see. After a short stroll around the gardens we went to the mountain dome, truly a sight to see. We spent about two hours here. There is a lift to one floor below the top and a flight of steps to the top you can then stroll back down the mountain with plenty to see on the way.
We then went in to the flower dome, again outstanding. So much to see and do.
We had a 9 year old with us and she was mesmerised by everything she saw and very keen to learn about the different plants etc, it is set out in a way that is very child friendly.
We ate lunch in the restaurant next to the mountain dome,excellent food and service.
We had afternoon tea in the flower dome, again excellent food and service.
We then went to explore the super trees and did the sky walk linking the trees.
All in all well worth the money. We will definitely go here again on our next visit to Singapore.",,
,,Very touristic and crowded.,3,,Entry is not cheap (for tourists). It was packed during the weekend and felt more like an amusement park. The surrounding (and open) gardens are lovely and serene - but without A/C.,,
,,Beautiful,5,,A must-see in Singapore. Don't miss this tech-garden in the concrete jungle! The flower dome and cloud forest are one of a kind.,,
,,Ms. Yong,5,,"This is a very nice hotel in Singapore and the garden by the Bay is fantastic. 5* to MBS. Will stay in this hotel. Safe, classic, service all great. The Casino are great.",,
,,Awe-Inspiring Nature Park,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is a very large, colourful, futuristic park with Supertree structures that offer an impressive skywalk over the gardens and an elevated restaurant. There are over-sized climate controlled observatories/greenhouses, the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome, both with 鈥渉undreds鈥?of trees and plants to discover.

The park is dominated by 12 steel-framed Supertrees towering over the Gardens in the central area of the park. Apparently there are over 200 difference species of plants and flowers covering the exterior of these tall upright structures. Every night they form the centrepiece of the Gardens鈥?magnificent light and music show, a fairytale ending to a very enjoyable day.",,
,,Wouldn't go in the dark next time,4,,"I went in the evening and only had time to get a ticket to one site, they offer half price tickets late in the evening. We picked the flower dome which was lovely, but a little hard to see everything at night. It was actually quite dark in there. Enjoyed the sunflower display.",,
,,Garden by the bay.,5,,One of best and most interesting garden and park in Singapore. It has the nicest view and it has all the different plants and flower all around the world. The Supper tree and Dome are fantastic. All tourists should not miss this place.,,
,,Garden by the bay,5,,"Beautiful location, place where you feel you are amidst nature. Love the positive vibe of the place. Must visit place in Singapore.",,
,,Georgous gardens,5,,We went to the gardens at night when there was a music festival was on. It was all lit up and well worth a visit. Very popular so just be aware of large crowds of people.,,
,,Simply Stunning,5,,Absolutely fantastic place. You will love it. So much to look at and the evening light show is fabulous. You need some time to explore the the whole site as there is a lot to see. You can also eat there relatively cheaply compared to the city,,
,,Gorgeous!,5,,This was amazing and should not be missed! The light show is at 7ish every night and is incredible! Must see!!,,
,,Beautiful Lights & Flowers Display,5,,"Went during the Chinese Mid-Autumn Festival, where there in the Gardens, was a splendour of lights displayed. The Flower Dome had beautiful flowers displayed which was awesome. It was crowded inside the dome but didn鈥檛 feel too bad as the place was spacious enough.",,
,,Must visit in singapore,5,,"This place offers a unique indoor forest experience which you find at very few places.
There are two domes & both are unique in their own ways. & yes, they require time so take lots of time to visit & be prepared to walk a lot.",,
,,time your visit,5,,"Do the evening light show at the gardens (free to enter). After the Gardens light show, exit via the Bay Hotel, then await the start of the Bay Water Light/Music show. Two free shows in one evening, and both are spectacular.",,
,,Good place for evening walk for no cost.,4,,"Went with my elderly mum. It is a nice place to walk about in the evening, especially with the Supertrees performance. If you do not want to pay for entry into the dome, there are still areas you can enjoy in a cool evening. Just take mrt because parking is expensive and sometimes hard to get a parking space.",,
,,Vaccation,3,,"It's over rated , I did not feel that the plants were really real . The view was good . Not ready worth spending that money .",,
,,Serene,5,,We love visiting this place with our teenage Daughter and her friends. There is so much to see. Being close to nature. The sculptures the views. It just makes you feel so calm and peaceful.,,
,,Kind of disappointing,3,,"We paid $26 Singaporean dollars to do the tree too walk. Yes the view was breathtaking but the walk was very short. It was not what I expected based on other tree top walks I have been on however, if you haven鈥檛 been on others, this may be a good starting point. The children got bored very quickly and ran to the end.",,
,,What a nice experience,5,,It was nice a nice experience to spend an evening at this Fantastic place the gardens was beautiful And the show was amazing you can also enjoy eating and drinking at one of the resetaunt and coffees there.,,
,,Great experience don鈥檛 miss it,5,,"I鈥檓 not normally one to get keen on gardens, normally I鈥檇 be spending my time looking for something a bit more 鈥渆xciting鈥? but this is no normal garden!

The super trees are amazing, it鈥檚 worth the canopy walk to wander between the trees.

The free kiddies water park was great to give our young kids (4 and 2) something energetic to do of an hour or so. Be sure to take swimmers and a change of clothes for the kids and for Mum and Dad. There is a big undercover seating area at the water park.

This is unmissable when in Singapore",,
,,Great day out,5,,Fantastic views and combined ticket for both greenhouses and the skyway was great value. Surprised that it was not busier and no queuing when we went. Arrived around 1030 and spent over 3 hours visiting the paid for attractions. Excellent facilities and v friendly staff throughout the park.,,
,,Amazing,5,,Very good place for a walk in the afternoon. Please take time to check all the gardens. The sound and light show is scheduled everyday at 19:45 and 20:45.,,
,,Visit for the Supertree Grove,5,,"Took some of our best photos here. You can skip Flower Dome and Cloud Forest unless you're into gardening and flowers, but Supertree Grove (admission free) is highly recommended!

Alight at the Bayfront MRT station and follow the signs to Gardens by the Bay, which bring you first outside to an elevator and then to a footbridge.",,
,,Better than Tarzan - I walked through the treetops.,4,,Was a super view - yet maybe too quick an experience - walking at the high level of the Gardens by the Bay. These structures are most strange and definitely worth a visit up close. Good photo spot,,
,,Family holiday,4,,Garden by the bay very nicely maintained. So many variety if flowers and plants available. The water fall some is also very nice. The evening light and sound show is amazing. Overall nice place to visit in Singapore. Only you have to walk a lot.,,

,,Nice 馃檪,4,,I really loved my visit to the 2 domes. They are beautiful except that it was super crowded perhaps because I went on a Saturday.,,
,,Do not miss!,5,,Beautifully laid out gardens - do not miss the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome - they are stunning! And come back at night to see the light show from the Supertrees. What a jewel in Singapore's crown. The driverless vehicle that took us to the domes was a real treat.,,
,,Beautiful,4,,We went in the evening and was impressed by how beautiful the place was. Shame we didn鈥檛 get there a bit earlier as we didn鈥檛 get time to go into the greenhouses. Well worth a visit though.,,
,,Fantastic visit but very crowded,4,,Absolutely beautiful venue but the day we went it was very crowded (Sunday afternoon) . Staff handled the large numbers very well. Definitely worth a visit.,,
,,Fabulous viewing,5,,Magnificent 'mushrooms' in the sky and aerial walkways which lead you to the clouds make this a wonderland experience. A 'must-do' for any visitor.,,
,,Plenty to see & do!,5,,"We spent an afternoon here and covered both ""domes"", had a late lunch in the caf茅 (excellent!). Could easily have spent a full day here - main gardens etc are all free. Lightshows in the evening are supposed to be well worth a visit - I think they are 7.45 and 8.45 pm but not sure? Probably need to book if you want to eat at one of the main restaurants on site.",,
,,Don't Miss The Light Show!,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is, amazingly, free for anyone to wander. There's an excellent aerial view of Gardens by the Bay from atop Ce La Vi, but otherwise... make your way to the Supertree Grove for the light show! It's absolutely spectacular. The first show is at 7:45pm and the second is at 8:45pm, and each month the light show changes! Definitely a highlight of my time in Singapore.",,

,,Amazing park!,5,,"This amazing park has many attractions for children and adults. There are children's park where you can enjoy playing with water. Children will also be enthralled by the high waterfall in the Cloud Forest and the fascinating light show. Those who like plants and flowers will not be disappointed at the Flower Dome. There are numerous a ad-hoc attractions like the Mid Autumn Festival (lanterns galore), Singapore Garden Festivals, the ongoing ""Sunflower Suprise"" (with characters and scenes from Wizard of Oz), upcoming Supertree Grove Neon Jungle, etc. I'm eagerly waiting for Christmas Wonderland to start. Don't worry about getting lost in this big park. Just download the ""Gardens by the bay"" app. It will help you to navigate and learn more about the plants. There's also a shuttle for those less inclined to walk and wheelchair ramps for easier access.",,

,,Gardens by the way,5,,Got to see the waterfall garden and the garden dome which was neat because they show gardens from all over the world.,,
,,Amazing light show,5,,We were lucky enough to be walking the OCBC Skyway ($8 adults) during the nightly Garden Rhapsody. The music and light make for a truly memorable experience.,,
,,Light show,5,,"I really enjoyed the light show (and it is free). Suggest you get here when it is still light and walk around the gardens and then stay as the sun sets for the light show. If you can find a spot in a more elevated part of the gardens, you get a great view, probably better than underneath the trees.",,
,,Ok ok visit,4,,I don't liked much...as I am from India and have seen bigger gardens and better waterfall . For any other,,
,,Had organised a outing for a group of 90 participants on 23rd Sep 2018,4,,"Basically the experience were good for most of the participants. The staff were friendly and approachable. Main concern is that around 3pm, the whole place were fill and packed with visitors and this could be and issue if anyone wants to take a group photos at 3pm-4pm. After 430pm, somehow the crowd is back to normal.We had visited two domes and strongly recommend to spend more than 3 hours and do take some rest along the way.",,
,,"Amazing, spectaculr gardens - day and night",5,,"Wow, go at night and experience the amazing light show and gardens illuminated in beatiful colours. Just spectacular.",,

,,Excellent,5,,"A beautiful place to visit, exceptionally clean throughout,with some magnificent gardens from around the world. Very well signposted throughout, plenty of toilets for those in need. Very good pathways around the gardens. Very well kept. There are restaurants there where you can get food and drinks. For the less able, they have transport that can take people around. Access is simple from the MRT, or by bus or taxi.
Well worth a visit.",,
,,Must go,5,,"Great place to go if you visit Singapore, you have to at least go to the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome to experience the amazing structured indoor gardens and wonder how is it possible, well get amazed.",,
,,Loved the waterfall!,5,,Had a short time here but really found the entire place absolutely beautiful. Favourite part was definitely the worlds largest indoor waterfall!,,
,,Awesome,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is a nice respite from the Singapore heat and humidity. Each of the domes were pretty cool. The treetop walk is closed for maintenance on Mondays so if you plan on doing that, choose another day.",,
,,A nice place to visit,4,,"Beautifully arranged indoor garden and a forest. Nice flowers and foliage plants ( Flower Dome and Sky Forest ) in an air conditioned environment with the feeling that you are so close to the nature. A must visit place. Recommend to go their in the evening ( 4.00 pm) , so that you can admire the beauty of natural flowers and trees and also the beautify decorated artificial trees with colorful bulbs. Very relaxing place . Easy to reach there by MRT .",,
,,The Cloud Forest,5,,"We loved this experience, but thought the sister venue Flower Dome could have been missed out. It disappointed; really cheesy and out of keeping. Naturally many people love taking endless selfies beside figures from Wizard od Oz, but really left me bored.",,
,,Long waiting times,2,,"I recently visited the cloud forest for the third time last saturday but was very disappointed as the waiting times were upwards of 30 minutes and it was a huge waste of time for my family and I to be queueing. The last time i visited the cloud forest, a few months ago, the waiting times were still manageable and i only had to wait for 5-10 minutes at the most. I鈥檓 not sure what has changed, maybe it was more crowded than before but i also realised that previously i could have taken the staircase up to the top level and although it was quite a climb, it actually helped to cut down on the queue times. However, when i visited on saturday, i asked the staff but there was no stairs available for visitors to use, and i had to choice but to wait in line if i wanted to have a full experience of the cloud forest. I also had half to mind to just exit and be done with it. After the cloud forest, we went to visit the ocbc skyway however, the queue time was even more absurd, with the staff saying i has to queue up for more than a hour just to go up. If you鈥檙e in a rush, i recommend going to the botanic gardens instead! There are no waiting times and better yet, it鈥檚 free!",,
,,Amazing as always,5,,"Visited a few times before and the gardens still amaze me. They always have something new to show guests. The Flower Dome, Cloud Forest and OCBC Skyway are worth visiting.",,
,,Very interesting and lovely,5,,"We spent a half day here and loved it. Both the 鈥榗loud forest鈥?and the 鈥榝lower forest鈥?were terrific. It is unique in the way both forests were done - actually, very artistic, ingenious and easty to Navagate.",,
,,Beat the Heat,4,,"With such hot weather, a visit to the garden is a much needed treat. The whole dome is air conditioned so walking around is easy and relaxing. The variety of trees, cacti, shrubs, flowers delight the eyes specially for plant loving persons like me. I could also see a lot of photo enthusiast taking pictures of flowers up close. Although, the whole place is a huge photo wall with the plants as backdrop, the place may still be improved with a few more installations aside from the castle and pumpkin.. to make it more ""instagrammable"".

Stroller is available at minimum rental fee for toddlers. Elevator is also convenient for families with babies and seniors. Toilets are clean and big.",,
,,Amazing place,5,,"So incredible the best to see the show of lights, there are so many things to see inside and the price is not so expensive.",,
,,A Must Visit !,5,,What a wonderful experience this was. Believe me when i say that brochures and website pics do not do it justice. Went there with my wife and two kids and all four of us were completely blown away by how magnificent a place they have created. The flower dome is not to be missed if you are visiting this place. Even the the park itself was nothing short of beautiful. Sufficient amount of delicacies available at Satay by the bay. The new addition to the park is the Barrage By The Bay. Wonderful to walk up the barrage in the evening and sights of the distant Marina Bay Sands and the Singapore Wheel is truly spectacular.,,
,,Sunflower Surprise cum Mid Autumn Festival,5,,"It's really fantastic place to see lovely flowers whole year round. September this year, Garden by the Bay hosted sunflowers surprise with the Chinese lovely festival- Mid Autumn Festival. A total of 10,000 sunflowers together with the Theme, Wizard of Oz being presented in the Flower Dome. As for the Mid Autumn Festival, we get to see beautiful lanterns display in the nearby Dragonfly lake n Super Tree Grove. Looking forward to September 2019.",,
,,"Amazing place, an absolute must!",5,,"We visited at night, did the super grove sky walk about 745pm (joined the queue around 710pm, last entry 8pm) and witnessed the light show on the trees from there. Spectacular, felt like a private viewing. Amazing views of the city skyline. Watched the same one 1 hour later from the ground. Still great but not the same. Flower dome was nice, more so for the air con. A walk round the water area with the lights is cool also. You will spend about 2 hours here, busy in the evening but probably the best time to go. Pre booked tickets for both for a better deal, easy to pick up at the MBS hotel. A must visit",,
,,It鈥檚 just fascinating !,5,,I visited with my family & ended up spending the whole day at Gardens by the Bay. There鈥檚 just so much to see & soak in. Get your cameras or smartphones ready as you鈥檒l be spoilt for choice of the best views. It鈥檚 just amazing how a man made attraction can be so mesmerising. For nature lovers. You will not be disappointed.,,
,,Seeing the imagination come to fruition. Gardeners dream come true,5,,Don鈥檛 miss We took our time even though a lot of people were there. Never felt rushed. Flowers and plants I鈥檝e never seen but also fun naming the ones from my home state of Alabama,,
,,Amazing FREE light show!,5,,Definitely a big highlight of our trip to Singapore! The light show is so amazing it is a must see! I felt Singapore had so much to offer in the evening!,,
,,"Great by day , wow by night",4,,"Fantastic views whichever way you look, greenhouses are awesome. We didn鈥檛 get chance to get back at night but it looked dream from the GP circuit. Recommended",,
,,Relaxing walk through nature,4,,"While in itself a tourist destination, the Gardens weren鈥檛 exactly high on my to-visit list, but I gave in upon my friend鈥檚 insistence. The result: hours of chat and good-natured fun.",,
,,Beautiful!!,5,,"If you are in a singapore, then this place is a must! We went in the evening when they did the light show which was fantastic.",,
,,Supergrove Trees at night are the highlight,5,,"I visted Garden By the Bay on a Thursday evening visiting the flower room which included a cool Wizard of Oz based display, Cloud room and was lucky enough to catch by accident the night sound and light show with the Supergrove Trees which I hadn't previously known about. This was the highlight as the supergrove trees lit up changing colours with dome lovely music was a magic experience.",,
,,Fraud... Guys its a big pass.,1,,This is a bloody fraud... Seriously overrated. I believe people only above 60 years of age or botanists would enjoy this place. This is one of the most boring places in Singapore and not really worth the effort and time.This place is extremely crowded and claustrophobic. We got really bored over there and please don't take small children with you...its uncomfortable with them,,
,,Definitely recommend coming here,5,,"I love coming here, I come here every time I visit Singapore. I love just having a walk around the gardens or going into the flower or cloud dome. I would recommend coming here.",,
,,Life event!!,5,,"Absolutely amazing! We went for the whole day and evening. The 2 domes, the walkway and the little tram are chargeable. The rest is free. There are loads of places to eat but my favourite was all the little stalls that opened in the evening. Wish we'd been here on our first day rather than our last as we would have visited it more than once. Perfect for all age groups",,
,,Great day and night,4,,Had a great time both in the day and night. The view from up in the trees is spectacular and the lights at night are a must see.They are easy to get to and would go back again,,
,,Flower dome and cloud forest amazing.,5,,Thought both were amazing and different. The flower dome was perfectly presented and very interesting to walk around. The cloud forest was equally fantastic with the waterfall incredible. Arrived by MTR at Bayfront and walked across. A must do in Singapore.,,
,,Don't miss the show at night!,5,,"Entry to the gardens is free. I went to the gardens just before sunset, and I walked around admiring the gorgeously kept flora and man made artwork that pops up in several places. Marina Bay Sands is also on full view here. There is Satay by the Bay within the grounds where I enjoyed some satay, before returning to the Supertree Grove to watch the evening light show, which was spectacular. Highly recommended for anyone going to Singapore on any good weather day.",,
,,Lovely day in the garden,4,,A really enjoyable day spent amongst the flowers. Well worth visiting the domes and the elevated walk way. Recommended a little expensive if on a budget.,,
,,Day trip,5,,"The Garden鈥檚 By The Bay are incredible. So much care and attention has been taken into making sure the plants at well looked after. It鈥檚 a must see, great for all ages.",,
,,Absolutely amazing,5,,Spellbound by the dome displays. Light show in the evening was fantastic. Allow a few hours to do it justice.,,
,,gardens by the bay,5,,A must see allow yourself plenty of time the displays are amazing.Going on a tour didn't give us enough time to really enjoy the whole experience.,,
,,Gorgeous,5,,"This garden is an awesome symbol for Singapore's image as a garden city. Furthermore, a large part of the place is free admission.",,
,,Amazing,5,,"The gardens themselves are beautiful to wander around. It was a bit busy but there are some good view points around. The super trees are great to see from near and far! The Garden Rhapsody in the evening is a must see, just take a blanket because some of the raised areas get taken quickly. If you want to see the show from skywalk tickets stop being sold and access prevented after 8pm (which isn鈥檛 stated on the website).",,
,,Fun for grown ups,4,,"Good for grown ups not so much for the kids. Best to do outdoors first before it gets too hot, then head to the domes for some air con. Their was a wizard of oz display kids enjoyed as well as the waterfall. Beautifully done, refreshing and serene.",,
,,Brilliant,5,,"Brilliant. I can鈥檛 say a bad thing about this place. Loads to see and do here, beautiful area with so many different things to capture on camera. So so clean too and a lot of places to eat. The light show (at 7:45pm) was brilliant also. Would come back to Singapore just to go back.",,
,,Spectacular,5,,"The gardens by the bay represent what Singapore does best which is look forward at where they want to be then plan and execute. Go in the evening for the light show which we all loved, capped off a great trip to Singapore.",,
,,Visit,5,,"We were only in Singapore for two full days with a lot of places to explore, this was one of the must see attractions especially when lit up at night and not a huge expense.",,
,,Short break,4,,"Very good, worth visiting. Very high tech and excellent architecture. Will suggest to visit. We had transportation arranged by our tour operator",,
,,Supertri show,5,,"I stayed in my memory. I lay down and watched a great show with a song. It's a memorable place. If I visit again, I will go there again.",,
,,A Cool Break,5,,Recommend visiting the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest during the hotter parts of the day. Beautiful places to explore in a cool climate controlled environment. Even if gardening isn鈥檛 your thing definitely worth the visit. The lights shows at night are also worth checking out. All produced with the important message on environmental sustainability,,
,,Ideal Place to take wonderful photos / selfies,4,,"Had a great day 1st week September here. Visited Flower Dome - a giant air-conditioned glass greenhouse and Cloud Forest. Reached 2pm. Can see the place getting crowded by 4pm. Had lunch at Satay by the Bay which had so many local dishes at affordable prices. If i visit again, I will aim to reach around 11am so as to avoid the crowds.",,
,,Unhelpful Assistance from the Security Officer,1,,"I plan to visit the garden and wazed it over. Waze led us to Marina East. We stopoed by and asked the security officer (about 9.30pm) on how to get to Gardens by the Bay, he told us to park at the East Bay Parking and walked over. They claimed that it is just a short walk. We do as what they suggested, but ended up walking for 1.5 hours to get there, arriving about 11pm with no one around (no food stalls too). We ended up needed to grab a Grab to travel back to where we drop our car. Even the Grab driver also got surprised with what we gone through, he too enlight us with a possibility that we were pranked as they see that we are driving a Malaysia car.

This is certainly improper for a frontliner to provide misleading information to the customers/visitors.",,
,,A Fantastic Visual Experience,5,,"This is a must visit if you are in Singapore. The magnitude and beauty of the entire project in the gardens by the bay is like nothing I have ever seen before. The cloud forest and the flower dome are particularly stunning, well worth the extra money to visit these.",,
,,Amazing,5,,This is a really cool attraction in Singapore. The super trees are beautiful both in the day and at night and worth seeing especially as they are free. We actually enjoyed these more then the paid admission areas and would highly recommend seeing them. If you can watch the evening light show as it is pretty special. We didnt get time to do the skyway as the wait was over an hour which wasnt feasible with a 1 year old,,
,,Very cool,5,,"Interesting, informative and worth while. This whole area of Singapore is amazing, we had a wonderful time exploring the wonders of the gardens. Do yourselves a favour, a must when you visit.",,
,,Fantastic place and so worth a visit.,5,,Theres so much to see and do but this should not be missed. We went early afternoon. It was very hot but very quiet.,,
,,Must see in Singapore,5,,"This is simply a must-see in Singapore, don't overthink it - just go and discover for yourself. This place is unique.",,
,,Visited several times on this trip,4,,"Loved the design. But I loved the smaller elements more. The sculptural trees are so famous but after a while you start to notices how beautifully it is designed. Loved that it has trees and plants from all over the world. Loved the Malay, Indian and Chinese gardens. The frangipani was just coming into blossom. There has been a festival earlier in the week which was so showy. Go early. Go often",,
,,Must see,5,,"The garden is situated opposite to Marina Bay Sands with MRT. The two conservatives are spectacular for its design and plant species. You can spend the whole day inside without bored. The chinese restaurant at the entries of the two conservatives has very good offer, both price and food quality. The light show is interesting. However, it is too crowded the day I went. The wood bridge swing left and right, unusual movement for such structure, when full of people scared me. Wortyh going but should avoid weekend.",,
,,Really cool!,4,,"We went one evening so we could do the skywalk while it was light out and then the sunset so we could see it at night. The trees are so cool, and funky. We went during the mid-autumn festival so it was very crowded. I hope to go back to go to the Flower Dome.",,
,,Different Experience,5,,"Singaporeans have created an awesome place to experience the Mediterranean or cool climes climatic condition with their endemic foliage. These climes can be naturally experience at the center hill area in Sri Lanka as well. But in Singapore, you can experience same. but only disadvantage is you can't see the animals and Birds there as in Sri Lanka. Other than that beautiful place to visit without forgetting.",,
,,Wow!!!,5,,This place is amazing - don't miss the show that commences at 7:45pm. It is impressive and better still free!! I was in awe.,,
,,Very crowded weekends and it closes early.,4,,"I came here on a weekend for a special flower exhibition that was displayed in the Flower dome. Both exhibitions are built with aircon that is great for Singapore's humid weather. Unfortunately, the weekends are filled with both tourist and the local people. Recommended to go on the weekdays to avoid the crowd.",,
,,Beauty and Ever amazing,5,,"Irregardless the number of times that I have been to the Flower Dome, it never fails to amaze me with the great effort to put up a different and refreshing look each time. The staff are friendly and getting more professional as well. Keep it up!",,
,,Gardens by the bay.,5,,"Fantastic experience, amazing technology. Well worth a visit and the audio tour was brilliant. Plenty to do and see.",,
,,"Beautiful, detailed and informative",5,,"Detailed, planned and thoughtful planting. Informative and educational displays. My only personal negative would be my disappointment after leaving the domes, with their information on climate change, habitat destruction and pollution, to be immediately faced with the disposable plastic filled snack shop! There were some recycling bins around the gardens but they were fewer and further between than waste bins. Much more could be done to make this wonderful attraction more environmentally friendly, and to practise what they preach!",,
,,MESMERIZING!,5,,Worth the MONEY and adventure! If you would like to skip the long queue in the ticket booths. I highly recommend to buy the tickets online and provide the voucher so you can enter directly without wasting time in the ticket booths. BRING a TRIPOD!,,
,,Magical,5,,"A must for anyone visiting Singapore and you won鈥檛 be disappointed. The gardens are amazing by day and night. If you can make the nighttime show, it鈥檚 definitely worth it.",,
,,Very beautiful,5,,"If you enjoy plants, flowers and nature, this was a wonderful garden to view and spend a few leisurely hours walking around and enjoying the sights.",,
,,Fantastic flora,5,,"TodayI visited 鈥淕ardens by the Bay鈥?for the 2nd time this week. The first time I just walked around the area during the day to see the area and what it was all about. However, today I experienced the area by going into 鈥楾he Cloud Forest鈥?and it was amazing! I was in awe of the waterfall, the variety of plants and flowers. I felt like I was transported into a jungle in a prehistoric era. The temperature inside the dome was cool and a great escape from the Singaporean humidity. The journey through this 鈥楲ost World鈥?took about an hour- but if you are a flower fan you may want to spend longer. The admission for just the cloud forest was S$16.

After my tour around the cloud forest, I happened to be in time for the 鈥楪arden Rhapsody鈥?which is a beautiful light and music show that takes place in the Supertree Grove. The performance went for about 25-35 minutes and beautifully showed off the trees and was a delight to watch. The cost for concert/ lights how was free and they do the performance twice- one at 19.45 and at 20.45.",,
,,Worth the visit,4,,"A bit of a walk from MRT station or you may purchase tix and ride on the bus. Tix queues are long, best to purchase in advance via klook. Both attractions are great but crowded. Half a day to cover the area.",,
,,Amazing!!!,5,,The most spectacular show you will ever see!! You MUST go there when the sun goes down and see the show with the lights from the ground. It's an amazing experience!!Do not miss that!,,
,,Magical,5,,"Went at sunset, sat on a grassed area behind the Supertree Grove and watched the trees light up to music with food and drinks from the street food stalls with Marina Bay Sands in background - iconic Singapore!",,
,,Okay place.,3,,We visited gardens by the bay on a Saturday evening. Reached there by 5 p.m. tickets at counter we're 28$ a piece. We got ours from an agent in Chinatown for 16. You have to walk a lot . The cloud forest and flower park are good but only one time visit. The light show at the end is good.choose a place wisely to see the trees light,,
,,Fantastic!,5,,"With a few hours to spare while traveling on business, this was a nice stop to stretch my legs and explore the gardens. It鈥檚 free to explore outdoors, but there is a reasonable fee to visit the conservatories. This could easily be a day trip, but was worth the money just for the short time spent walking through the enclosures. A highlight of Singapore.",,
,,陌nteresting,4,,"Such a relaxing area right next to the hustle of the city. The evening sound and light show is a must, so magical. Can't think of a Singapore visit without experiencing this area.",,
,,Gorgeous gardens by the bay,5,,Always wanted to visit and made a date during the Grand Prix weekend. It is beautiful from when you walk in. There is transport available for a few dollars by buggy if required for a small fee. The planning of the gardens is amazing. Two beautiful greenhouses with various displays. Fantastic treehouse experience which you can experience great views. took hundreds of photos and so much to see. Would recommend late afternoon before dark as then the gardens become a wonderland. Will be back again soon.,,
,,Gardens by the Bay: Flower Dome,4,,"So good that my babes both fell asleep 15 minutes into the walk. It is relaxing, no doubt. Ventilation is awesome. The sunflower display was disappointing, but the orchid and Sakura exhibitions were enchanting <3",,
,,Nice place,5,,"Was here with a bunch of friends, visited both of the dorm. Must come if you are into interesting flowers, and nice decorations as well. Estimate to spend 2 hours here and may come on a hot day as it is cooling inside the dorm.",,
,,Nice relaxing Sunday,4,,My co-workers and I were in Singapore on business. We came in a day early to time zone acclimate. We spent part of our day at the Gardens by the Bay. It was beautiful and relaxing. Very laid back and interesting.,,
,,Beautiful,4,,This is so different and so beautiful. You do the visit inside and outside. Everything is great. This is a must,,
,,Great spot to visit,5,,Took 20min guided tour on arrival in electric car great way to orientate yourself to the area. Visited the flower house and rainforest house. Both well laid out and well done huge variety of orchids etc plus impressive waterfalls,,
,,One of the wonders of the modern world - Fantastic,5,,By far the best show we have ever seen around the world. The evening performance unbelievable. *****,,
,,"Stunning gardens, lots to see, great views.",5,,Well worth the walk through these free gardens. Allow a few hours so you can go to both domes as well as have a stroll.,,
,,Paradise in a Glass Box,5,,One of the star attraction of the City. Best is the sound and light show in the evening. The children parks closes to soon. it needs to be open for longer.,,
,,Magical Atmosphere,5,,"The Gardens by the bay is the best place to visit in Singapore, with no doubt.
It creates a magical atmosphere: it seems to be in a movie!
After the sunset, at about 7:30 PM, the supertrees take life in an emotional light and music show.
Do not miss it !",,
,,"Enjoyed the flowers, cool air and the night lights.",4,,"Loved visiting Gardens by the Bay. If you love flowers - that's the place to be. Cool air, nice walkways and at night there's a free night show.",,
,,Great for the family,5,,"Went with my family and grandmother, best to go a few hours before sundown to catch the super trees at night then head to",,
,,Cool,4,,"We were there on a Sunday at 19.30 pm, at 19.45 a show started with music and lights. Don't know if this is every day. Free to see from the ground, long line to the Skywalk.",,
,,A definite MUST,5,,We loved our visit here. It is a must - both domes and the Skywalk. Hubby isn鈥檛 into gardening and he said he would love to go back!,,
,,Absolutely stunning an amazing place,5,,"Gardens By The Bay was my main reason for visiting Singapore and after a 15 hour flight I was wondering if it would be worth it and it most certainly was. No photo can do justice to how wonderful this place is.
You can walk around the park for free and see the Supertrees up close. You pay to visit the Cloud Dome, Forest Dome and Skywalk.
The domes are amazing, there is so much to see. At the time of our visit there was a Wizard of Oz display with every variety of Sunflower, I always thought a Sunflower was a Sunflower, I didn't realise there were so many varieties.
I was expecting the temperature in the domes to be hot and humid but they are cool.
There was an Autumn Festival with Chinese decorations which looked brilliant at night when they were all lit up.
We went back in the evening to watch the light show which again was brilliant.

If you're visiting Singapore this is one place you have to go.",,
,,Incredible structures and roof top experience,4,,"This is an amazing space across indoor and outdoor options. The Flower Dome was a bit strange with the false flowers and blow up vegetables, but the Cloud Forrest was surreal but the Supertree Grove was incredible. The tall structures reaching out of the ground were amazing enough during the day but at night! Wow! the light show was spectacular! We also headed up to the rooftop bar at the top fo the largest Supertree for sunset. A must do! for a $20 entrance fee, one beer included, its the perfect place to see the sun setting on the incredible Marina Bay Sands and out into the harbour. We'll be back!",,
,,Over crowded at weekend - 1 hr Queue to get on top of dome.,1,,What used to be a pleasant attraction has become a mass tourism disaster to avoid at all cost if you do not want to face over crowded place,,
,,Beautiful,5,,Really liked this place and we are far from horticulturists. The displays were beautiful and felt as though you were taken to a different place. The light show around the super trees was quite magical.,,
,,Beautiful!,5,,"Absolutely stunning. We had a bridal party photoshoot there. Also GBTB is where my fianc茅 proposed, so it is only apt.",,
,,Stunning,5,,This was a surprising delight. The tall trees are fascinating and beautiful and the cafe serves fantastic food. Spend a day!,,
,,Catch up with good friend at beautiful garden,4,,Both my friend (friend of Garden by the Bay)and myself love flowers and we were so happy to see giant sunflowers smiling at us馃槉,,
,,Gardens by the Bay,4,,"Amazing man made beauty. The light show was fabulous and the area is a nice package with Marina bay, the Marina Mall and gardens by the bay.",,
,,Nature - Amazing,5,,"Amazing gardens and very well maintained. The Cloud Dome being my favourite! Conserving nature. Some tourists did not understand the sign that stated 'Do not Touch the flowers', and I had to tell them not to pluck / touch these!",,
,,So beautiful,5,,Definitely worth going even if you don't pay for the Cloud Forest. The grounds are beautiful and so well-maintained.,,
,,my friends have very nice experiences there. They think the two domes are thr best places to visit in singapore,4,,beautiful scene. good for photo shots and cool to stay inside. wish to have more poster to explain the flowers instead of getting the audio guide,,
,,A must to visit when in Singapore,5,,This is a very unique place to visit. We went during the morning when it was a bit cooler but I believe it is fantastic to see when the lights are on at night.,,
,,Lovely flowers,5,,Nice display of sunflowers in a beautiful and neat environment. Would visit again for other flowers display.,,
,,Worth $$,5,,Went to GBTB with my mum. She was so excited with all the flowers/ cactus. Definitely will come back!,,
,,Evening visit,4,,Quick visit for the evening light and music show. Really pleasant place to be and light show is quite magical and great setting next to Marina Bay Sands hotel.,,
,,Best place in Singapore,5,,Amazing place. Suggested to go around 4-5 in the afternoon in order to saw the gardn at day time and at night time when the light experience is amazing,,
,,Worth a day's visit,5,,"There are many things that are must-see when in Singapore, and this is no exception. The solar-powered 'supertrees' are futuristic (think Avatar) in line with the country's forward thinking to be a smart city. The two domes are well worth visiting as well, although not as impressive as the supertrees. Best to go in the evening when it's not so hot and you can see the lights come on at twilight.",,
,,"Amazing beautiful place, a must visit if able to walk around a bit.",5,,"We visited twice, in the evening for the second light show at 8.45pm, free entry. Stunning light desplay in the giant trees and lots lit up. Plenty to see. We ate at satay by the bay after, an open food market, lovely cheap food and drink.
We went back the next day to look in the flower dome and the cloud forest. Good value as so much to see, we spent about an hour in each. Got our tickets on line. Walked there, but used the shuttle back to MRT station.
Well worth a visit.",,
,,An ordinary attraction,3,,"Would be more eager to have visited a zoo. This place is beautiful but it doesn't excite you at any point of the trip. I haven't chosen a ticket to climb up the light trees, maybe you can enjoy the view on there but the domes were not shockingly nice.",,
,,Beautiful!,5,,"Totally recommend everyone do this. So glad we went. Thoroughly enjoyed every moment. So easy to get there on the MRT. The tree top walk is also recommended, beautiful views from up there and $15 is quite reasonable.",,
,,Nice to see,5,,I didn鈥檛 go inside. You have to pay for entrance. But from the outside its already fantastic to see. A relaxing place.,,
,,nice for a short vissit,4,,"nice to walk around in the gardens, free of charge. Entering the flower garden is not free. Popular among locals and tourists, just outside Marina Bay Sands, with easy access via the subway",,
,,Superb beauty,5,,It鈥檚 fantastic experience. Beautiful place to enjoy an evening. Colour combination and changing colours is an unique feature.,,
,,Incredible!,5,,Very beautiful gardens and the man made trees light up in different colours which looks incredible lit up at night. I think the photos speak for themselves.,,
,,What a sight to see!,5,,"Gardens are absolutely magical. Although, popular, the park is not too crowded, and great for an evening stroll with friends.",,
,,Marvelous place,5,,Heaven Really i felt luckiest person visit garden by the bay! I keep on promote to my family & friends,,
,,Beautiful,4,,The gardens are just beautiful. You do have to walk a bit to get to the trees so wear comfy shoes. Bring a selfie stick too as you will take a lot of pictures,,
,,Worth a Visit,5,,"We could see these from our hotel, at night they are wonderfully lit up. We had an very enjoyable time visiting them and certainly recommend the experience.",,
,,Nucw Gardens,4,,Very well kept gardens with lots of different spieces. You can see wide range of flowers and plants. Excellent place to spend afternoon with children.,,
,,Light show,4,,"I visited this place in the morning, afternoon and evening. Did the sky walk. Best time to visit is the evening with the lights on. Don't miss the light show.",,
,,ABSOLUTELY STUNNING,5,,"If you鈥檙e into greenery and botanical things, this is the spot for you! There were two domes to check out, the cloud forest and the flower dome. Both were honestly stunning. I鈥檝e never seen anything like it before.",,
,,One of the many wonders of Singapore,5,,Never ceases to amaze me the lush greenery and modern technology combined to give us the Gardens. A place for all.,,
,,Amazing Attraction,5,,This place will bow you away and you'll walk away stoked that you took in this attraction. Definitely one of Singapore's main highlights!,,
,,Beautiful indoor garden!,5,,A beautiful display of flowers and plants! Singapore is truly extraordinary in how it's able to do the impossible: it literally has an indoor waterfall! A gorgeous way to spend the afternoon. We loved the displays and the museum exhibit on climate change. Make sure to see the beautiful flower exhibit and the waterfall!,,
,,Never to be forgotten experience,5,,Out of this world experience. If you ever go to Singapore don't miss this. It happens twice every evening .make your way to the super trees and find a place to sit ( or lay) on the grass and wait to be amazed.,,
,,Great place to visit,5,,"We decided to visit so we could be indoors during the rainy day, knowing we had the option to walk around the outside gardens if the weather broke, it didn鈥檛 but to be honest we spent a few hours in the two in door domes, great loved it, feels rather chilly as you enter, but you soon get acclimatised, also after we finished we walked back to marina bay sands shopping mall and had a lunch in the food court which was reasonable price for Singapore, and following that a very convenient taxi stand to go back to our hotel for an afternoon nap, a good day out and a change from shopping on orchard road",,
,,Gardens by the Bay - must visit attraction,5,,The Gardens by the Bay are an incredible attraction that was enjoyed by various ages in our group. It is a free attraction in Singapore and certainly highly recommended. The light display each evening and accompanying music through the gardens was amazing to see. The timing and accentuated colours reflecting the mood of the music was very enjoyable. We were only sorry that we could not have gone back for a second visit during our time in Singapore.,,
,,Beautiful,5,,The gardens are beautiful. Unfortunately for us we went during the morning in April. Step out of the taxi and straight away the heat hits you. I recommend going at night. My children got frustrated with the heat quite fast. It is a long walk for little ones as well.,,
,,Well worth the visit to Singapore a must do..,5,,"I loved visiting the gardens even though they were renovating lots of the areas which was a shame. It is well worth the trip, it's a must visit in a life time. You must go late afternoon early evening so you can she the difference in lighting. There are areas where you are able to top up your water bottle especially when its hot.",,
,,Beautiful and Amazing Garden,5,,This is an amazing place to cool down from the scorching sun of Singapore. Beautiful plant flowers and trees of different spieces can be viewed from clean paths. A recommended place to visit.,,
,,The most incredible gardens I have ever visited,5,,"This place is incredible and should be on anyone鈥檚 list when visiting Singapore .

The gardens are huge and lovely to walk around but it is the cleverness of the design and the way things are displayed that set this apart from other gardens beautiful huge sculptures ants / dragonfly etc.

The super trees are beautiful at night

The temperature controlled domes are fascinating and interesting with displays of plantsfrom all around the world. We only had 4.5 hours here and did not see it all. We will visit again but this time we will spend a day here.",,
,,One of the worthy sites of Singapore,5,,"The work that has gone into this is a lot, and it combines well done design with common appeal and is done with regard to the comfortable climate inside.

Although focused on plants, it is done in an appealing and attractive way to keep most interested. Nobody around seemed bored and it was well worth the cost. Nice to see good design that caters well for its guests!",,
,,Beautiful place,5,,Stunning gardens with innovative use of technology. The super trees are amazing. The whole place is incredibly tidy and fee of litter (like all of Singapore). Staff were helpful and polite.,,
,,Amazing,5,,"If you look for a cool place where you can also cool down, this is the place to go. Since locals want to see how things are in e.g. Europe, they have the European climate = nice cool.....",,
,,Pristine,5,,This place is just amazing. The plants and trees and water features are beautiful. The gardens are so neat and tidy paths clean and signage is very good. Went back at night for the light show. This was the highlight of our trip. Just wonderful.,,
,,Gardens by the Bay (At Night),5,,This is such a beautiful creation. I strongly recommend visiting at night (after 7pm). The light shows are truly spectacular! You can usually find tour packages that combine this with MBS observation deck and river cruise. Believe me...it's worth!,,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,"Easy to get to either on foot or via the SG MRT. Plenty of free activities, entry to Cloud Forest & Flower garden domes is around S$25.
A nice relaxing visit, even when busy you do not feel over crowded. Easy to navigate around the site lots of exotic displays.",,
,,Awesome! highly recommend to be your first stop in Singapore!,5,,"Really really loved this place! We had a great time! It was hot but we enjoyed the big conservatories. The super trees are really awesome. This is ecotourism at its best! If you only have one day in singapore, come here!",,
,,Indoor Wonderland!,5,,"An amazing piece of architecture, combined with a creative nature flair! Great place for the whole family, young or mature! A must see when visiting Singapore!",,
,,Spectacular International plants and flowers,5,,"This is a disabled friendly attraction where wheelchairs and scooters are easily able to view all exhibits. It is a must see for all visitors to Singapore and features tree, plant and flower displays from a vast range of countries.Very educational and the Cloud Forest is an amazing domed structure with plants and flowers you probably would never see anywhere else. Allow lots of time to roam around and relax on the seats provided at various points. It is also a short walk away from the Marina Bay precinct for restaurants, cafes and the Marina Bay Sands resort.",,
,,Amazing!,5,,"Absolutely loved it. Free entry into the Gardens. Highly recommend the Cloud Forest conservatory - amazing climates controlled environment - literally a mountaintop garden and waterfalls in a glass dome.
The OCBC Skywalk is a must if you are there for Rhadphody in the Gardens (was on at 8.00 pm and 9.00 pm). Magical night show among the installations aligned to music. Even if you can鈥檛 get onto the Skywalk stay and watch the show from the ground.
Very easy to get to - right by Marina Bay Sands - and local MRT station.",,
,,Unusual but beautiful,5,,We happened upon the Gardens by the bay on our last morning. It was a bit rainy so the sky walk was shut but the gardens themselves were interesting and the tree shaped towers of plants were incredible. You could wander around them for free and only had to pay for the undercover areas. We didn't get time to visit these but would certainly recommend the free areas.,,
,,Day out.,4,,Could easily spend a day here. Maybe not if you are a teenager ! The domes are actually cooler than being outside. Stick around to see the light show in the supergrove in the evening.,,
,,Night time here is amazing,5,,"Gardens by the bay is an amazing place to spend a day. The water park is perfect for little ones. The domes are fantastic, perfect on a hot day. At night time it is another level. The lights create a level of ambience which makes evenings here something you don鈥檛 want to miss.",,
,,Go back at night.,5,,As you鈥檇 expect from a major tourist attraction it was busy - but worth it. Get your hand stamped and go back to the cloud Dome at night. Far prettier.,,
,,Well worth a visit,5,,"Gardens by the bay offers free admission to walk around the impressive gardens with the immaculate floral and lantern displays. The lantern displays are of course much better when night falls where they can be viewed in all their glory. So if you're a visitor to Singapore, to get the best out of the attraction, I suggest going an hour before sunset to get the day and night aspects. There are outlets where you can get a quick bite to eat and drink, or go for a sit down meal in the good selection of restaurants. There are two huge bio domes that charge an entrance fee, so you can choose to go in just one or purchase a ticket for the two. You'll need about a couple of hours to do both domes. We paid $28 each for both, so it's a little bit pricey, a bit too much I think.
Glad we went though and well worth the visit. If you're going by MRT, it's Bayfront you want and it takes you straight into the gardens.",,
,,Nice to visit,4,,"We did both of the glass domes and the elevated gardens, one dome is called the Cloud Forest and the other the Flower Dome, we personally preferred cloud forest as it has walkaways elevated so you can look down over all the flowers and the waterfall. The other one was still pretty and had some beautiful plants but it was a lot smaller, seems bigger when looking at it but it has a function room inside it. It will be busy, as with any tourist attraction, you do feel like you have to duck underneath people taking photographs at every step, I suggest going later as it will be quieter, which is what we did with Cloud Forest. The elevated gardens are beautiful for a stunning view over Singapore. However do note: they will close it off if a storm is due, we sat around for an hour waiting for said storm to never appear, but I understand they need to keep guests safe. When we eventually got up there you walk along and can see spectacular views, it feels narrow at points so not for the faint hearted or those afraid of heights. Otherwise it鈥檚 definitely worth a visit but it is a tourist hotspot so there could be lengthy queues.",,
,,Stunning!,5,,"We visited the gardens recently and have to say it鈥檚 a must see!
Attention to detail, well maintained, super clean and just everything I wanted to see from beautiful plants to shrubs and trees that are so beautiful.
Loved every minute of exploring these stunning gardens.",,
,,It鈥檚 awesome,4,,View is very nice . Me n my family they really enjoy the view and we click many pics. Well maintained. Got stalls for drinks as well.,,
,,Gardens,4,,Well worth a visit. Most spectacular. A little expensive and the tram needs more stops so that you can get on and off all around the gardens.,,
,,Excellent experience,5,,"Loved the musical rhapsody of lights in the Gardens. Breathtaking and awesome. A must visit, definitely. Visit the bar at Indochina for the night view. $20 for a drink to enjoy the lovely view. Just magnificent.",,
,,Amazing,5,,A wonderful few hours spent here prior to the F1. It was very hot but there were plenty of watering holes along the way. A truly beautiful place,,
,,Impressive,4,,Enjoyable half day out. Very interesting concept and well executed. Nice and cool inside the biodomes. A bit pricey but that's true of everything in Singapore. The sort of attraction that you would visit once but probably wouldn't go back again,,
,,Huge garden with many attraction,4,,"Gardens by the bay is a city garden in Singapore which offer many attractions inside.

How to get here?
Choose Bayfront MRT station as your destination (same destination with Marina Bay Sands). It was a clear direction in the exit. So you can easily find the way to get here.
Personally, I recommend you to use shuttle service which takes
SGD 3 per passenger (no fee for my 2 y.o child). Because it will be so hard to to walk in the sunny day by bringing stroller. It also needs more than 15 mins walking. So, shuttle service is the best way. But if you have long time to explore each spot of the Garden by The Bay, it's not a bad choice to walk.

What can be seen here?
Gardens by the bay has several attractions inside :
-Flower dome (indoor flower garden)
-Cloud forest (indoor conservatory with artificial waterfall)
-OCBC skyway (walkway with 22 metres high)
-Supertree grove (huge artificial tree)
-Far east organization (garden for children with water fountain)
-Etc

The most favourite attractions are flower dome and cloud forest

鈽?When is the best time to go here?
If you want to go to indoor conservatory, go in the morning. If you want to see light attractions in supertree, go in the dusk.

What is the best outfit?
Wear an outift which comfort you. Casual is the suitable outfit. Because again, you need to walk more here.

Admission
Depend on the attraction that you choose. Usually, visitor come to flower dome and cloud forest which take SGD 28/adult

Opening hours
9 am - 9 pm daily",,
,,amazing,5,,amazing place will definitely come again the rain forest was absolutely amazing the flower one a bit lame though love the rest though staff where very helpful,,
,,Go at the night time.,5,,All are created artificially. Trees and everything. But i think paying for the flower dome and visiting is not worth. But you should try cloud forest. Beautiful scenery at night time. We enjoyed 7.45 pm night time light festival. It lasted only for just 15 min,,
,,Loved it,5,,The staff were great and the price was not to bad for what it was I would definitely recommend this to anyone I know,,
,,A delight,5,,"Gardens by the bay is a must see. It鈥檚 charming and beautiful. The attractions speak to all age groups. There are places to eat. The toilets are clean. The staff are very helpful. It is lovely by day and by night. Each has its own charm. Even if you just have a day, it鈥檚 a must see.",,
,,Futureland is here,5,,Feels a lot like a 1950s Expo but it is real. Cloud Forest is well worth the visit and the whole place is beautiful in the day but especially at night.,,
,,The light show is worth a visit,4,,I haven鈥檛 found anything exceptional about this tourist attraction but most of it is free to access so no complaints! The evening light and music show is worth going to though. Again it鈥檚 free. Get there early and pick a spot under one of the structures where you can lay down on your back and look up to the 鈥渂ranches鈥? The show lasts about 15 minutes and is thoroughly enjoyable.,,
,,Garden By The Bay,5,,Nice place to hang out with friends or family Get ready with photo shoot all the unique and awesome view,,
,,Worth a look,4,,"So the Cloud Forest is the one of the 2 you will spend the most time at (when you buy your tickets for both it's cheaper), having said that on this occasion the theme was sunflowers and the effort put into the displays made for an enjoyable 45min or so for our group of with ages from early 30's to late 60's.

Anyone with a passion for botanics will easily spend 4+ hours here.",,
,,Amazing,5,,"Well worth an evening visit. The light show is wonderful, as are all of the other light displays in the gardens. Make a point of eating at satay by the bay while you鈥檙e there.",,
,,Awesome place,5,,This place is an architectural marvel. You can't miss it in Singapore. This place is full of life. You can spend a very relaxed evening here. Great place for family with small kid. There are nice cafes nearby where you can sip some exotic coffees.,,
,,Walked round but didn鈥檛 go into the ticketed area,4,,"We walked round the gardens and chose not to purchase a ticket to go into the paid attractions as we only had an hour or two. We got to see the immaculate gardens and displays around the bay which was enough for us. We walked along the bay side and saw a turtle in the bay. No otters though disappointingly.

Worth a visit and saved something for next time we visit.",,
,,Must See - Value For Money,5,,"This was a highlight of Singapore we hadn't expected.
Two adults @ $Sg28 each, seemed pretty good value for what turned out to be a relaxing and amazing 2plus hours wandering around amongst an amazing feat of engineering and gardening. Compared to higher priced experiences in Singapore, this was a 'steal'.
An amazing assemblage of really healthy plants from all around the world displayed through a logical labyrinth of pathways that provide extraordinary vistas of plants..All under the one amazing glass roof.
If the first conservatory was amazing, the second hosting a rainforest is awesome. Dominated by a 6-storey waterfall, you are delivered by lift to the top and allowed to walk down the spiral of walkways to see different spectacular greenery around a central mountain.
The bonus in both conservatories is that it is significantly cooler than the 30 degrees outside. A nice relief.
Plenty of people, including lots of school groups.
Everything well done, and staff strategically positioned and very friendly.
I'd go again, and take friends..",,
,,Must visit for travellers,5,,"It is a great place to visit for nature lovers. Beautiful gardens, flowers and rain forest. Can do in 2 hours to 5 hours depending on how much you read all the displayed items. It freshens you from all the tiredness of travelling. Great place to learn what we can do to save global warming.",,
,,Amazing,5,,The gardens were unbelievably amazing!! The price is totally worth it to go. Each garden was unique and had its own touch. Very beautiful flowers and flora. Highly recommend!,,
,,Very interesting over all.,5,,"Good for young children activity, study tour, pleasure for anyone, relaxing and enjoy the beauty of the garden alone and the light.",,
,,Fantastic place for a day out best in early evening .,5,,Fab flower and cloud domes spent hours inside looking at exhibits. Park is large and very well laid out. The giant trees are amazing and the sky walk a real treat. Go at dusk to see it all ligh5 up,,
,,Excellent Gardens,5,,"Really enjoyed our afternoon at the Gardens. We visited both domes but the skywalk was closed. We really enjoyed the domes and the displays were interesting and beautiful.
We had coffee and cake at the caf茅 by the domes which was lovely and if you showed your dome ticket you got a $5 discount

The lantern display was on which was fantastic to see.
Would recommend a visit here, even if you didnt want to pay to see the displays in the domes the actual outside Gardens are free to walk around.",,
,,Nature park in the centre of city,4,,"This is a big park and has specific facilities like Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. Tickets are for either or both. Both Dome and Forest are pretty far away from the main entrance gate. I paid $3 for shuttle ride ticket. It took 5 minutes to get to the entrance of Dome and Forest. If you walk to there, you have to take 20-30 minutes. I recommend taking a shuttle.",,
,,This is what the future will look like,5,,I kid you not this is so futuristic I'm Dreaming it's like a science book coming to life this place is fabulous I would definitely recommend it spectacular scenery Greenery flowers very friendly for families elderly or couples make sure to bring good walking shoes as there's a lot of walking to be around. Go to Bayfront MRT station and follow the directions towards Gardens by the Bay.,,
,,Gardens of joy..,5,,"What a good mornings visit, well worth the time a really good site. Interesting with lots to see and friendly helpful staff.",,
,,Wonderful and impressive place!,5,,"I can highly recommend this place, it is a must while being in Singapore!

This place (or better paradise) has been designed with much love and passion, you can definitely feel it!

Thank you so much for having built another amazing place in Singapore! Will come back next year!",,
,,Awesome!,5,,A must see activity when visiting Singapore. A delight of the senses if you love wonderful gardens. The workmanship in setting out the different 'zones' to the sculptures dotted around the place can't speak highly enough of this magnificent venue.,,
,,Beautiful Gardens,5,,"Beautiful gardens and very interesting for all nature lovers. The gardens are free to walk around and there is a light show in the evening which is also free.
You have to pay to visit the flower Dome and Cloud Forest the ticket for both is about SGD 28. If you are visiting Singapore this should be one of your to do lists.",,
,,Suitable for families and couples,4,,"Near Bayfront MRT station, GBTB is suitable for families outing or couples dating time. Surround yourself with the abundance of plants and flowers in the Gardens, and do visit the 2 domes! And don't miss the lightshow at the Supertrees every evening, 7.45pm and 8.45pm!",,
,,What an adventure,5,,"This was just pure joy, I enjoyed every minute of it, a must to put on the to do list in Singapore , make sure you have your cameras ready and breath in all that鈥檚 happening there",,
,,A Must Do In Singapore,5,,"Arrived via MRT, on exiting the station there was staff there to answer questions and show you to the shuttle buses and ticket booths. Shuttle buses are not included in the price and have to be paid for separately. The flower dome had a sunflower display which was beautifully arranged with Wizard of Oz characters. The cloud forest was awe inspiring, with a huge waterfall, supposedly the highest in the world. You may want to pack a light cardigan as the temperature is controlled and can be quite chilly. Both conservatories exit through the same expensive gift shop. The outside gardens are worth a stroll, but unfortunately the sky walk was closed all day due to bad weather. The light show was a twice nightly spectacular when we visited and is well worth a watch. There are numerous restaurants to suit every pocket and as we visited on a weekend there was a street food event with over twenty different outlets. There is free wifi throughout the park.",,
,,My second time and still blown away,5,,"I have been to Gardens by the Bay before with my family. This time I was traveling on business and my colleague wanted to visit Gardens by the Bay. So I just tagged along and it had been a good decision. I felt just as awestruck as the first time. We visited both the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest. I just love the stroll in the cloud forest. We were there around 6 pm and so got the mist too. This is one place, even if crowded with tourists, makes me feel peaceful. We took a tea break in the Cafe inside flower dome (Pollen) and then went on the see the 7:45 pm light show. I know I will go back to Gardens by the Bay again. It will just never get old.",,
,,Lightshow is a must-see,5,,"This park is lovely for a walk, but the main attraction is definitely the lightshow at the supertrees every evening. I strongly recommend this to both travellers and locals.",,
,,Facinating gardens by the bay in Singapore,5,,"The gardens by the bay are remarkable in Singapore, you will see and climb the giant trees. A lift takes you to the elevated walkway. If you are afraid of heights this is not for you. The graden area is huge and it takes at least 2 hours to walk around it. You could spend many more hours if you have the time to do so.

Bad cats of Brissy",,
,,Trip to the beautiful Arti Gardens,5,,"Such a Big place would recommend having wheelchairs for the elderly going there, young just walk the area the 2 dome are payable and estimated about 2hrs each to tour a total of 5to6hrs spent here a sure place to go to 馃榾",,
,,Gardens by the Bay,4,,"I only visited the rainforest part but wow this place is beautiful, the flowers and waterfall are out of this world, well worth a visit.",,
,,I could have spent a week here,5,,And not even everything was open - Cloud Forest was closed for renovation. We went up the trees to the walkway - do not skip that - there is a view to die for. And we circled back in the evening for one of the best light shows I have ever seen. Loads of people laying on the grass looking up to the futuristic trees and lights. Singapore is crazy clean so that's ok. There's also a string of restaurants at the far end of the garden - sort of cafeteria style. Good for a break in the day.,,
,,Beautiful lush place,5,,Just a stunning must see beautiful place! So neat and tidy- like Singapore tbh with lots to do and see.,,
,,Beautiful flowers,4,,"Huge area, very well kept and set beneath Marina Bay Sands : well worth a visit.

They have some amazing flowers and a fantastic gift shop plus many different walks and huge domed greenhouses!

There is a charge for entry into the greenhouses, but everything else is free for you to wander around.

There are eateries there too and I can recommend highly Indochine, which sits high in one of the 鈥渢rees鈥? but you must book!",,
,,View from Marina Bay Sands,3,,We never actually went to Gardens by the Bay. The view from Marina Bay Sands as we looked down upon the gardens was beautiful enough. Plus we enjoyed the entire light show at night from the comforts of our balcony.,,
,,4 days in Singapore,5,,Great place to go to at night with fantastic light shows in the trees. Satay by the Bay was also great for a very cheap food hall type meal outside .,,
,,Sadly Overrated,3,,"Gardens by the Bay is a popular attraction in Singapore, and while there are a couple of nice components, overall I found it to be vastly overrated.

It is a nice enough place to spend an hour or two if you are in the area, but I wouldn't make a special trip for it.

TIP: Don't visit if you have recently been to Kew Gardens, England.",,
,,Must visit,5,,We visited at night in time for the light show! We got a position and lay on the floor on our backs and took all the breath taking views in! I would recommend it to any one!,,
,,Wow! - more than amazing,5,,A big public park with two superdomes (effectively mega greenhouses) crammed with exotic plants from all over the world and a glade of Supertrees which are spectacularly lit up at night with two of them joined by a 22m high walkway with parkwide views. (several of the supertrees are vents for the subterranean power system venting fresh air out from the filters hidden underground). Ample cafes and restaurants in the park all low to medium priced. A great day out for a whole family with play areas for kids too and very clean and safe even after dark,,
,,Lovely way to spend a day and or evening,5,,"Great gardens from around the world. In orchid season, they are superb. You can walk around and enjoy the external gardens for free, or go into the domes and enjoy the special gardens therein. Night is a laser and music spectacular- all for free!",,
,,Beautiful and a must visit,5,,A wonderful experience on your visit to Singapore. Stunning displays that are accessible under the iconic MBS (Marina Bay Sands) hotel and entry to most of the gardens are free entry. For a small fee you can take a ride around the gardens on a viewing cart. Entry to the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome in a massive greenhouse is extra. Great photographic opportunities here.,,
,,"Very Informative, pleasant day out.",5,,"The park itself is quite large and we walked most if it before seeing the main attractions. The two main domes were very good for those interested in flowers and plants from around the world and surprisingly cool and pleasant inside.
The ice cream in the gift shop was also pretty good!",,
,,Very Well Maintained,5,,Some of the areas of the tropical forest are surreal and look futuristic! Nice place to visit with family.,,
,,I WIsh I Knew The Bulk Of The Park Was Free,5,,"I've been to Singapore three times and finally saw the Gardens by the Bay. And, finally discovered that 90% of the park is free. I'll share what I learnt about visiting Gardens by the Bay.

Gardens by the Bay (90% of the park): Free, open from 5am to 2am, daily.

Highlight: Lightshow at Supertree Grove at 7:45pm and 8:45pm, each evening.

We visited the Gardens by the Bay in two visits.

We arrived at the park around 8:15pm, took a wander around, and then got into position for the light show. The park is seriously spectacular at night, and definitely more enhanced at night.

We then went back the next morning to see the two conservatories. This is when you need to pay.

Cooled conservatories (Around 20C temperature)
Flower Dome and Cloud Forest
9.00am - 9.00pm daily
Combined Price (for both conservatories is $SG28. We did find a third-party website which was selling combined tickets for $23, and sent tickets straight to your phone and scan upon entering (google search 'discount gardens by the bay tickets').

Each observatory is around an hour each to get through (and that is at a quick pace). There is a lot to see.

They are seriously well worth seeing. They are world's best standard.

Walking: You are going to do a serious amount of walking to/from, and, in the Gardens by the Bay.

$3 Shuttle Service: For those who don't want to do a lot of walking, consider the $3 Shuttle Service

Food and Drink: There are tonnes and tonnes of restaurants, cafes, McDonalds, etc within the park. We ate at one Chinese restaurant near the conservatories and it was rather nice. I have heard really good things about the cafe that is actually in the Flower Dome. Rest assured, there are food outlets and drinks availability absolutely everywhere throughout the park.

How Long: In one visit, to see the three essentials: light show and both conservatories, you would need three hours, probably more like four hours.

Advice: If you don't have time to do it all in one go, don't. I think the way we did it by seeing part of it at night, then came back in the morning to see the conservatories was perfect. Nothing like being in a 20C world-class conservatory when it is 32C and 85% humidity outside.

Transport: Catch the MRT to Bayfront, and head towards Sands at Marina Bay Shoppes exit, and go via the shoppes. Then, there is a massive underground tunnel that takes you under the road and up right near the entrance to the park.",,
,,Beautiful lights,5,,"The lights were beautiful , we got thee late at night so didn't see a lot of the gardens but the lights were great and so was the view of the city with all the lights lit up",,
,,Beautiful garden,4,,"Loved this garden and the design provides some chances to avoid the heat. Water and toilets available, and it not a huge as the map might lead you to believe so walking around is very possible. Lots of wildlife if you look carefully.",,
,,Gardens a must,5,,My recommendation is to visit early evening and make sure you are there when the trees are lit up. It's spectacular for the photographer. Gardens are very pleasant to walk and enjoy...several hours. Plenty of snack or coffee shops inside.,,
,,Forest in the cloud 馃尌,4,,Saw a very nice tropical forest with waterfall etc. It's totally man-made and worth a sight. The plants are all from the forest and they are kept healthy. Mist is sprayed giving a cloudy sensation is great. Do watch the small educational film while going out,,
,,Beautiful place to walk around,4,,"Had a great time walking around here one evening, it is beautiful but busy as it鈥檚 one of the most popular places in Singapore. We didn鈥檛 go in and pay for anything as we only had a couple of hours to explore. You鈥檒l be able to take some great pictures and enjoy a unique experience.",,
,,Go early,5,,We went early for opening. Avoids a lot of the crowds and allows for good access to all the attractions. Cloud forest is especially impressive.,,
,,Must see!,4,,Great place that raise awarness about global warming. Beautiful species of flowers. Great view on the bay,,
,,Must visit if you come to Singapore,5,,"This is a landmark in Singapore that you must visit. Both the flower dome and forest dome are very well designed, but can get a bit chilly if you are sensitive to cold temperature. Entire garden is flush with greens. Not to forget the super tree!",,
,,My garden views,5,,"A wonderful display in terms of appearance and information,worth revisiting again and again. I would recommend to all visitors to Singapore",,
,,Family,5,,Missed out last time we were here definitely wasn't going to miss out this time. Glad we made the effort cause we weren't dissappointed. Fabulous flowers and wooden sculptures.,,
,,spectacular view,5,,went there late afternoon wth old classmate and daugther enjoy drinks while viewing spectacular theme park display,,
,,Stunning gardens,5,,Amazing place to spend the day both the domes are well worth a visit and also worth spending time outside. You may even be lucky enough to see the wild otters that now live in the bay.,,
,,Beautiful and well worth a visit,5,,Paid a visit here during the daytime when I visited for the Formula 1. Very enjoyable with some stunning views to be had. The supertrees ae something else.,,
,,Beautiful and worth the time to go and see it,5,,Very pretty . You need to look at it day and night.Great to see it of a night up on the Sky deck. Beautiful indoor waterfall to look at as well.,,
,,Mostly Disappointing,1,,After reading the reviews I was super excited to go here. I was overwhelmingly disappointed. And that's something coming from some one who loves the garden. The only thing worth seeing was the light show. Unfortunately we could not do the sky walk due to the weather. I would never waste my time going back,,
,,Breathtaking,5,,Absolutely spectacular. First came here in 2014 and the growth is amazing. The variety of plants incredible. Around every bend is another surprise especially in the two domes. Love it all. Look forward to seeing the development in future trips.,,
,,"Lovely, light show is great to watch.",4,,"Use mrt - quick way to get there. We arrived around 5pm and did both domes before the 745 light show. The flower dome was nice, look out for the wooden sculptures. The cloud dome was spectacular though. It is wet when you go in, I would recommend light jacket or shawl as it can get cool. If you do not like heights, you may not like the walkways but it is spectacular to see. The light show is in the super tree grove, so you need to allow ten minutes or so to get from the domes to the grove, make sure you follow the signs to the walkway/super tree so you end up in the right spot to see the biggest tree which is the centre piece for the light show. The light show goes for around ten minutes, it was pretty packed. Afterward stairway to MRT was super busy - we went for a walk around the lakes while the queue died down, which was lovely in the cool evening. MRT to get back, which was quick",,
,,Garden with a Jurassic Park feel,3,,"We went for a quick afternoon wander around the gardens and found it very akin to a theme park. Staff recommended we spend 45-60mins in each dome (which have seperate entry fees) so being time poor we opted to just visit the Cloud Forest ($8 fee). There was not much to see between the attractions, and the views from the Cloud Forest were nice (you could see the F1 track as well as looking out over the bay), with the added bonus of a breeze being so high up. That said, I would not go again and the views from the top of MBS are better.",,
,,nice view,5,,"enjoy your drink on top of the super tree, that is something special perfect view of the hotel also with cool drink",,
,,Clean and fresh area,4,,Is an artificial garden with a variety of flora from around the world in conditions that are always fresh. Very unique because it was built with interesting artists and pedestrian facilities with attractive self-photo spots. From the bridge can look at Marina Bay well. There are lighting shows at night starting at 8pm. Food and beverage prices are relatively expensive.,,
,,man-made wonders!,5,,love how thoughtful the development of this place is and surely you will feel the wonders of this amazing garden!,,
,,Spectacular at Night,5,,Very Impressive with beautifully manicured displays but it was even more amazing with the light show at night. A must see in singapore.,,
,,lovely place,5,,its like being in paradise if that how paradise is. the cool air inside the flower of dome and cloud forest in hot and humid Singapore,,
,,EXCELLENT ATTRACTION,5,,We loved the gardens and stayed to watch the light show on an evening. We took the tram tour around the gardens so much variety of flowers and plants to see.,,
,,8yrs on and this world reknown park just gets better and better,5,,"I've visited this project / tourist attraction before it was completed and visited the holding stock for the plants and trees before it was installed as part of my work. To see it all come together and be one of the first few batch to stroll through when it was open, and then two years later and then recently .... all were different experiences. A lot of work as gone into maintenance of the garden as not all trees and plants from around the world thrive naturally in this man-made environment. Recommended visit for all locals and tourists. Hey, if nothing else the non-horticultural enthusiasts in your family / entourage will have a chance sit around to cool off in one of the two domes (or both) or grab a snack at the cafe indoors while you walk around and ogle away :p",,
,,"Nature, manufactured",4,,"Visited the flower dome and cloud forest. The conservatories are air-conditioned, which was a welcome respite from Singapore鈥檚 oppressive heat. Slightly pricey, and non-residents don鈥檛 have a choice to just see one, but overall worth it, especially if you consider how much it must cost to maintain all of it.",,
,,"Fantastic, -not to be missed",5,,"Amazing concept and stunning environment, we went in the morning and was not at all crowded. So many amazing plants and flowers, make sure your phone is well charged for all your photos",,
,,Gardens by the Bay visit,3,,"Visited cloud forest. It鈥檚 an artificially created ecosystem. Air conditioning and water droplets spray creates a mood of highland. Waterfall has been created artificially. One of the must visit place in Singapore. The drawback is that everything is man made. If you want to enjoy the nature鈥檚 real beauty, then it鈥檚 not recommended. Last but not least there is another ecosystem along with cloud forest, that is flower dome. Flower done is not recommended.",,
,,Buy tickets online to avoid the long queues,4,,"My family and I make regular visits to the Flower Dome to see the seasonal flower displays (Sakura, Chinese New Year, Christmas, National Day etc.) Check the Gardens by the Bay website to see what's on.

While online, book your tickets to avoid having to join the long queues. They will scan the QR-code in your handphone email to gain admission.

One suggestion for improvement would be to run the Shuttle trolley service and sale of tickets at 8.45 am, 15 min before the Flower Dome opens. Currently, the shuttle trolley service and the ticket sales starts at 9 am, which means you will miss the opening time unless you choose to walk, which is not feasible for elderly visitors.

Once inside the Flower Dome, take the obligatory pic at the foyer and head straight down by the staircase to the main flower display area. This area attracts the most people and you would want to be early to take pics without hordes of people in the background.

Once that is done, you can backtrack to see all the other sections. If you love succulents and cacti, do not miss the the uppermost section.

You will definitely find much to enjoy inside the Flower Dome, especially the air-con. You can give the Cloud Forest and the Super-trees a miss if you are short of time. Frankly they are over-rated.",,
,,Bucket List must see!,5,,"The two domes are worth the fee to go into, the plants and atmosphere are amazing. You must stay for the sound and light show in the giant trees, simply a bucket list thing to see and experience. Set aside a good part of a day to see everything and then stay for the light show. There are eateries on site for lunch etc.",,
,,Singapore GP,5,,This is really well done and a lot of effort and maintenance goes into this day in day out. A credit to the Singapore community. A highlight of the trip,,
,,Amazing night with the family,5,,"Mid autumn festival is round the corner. Gardens by the bay having lantern lighting event, not to be missed.",,
,,Absolutely must!,5,,"Have to visit! It is incredible!

Both Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. Tickets can but anywhere - airport, hotels, entrance ticket office (better buy before).

Recommend to visit twice - day and night.

Night also have light show where Super trees located. 7.45 and 8.45. This one - no need tickets.

Try to avoid weekend if possible - many people. During week not that many.",,
,,Awesome!,5,,Spent the whole day in the amazing Gardens by the Bay. Lots to see. The Domes are amazing. Lots of restaurants to eat in. Super trees are beautiful. Musical light show well worth seeing. A must see.,,
,,Fantastic,5,,"Super place, lovely things to see, skywalk, evening light display, good reasonable food within the park, a must see!!",,
,,Well worth a visit,5,,The thought care and engineering that went into designing this amazing place is incredible. Something for everybody. Worth a visit if you have a few days in Singapore.,,
,,Nice evening,4,,"Upon arriving here we found it a little confusing as it was not clear where everything was, however, after a little exploring, we were able to locate the Skyway (which was very busy) and queue up to enter.

We attended in the evening and we were in time for one of the two light shows. I would definitely recommend attending during this time as there are beautiful views across Marina Bay and the lighting and music were fun.

Due to the time that we arrived, we were not able to explore the conservatory which was a shame as we did not make the most of our time in the gardens.

Based on the views that we saw on the ground and once up on the Skyway, I would recommend any visitors to Singapore to come and take a look.",,
,,Beautiful Gardens,5,,"Felt busy and safe for an hour stroll through the park at night on my own. Highly recommend, especially a night visit.",,
,,Always a great day out when family and friends visit,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is like no other. Acres and acres of beautifully landscaped gardens, well-labelled trees and plants, plenty of shady areas to stay out of the sun, a fun water park area for the little ones to run around, get soaked and cool down, 2 amazing domes filled with trees and plantations from all over the world and even a waterfall in one, extremely wheelchair friendly, eating options from the local style hawker to the posh restaurant atop one of the giant trees. And twice every night at 745pm and 845pm, free captivating themed light shows with accompanying music entertains the crowd. A definite must see as it's quite uniquely Singapore.",,
,,Amazing gardens in Marina Bay!!,5,,A must visit whilst in Singapore. Large gardens complex with lots to see and plenty of activities to do. A very popular place for tourists and locals doing their daily exercise!!,,
,,Plants!,3,,I鈥檓 not a plant/tree person but my husband wanted to visit. There is lots to see but you have to pay to go into the domes which costs $28 dollars. The gift shops are lovely with unusual gifts and at reasonable prices.,,
,,Enjoy in air conditioned different Seasons of flowers,5,,A visit to this place is a must for visitors who hates the heat in this tropical island country. You can enjoy the beautiful flowers of different seasons including tropical plants in various varieties.,,
,,Amazing,5,,The flowers/trees form around the world are fit in these domes.The architecture and the self sustaining ecosystem is amazing! they also made it a point to have a theme for every occassion. This is worth visiting!,,
,,Unbelievable.,5,,Gardens by the bay is one of my favourite places in the entire world to visit. Its like a land of its own. Plenty of things to do and see most are free of charge. The light show is a MUST as are the flower and cloud domes.,,
,,Beautiful at night,5,,Visited early evening as park began to light up We went up to super tree bar at the top of one of the trees. Fantastic view and stunning lights,,
,,Just wanna go back again and again,5,,"Probably my favourite outing spot in Singapore with my 6-year old daughter. I particularly love the Flower Dome and enjoy the different themes presented throughout the year. My daughter loves the outdoor water park. We tried the Sky Walk recently and had a more than thrilling experience.

Even the walk to and from the train station boasts spectacular views. Definitely worth the time and the sweat. Walk from MBS around 4 pm for scenery by day, visit the domes, do the skywalk around sunset, watch the light show at 8pm and walk back to MBS after that for night scenery.",,
,,SO stunning,5,,"This place is so magical. Despite being a tourist area it does not seem unnatural or overpopulated. It just felt so amazing to be here and walking through the gardens, the cloud forest and everything else!
I like that there are a range of restaurants here to choose from, meeting all tastes and budgets. They really have thought it through when building this. It is very child friendly with baby stations everywhere.
I will definitely be back on my next trip to Singapore.",,
,,"Worth the cost of entry, beware crowds",5,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens are magnificent! I wasn't sure about the entry cost, but buying online from a third party (Headout) seemed to get us admission a few dollars cheaper with no issues. The Cloud Forest and Flowerdome are both worthwhile and you can spend an hour plus easily at both. You can get stamps for re-entry too.

I didn't realise this at the time but it's kind of perfect for a rainy day activity too. Which Singapore trends to have quite a bit of! Both the domes are climate controlled/ covered so it's quite relaxing to spend some time in. I went on a weekend late afternoon and the crowds were pretty intense - everyone wants to get in for their selfie/ shot. The gardens are well maintained on the diversity of flora is awesome. The Cloud Forest path is more linear, there's a queue due to the first step being to get up the escalator but it moved at a surprising pace, at least on our day there.

Lots of bathrooms and the chilled water from the drinking fountains nearby were tasty!",,
,,Fantastic,5,,"Hugely impressed by the dome structures and the massive inventory of plants they contained. The organisation of planting, the condition of plants and trees was remarkable. It would be easy to spend a whole day here. The only downside - and this sadly applies to so many places - are the individuals who seem compelled to shoot a selfie in front of every stem, flower, branch, leaf and waterfall.",,
,,Wonderful,4,,Wonderful lush well kept gardens. Could spend the whome day there. Lots tk see and do. Loved every minute.,,
,,Just stunning,5,,A full day or more is really needed for this stunning area of Singapore! The beauty created here is a must to see.,,
,,Beautiful green space,5,,Lovely walks around the bay through differing flora and fauna and sculptures. You can view the displays for free from the marina bay hotel or pay to explore the bio domes and environments. Worth the entrance price but there is a lot of walking,,
,,Amazing light show,5,,"Initially I was not interested in Gardens by the Bay because it seemed a bit too commercial and manufactured, but we went for the light show one evening and we were not disappointed. We did not spent much time walking around the gardens (we had spent the day at the National Orchid Gardens and were a bit tired), but I don't regret going for the light show. It was very impressive and an easy subway ride from our hotel.",,
,,Astounding,4,,Our second visit to this paradise. A must for any bucket list. No visit to Singspore is complete without a stroll around the gardens.,,
,,Holiday,5,,"Beautiful location, peaceful and very picturesque. Plenty to see in a very well kept garden, that is very clean and very well maintained. Restaurants and things to do are easy to access with lots of choices of food.",,
,,Amazing evening view with mid autumn festival light up,5,,"Highlight has to be mid autumn festival light up in Sep. The park is efficiently run with wide enough spaces to accommodate a large crowd. Gradually I ve realised, the iconic Supertrees have started to be representative of the Little red dot which has Big dreams.",,
,,"Greenery, relaxing",5,,Great place for families to catch a forest environment architecturally designed and built within a city.,,
,,Light Show,4,,The light show at Gardens by the Bay is shown twice each night and well worth a look. Not too crowded and a few vantage points to see from. Plenty of taxis to take you on for dinner or back to your hotel after the show is over.,,
,,Garden by the Bay gift shop,4,,After finish walking and seeing lots of plant and sunflower. You may enter to gifts shop to see what you plan to buy,,
,,It鈥檚 getting too crowded these days,4,,Got an annual pass to visit the flower domes and ocbc skywalk.. it鈥檚 ok- the exhibit changes... guess i don鈥檛 really like crowds hence it鈥檚 getting too overwhelming for me these days,,
,,Must See,5,,Excellent site to visit just illustrates the color and diversity of the worlds plant life in one place,,
,,Nice and big,4,,Very nice garden with very nice design Located next to marina bay Good to spend time there and take photos Avoid it if it鈥檚 raining or sunny,,
,,Stunning even when it鈥檚 raining!,5,,"Even though the rain out a damper on the walk above the trees, the lights were amazing. Plenty to see....light shows were great.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,This is an amazing place to visit. Most beautiful gardens and the most interesting plants. The Flower Dome and Cloud Forest is a must.,,
,,Beautiful,5,,"These gardens are simply amazing. They are in zoned areas each zone depicting a different species. Beautifully kept and the whole place is so clean, entrance is free but you do pay if you want to go in the domes and do the sky walk. They are well worth going in the array of plants and the beautiful waterfall are stunning.There is also a shuttle that will take you round the gardens with commentary.
There are places to eat and drink but these were on the pricey side. The only bad thing about the whole visit was the state of the toilets. I had thought that they would be very clean, but sadly not.",,
,,A must see particularly the Super Trees,4,,"There is a lot to see but depends on what your preference is. There are gardens, cloud forest and more gardens. Have a look and pick what you want to do. For me, it was the Super Trees that were the best, particularly at night. Some of the things are free, others you have to pay for. Pick the combination you want to see and get a good value ticket. You can spend an hour here or a whole day depending on your interests.",,
,,Not so impressed,3,,not so impressed. Actually I feel it was a mere tourist attraction on the inside but from outside it was very nice,,
,,Absolutely amazing,4,,Just can鈥檛 miss this amazing attraction at all! The night show by the huge trees the indoor waterfall is absolutely stunning! Mind blowing!,,
,,A must,5,,After 3 recent trips to Singapore I finally made it to the Gardens. They did not disappoint. Well worth the entrance fee to the two domes and the trees. A must do in Singapore!,,
,,Big day of walking,5,,"Highly recommended including the tree top walk, cloud and flower garden as extra tickets. Very different in the day to at night. We went in the afternoon and experienced the park during the day. Wondered down to satay by the bay for dinner then returned to our accomodation through the park at night to see it all at both times of the day. Has an amazing light show on the giant trees at night. Get there early if you want a good spot but anywhere is good to be honest.",,
,,Sci-fi gardens,5,,"If you will be in Singapore, you must go to see Gardens by the Bay, it a unique place to enjoy... I can鈥檛 compare with anything else.Special, amazing and interesting...",,
,,Stunning,5,,We was blown away by the light show stunning tree structures the music was excellent too highly recommend this place,,
,,One of the world's wonders,5,,This is a must-see for everyone - wow-per-minute indicator goes off the scale. A family with a kid can easily spend 2 full days there.,,
,,A nice addition to Singapore,4,,"The concept and execution of the park has been well done by Singapore and was certainly reflected in the numbers of people visiting on what was Grand Prix weekend.

Perhaps it's almost too neat , too perfect. While it was all very lush and green it was perhaps too managed. Did enjoy the Koy fish pond though!",,
,,Excellent place but mind the working hours,5,,"While everywhere it's written that it's open by 2am in fact the admission ends at 7pm and the garden domes are closed by 8pm.

We've spent 1 hour in each of the dome and could spend much more; so interesting and inspiring! However I suggest to visit Cloud Garden sometime before 7pm because at 7 they start to diffuse mist and it looks terrific during sunset.",,
,,Stunning view!!!,5,,"This is the place I would recommended for all the tourists to visit, as this is the one of iconic place in Singapore. Overall was amazing experience for me and such a lot of tourists attractions.",,
,,A full day can be spent here,5,,"This place is amazing. It has flowers, art, and smart design. Covered gardens of cactus and rain forest locations. Aircon domes afford a break from the humidity to extend your endurance. Street style food, light displays with music after sun set. This place has it all. Combine your ticket purchase to get your monies worth at the garden ticket booth.",,
,,Worth a Look,4,,"I was at the gardens last year with my family and loved it. I took my sister there on this trip and whilst enjoyed most of it, was disappointed to see more sunflowers than orchids. Hopefully things will improve before my next trip to Singapore. The Cloud is always worth a visit, as well as the Skywalk after dark.",,
,,Besutiful,4,,A beautiful garden with so many different plants and trees. A different experience weather you visit in by day or night. I would recommend to enter the domes to see all the exotic plants and the big waterfall.,,
,,Beautful,4,,"Did the night Gardens by the Bay and really enjoyed it. A must, probably better doing it in your own time and not a tour. We were really rushed.",,
,,Must visit,5,,"Magical place to visit day or night.... really well maintained....I personally didn't like the train ride (you pay around $5au) but that is my opinion. The place is stunning during and it has a huge artificial waterfall....will take you a minimum of 3hours to visit the two doms as they are not connected and you have to exit one to enter the other. If you traveled by Singapore Airlines please take your boarding pass with you to get a discount....this place is heaven for flowers photography.
At night the magic begins...light show with beautiful music and it is all for free. You don't have to book a tour to visit as you can walk to it from the city centre and it is very close to the train station...enjoy",,
,,A must!,5,,Excellent by day public transport takes you straight there. We went back for the night show and it was definitely worth it.,,
,,"Nice garden, tourist atraction.",3,,"Nice and cool environment. Different flowers and trees, but not realy worth the money in my opinion. Gardens around the indoor part just as nice to visit.",,
,,Lovely - Must visit,5,,The kind of flora at this place amazes you. You find so much in one place which you wouldn't have found all you life put together. So well maintained.,,
,,Must must must,5,,"This gardens is most beautiful gardend in world the super tree is beautiful we spent ther few hours and we enjoy every minnute.
It's good for young and old as well. The entrance is free but if you want to entrance to gardens and rain forest it will cost you 15 us $ 28 sd per each.
It must to do it",,
,,Nice visit,3,,"A very nice place to visit. So beautiful. But I suggest maybe u can lower the ticket price. Somemore, the food court (Satay of the Bay) is quite far from the main entrance. Easy to get cab from the park. Anyway, two thumbs up.",,
,,Superb!,5,,"Fabulous Gardens - so well set out. Also great sculptures/art along the way. We didn't pay to go into the ""Domes"" and enjoyed the whole experience for free!",,
,,Woeful show,1,,"I attended the light and music show tonight after having attended in March last year and loving it.
Tonight was woeful.
The music was ghastly ( it had Dean Martin or Frank Sinatra singing Moon River I think ) and the lights were slow and boring to accompany it.
I got there 75 mind esy intending to watch both shows.
It wasn鈥檛 just me disappointed compared to last years 鈥楪arden Waltzs鈥?music and fantastic lights.
The people next to me who had been there before me walked out after 5 mins as did numerous other people.
Another neighbour who鈥檚 camera battery was nearly flat asked if I would send her the video I was going to take, but then sai don鈥檛 bother.
What is the management thinking !!
Sack the music director and go back to the Garden Waltz sound track and lively lights.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,The gardens are amazing and not something I thought I would enjoy. The sculptures within the gardens are exquisite. Definitely worth visiting but make sure you wear comfy shoes and take water!,,
,,Fantastic visit!,5,,"When I was in Singapore last this was just being built and couldn't wait to get to see it all finished.
Gardens by the Bay is a great attraction for all. Was not disappointed in the slightest. Amoungst the many themed gardens there are the main three attractions- the Flower Dome (which had some great beauty on show and the smell was amazing), the Cloud Forest dome (where you can explore the jungle plants and rainforest and walk in the canopy) and the OBC Skyway (which holds great views of Marina Bay area - is an extra $8 fee). Is a great day out with plenty to see.",,
,,Beautiful arrangement,5,,Cloud forest is not to be missed and also the light & sound show in the evening. Its quite close to Marina Bay and has a beatiful view of it,,
,,Absolutely beautiful,5,,We were fortunate enough to stay at the marina bay overlooking the gardens. The light show in the evening was spectacular and could be seen from many different areas. The lights and music was very relaxing and entrancing,,
,,A must see in Singapore,5,,"Yes it is very touristy and it cost a bit to get in the domes, but in my opinion it is worth it and I would probably do it again if I returned to Singapore. My favorite part is definitely the sky walk between the man made trees. The view is amazing and I highly recommend going there just before sunset to see the place transform when the lights on the trees are turned on. There is also a light show to a piece of music at night and that is also very beautiful.",,
,,Must do in Singapore,4,,"Great way to escape the heat, and interesting. Not a world beating attraction in my mind, but worth seeing.",,
,,Good but not must,3,,Been here with kids... U need a hardcore enthusiastic person to enjoy such places.. while intial 15-20 mins i enjoyed but then gotten bored to see various plants or trees which u cannot differentiate much.,,
,,Enjoyed the time!,4,,"I recommend to visit this place at around afternoon. There are few spots to see and it鈥檚 better to visit while daylight is still there because orchid garden closes in the evening. I would suggest to start with the map of the place so that you know where are you now exactly and which spots are nearby to you and you can plan accordingly. Enjoying the 鈥渟ong of the trees鈥?is worthwhile. There are two schedules with one hour difference between them. Trying the sky bridge was a good experience indeed and it didn鈥檛 cost much too! From there you can enjoy a good view of the Singapore City.

Additional tips: It鈥檚 15minutes walking distance from Marina Bay.",,
,,One of the most amazing places in Singapore,5,,I usually frequent this place once in a few weeks. Lovely place indeed. Plenty of flowers to see. Lush foliage. The place requires lots of loving tender care and the plants look really well cared for. A top destination indeed.,,
,,Brilliant visit,5,,We spent a day walking around the outdoor gardens and in the two domes. They are brilliantly set up and a true must see. Thoroughly enjoyed looking and learning about the different plants and their ecosystem.,,
,,FLOWER 馃尫 DOME,5,,New attractions in Singapore 馃嚫馃嚞! I guess every month has its flower theme. And twas really amazingly beautifull!,,
,,Must see,5,,"We spent an afternoon at the Gardens by the Bay, visiting both enclosed domes but not the elevated tree walk. It was very busy but the crowd was managed very efficiently. The views, experience and ambience were excellent.",,
,,DO NOT BUY YOUR TICKETS TROUGH TRIP ADVISOR.,1,,"My brother bought tickets for the gardens through Trip Advisor. When we arrived we waisted an hour trying to contact TA as they had failed to send the correct email with bar code to actually access the attraction. They did sort it after the service center contacted them, but caused a bunch is stress and waisted a bunch of precious holiday time . Avoid trip advisor to avoid the stress.",,
,,Beautiful garden,5,,We went quite late at night but the gardens are beautiful and the supertrees are so beautiful. We wanted to come for the kid's water park but we couldn't manage to come again.,,
,,Outstandingly amazing,5,,"Returned from a cruise and spent the day here. Could have stayed forever. The staff, especially Lexus on the skyway were very friendly and attentive. We took the short audio tour around the park which cost $8 each(they only take cash here). This drops you at the flower dome. Cost to enter both domes is 鈧?8 and $8 for the skyway, but we got this complimentary as we had tickets for the Grand Prix. Everything was well kept and stunning. We did not go up the tallest tree for a drink as the bar was closed but there is an additional charge of $20 which includes a drink from the bar. Great for all ages including disabled.",,
,,AMAZING,5,,"With every penny, amazing place if you are into nature and cool stuff really a must in Singapore and also the show at the end I almost cried, a very magical experience",,
,,Colourful Garden at night,5,,Had a great time though it was hot and humid. Night time is the best time to visit as it was a bit cooling.,,
,,Fabulous sights here,4,,We got off at the wrong station and sadly had a huge walk in the heat. After that our visit was lovely. A very hot spot but cooler in the domes.,,
,,great experience,5,,"as a singapore citizen, it was my first time at the gardens by the bay conservatories. i only went to the flower dome and was really impressed the moment i walked in. the smell of flowers and the atmosphere was really cooling and refreshing, although the flowery smell might get a little heavy for some. it was okay for me once i got used to it in the first few minutes. really pretty & great experience being indoors and outdoors at the same time hahaha. recommended to go but do take note that there are quite a lot of people there especially during holiday seasons/ weekends!",,
,,"Great gardens, prepare for all weather.",4,,"This is a gorgeous place to easily spend half a day walking around enjoying the many different styles of gardens and sculptures. Be prepared for crowds and possible rain. The cloud forest and flower garden are spectacular and worth the money to go inside. A warning for serious photographers! When you transit between greenhouses and outside, be aware that due to the high humidity nature of this country, your lens will fog up and it will take ages to equalise the temperature! I would have given it 5 stars, but I found navigating the huge park difficult with the maps provided. There were too many paths that were not listed and it was confusing, more signs would have been great, some arrows.",,
,,Amazing place,5,,Very nice place to visit specially the night show. You can see the garden for free except if you want to visit 2 different areas.,,
,,God Glorifying!!!,5,,"The beautiful scenery is GOD Glorifying. Fell in love with the flowers, plants and the place itself馃槏 Super clean馃槏",,
,,Beautiful park showcasing nature at its most beautiful,4,,"Large park with a series of special attractions showing the spectacular world of plants and tree life on a grand-scale. The park part is free and has water features and walkways that include cafes and places to sample a wide range of Asian cooking. There are some colourful displays that come alive at night. The place is open til midnight or later at weekends. A great place to escape the hustle and bustle of busy Singapore. Great for families and school trips too. Good place for keep fit people too.

The main paid attractions are the stunning Flower dome where it is always Spring. The place is a staggering site and the wide arrange of flowers and displays make you feel like you are in a theme park made of flowers. Not sure if things change but when I was there it was a fairytale theme with references to the Wizard of Oz as well as Winnie the Pooh. Lovely and cool the walk around is a relaxing delight. Also visit the nice little cafe called Pollen.

The Cloud Forest is a stunning recreation of a mountain and waterfall display with walkways allowing you to see the jaw dropping variety of plant life covering the enormous structure. Along with stalagmites and stalactites displays. There is also a Lego display of flowers mixed in with the real ones. The walkways and the views, along with mist displays, truly make you appreciate how beautiful the natural world is. The attraction ends with a reminder that humans are the ones that are slowly but surely destroying this beautiful world around us. Some shocking statistics and pictures plus film. A must see.

The other paid element is a walkway in the park area which gives you a birds eye view of part of the park and views of the Bay Marina Sands Hotel. The walkway is the least interesting so if you want to save money don鈥檛 worry about this one. But the first two are incredible and if it is hot and humid these areas are wonderfully cool.

I spent hours here and loved the walk around the park plus the cafes and souvenir shop. Don鈥檛 miss this place.",,
,,Dazzling illumination & light display at SuperTree Grove,5,,"It's been a while that I had been to our famous Gardens By the Bay, located right across Marina Bay Sands Hotel.

This is the F1 weekend, with the practice session in the afternoon. And this coincides with our Mid Autumn Festival.

I took this opportunity to revisit the Gardens By The Bay. Had read about the Cultural Performances but I missed it as I came on time for the usual light display with lovely music - and this dazzling light show has been named 'Garden Rhapsody'. There are two show time, at 7.45 pm and 8.45 pm. If you like to take some nice pictures of dusk, I would suggest you reach there by 7.30 pm. The blue light hour would be better with the background Colour of the sky. The light show lasts for 15 minutes. As the colour changes, it is so surreal and at some point, it is reminiscent of the Avatar land with all the trees in shades of blue.

We celebrate mid Autumn Festival with eating moon cakes and carrying of lanterns.

In the garden, you will find many lanterns both at the colonnade as well as the huge lantern with the name - Dragon Gate, Phoenix and many rabbits in different motion.",,
,,OK to spend few hours,3,,Not so exciting. But it's OK to visit once. The cloud forest and flower display was good. But the rest of it is ok,,
,,Chillax here,4,,"While there's virtually nothing but plants x architectural design in this area, Singapore's Gardens by the Bay is a wonderful escape from the hustle of the city.",,
,,holiday stop over in the gardens,5,,WOW these gardens are amazing and such a peaceful space. Loved the architecture of the setting and the wonderful display and information provided,,
,,An amazing experience.,5,,We came to watch the first light show but couldn't leave because it was so fantastic that we stayed to see the one at nine o`clock as well. It is an experience out of the world... and you have to spend time here to just walk around in this amazing garden.,,
,,Impressive Garden,5,,Very impressive gigantic garden and very futuristic indeed. No dull moment on every species around and the dancing tree light is one to watch at night.,,
,,The place was amazing but too crowded,2,,"I like the concept and the design, it was amazing but the atmosphere was unbelievable crowded. How can you enjoy a green garden with that many people?",,
,,Fantastic night lights,5,,"Try to get there before dark to have a look around first. Each of the 2 domes accept visitors until 8:00pm. The light display of the Super Trees has two sessions starting at 7:45 and 8:45pm which last about 15 minutes. They are outstanding to watch, a real credit to Singapore. It costs nothing to see the SuperTrees but there is an entry fee for the Domes. The train station is called Bayside and is only the second stop on the Blue Line downtown. The entrance to the Gardens is a 5 minute stroll from the station and well signposted. There are a few eateries inside, including Maccas. We caught a taxi from the exit and only waited about 10 minutes in the queue.
Look forward to returning here on our next visit.",,
,,Fab free light show,5,,At 7.45pn and 8.45pm you can enjoy a fab free light show set to classical music amongst the massive trees - great sceptical from Marina Bay Sands hotel balconies or from the gardens themselves- go and enjoy!,,
,,Spectacular!,5,,"Absolutely stunning scenery! It is huge, still quite private too during busy periods. A must visit when in Singapore!",,
,,Must visit when arrive in Singapore.,4,,This place is like the big park in Singapore. there are free and paid area to visit (paid area like the canopy walk or tropical dome) but most of the outside area are free. You must to go If you are photographer. There are lots of view and plants for you to capture! At night around 7-8.00 p.m. there have lighting show at Supertree. And sure it's free!,,
,,"Oh wow, oh wow",5,,"We had wanted to go here for a while. We got to it walking through the foyer of the Marina Sands Hotel foyer which is amazing in its self. We got the shuttle bus for $3 each thinking it would take us around the garden but no, it just takes you to the entrance to the 2 domes and gift shop. This is also the place to walk to the trees to see the night music and light show.
We loved the garden, didn鈥檛 walk around as much as we would like as I was recovering from foot surgery. It is a wonderful place. I鈥檓 not sure I can do justice in words to the night light and music experience. I found myself thanking God for colour, beauty, music the whole package, it was just beautiful, wonderful, amazing and it made our last night of our 8 week holiday and 3 days in Singapore a huge highlight. We love Singapore (except for the heat and humidity) we will go again sometime and would really love to go back to the night lights. If you go to Singapore don鈥檛 miss this.",,
,,Go in the evening for the lightshow,5,,Gardens by the Bay is one of a kind. A beautiful garden within a huge modern city filled with skyscrapers. It鈥檚 a must see in Singapore and I recommend going in the evening.,,
,,I loved it!,5,,"My wife suggested that we try out this place and it was amazing. A little pricey to look at the garden but it was worth it, it was a work of art. Especially the waterfall right when you get in..the downside is that there are so many visitors the line gets pretty long.",,
,,Incredible experience,5,,We visited the Cloud Forest. Really incredible. We did not have time for the Flower Garden and wish we'd given ourselves more time. Definitely recommend for anyone visiting Singapore. Such a unique experience.,,
,,Just beautiful place,5,,"Have a great day in this place, suddenly you will feel to be a part of a Avatar film, amazing, beautiful.",,
,,Just WOW!,5,,"Absolutely a MUST to see during your stay in Singapore, a place where chill and relax. it's really well organize with different facilities, you will find all what you need. To not miss the show in the evening!",,
,,beautiful,4,,"a great place for a weekend outing. a date, or a day of photo-taking. In the evening, expect some beautiful lights. Mesmerising.",,
,,Definitely a must see!,5,,"By all means do not miss visiting the Gardens by the Bay. You should try and go in the afternoon, even if it is a bit more crowded and preferably walk towards it from the Marina Bay Sands hotel on the bridge that connects the hotel with the gardens. In the evening you can really admire the gardens all lit and if you are there after 7 pm you may attend one of the shows. If it is not a rainy day (it will be closed if that's the case) make sure you try the OCBC Skyway.",,
,,Best Garden,5,,"You can say that this is the best Garden having plants, trees and flowers from all over the world. Very well maintained and the lights and sound shows are excellent.",,
,,Gotta go at night,4,,"For a free attraction, it's well worth the visit. If you walked the whole lot it would take quite some time. It's not as tranquil as I'd have thought due to the sheer volume of people!",,
,,"Amazing, amazing",5,,"Think of Avatar, Peter Pan, and the Olympics open and closing ceremony...

We were surprised by the night light show that began when we were wandering through the Gardens by the Bay. And absolutely loved it. Lay down on the pavement to look up at the light show and enjoy the music in the trees above us.

Such a fantastic show, kid friendly and the architectural brilliance of the whole area is such an amazing achievement blending soft and hard landscaping, and buildings that are shaped in only the way your imagination can make them - but they are real.

Really enjoyed our walk, and went right to the end made it a bit far to walk back at the end of the night, but well worth it!

Don't forget the buggy for the kids",,
,,Impossible to overrate this fabulous place,5,,"We have visited gardens around the world and know Singapore parks and gardens well. Somehow we hadn't been to Gardens by the Bay. What an oversight. It is an amazing, beautiful, creative wonderland. Go!",,
,,Definitely a place to visit,5,,"It is amazing and simply beautiful...Love the orchids, the flower dome and the cloud forest, but you can just walk around in the park if you don't like to spend any money",,
,,A Must See Photographers Delight,4,,"This truly is an amazing botanic gardens, of which Singapore can surely be proud of. There is so much to see and experience you could spend many hours soaking up the sights and learning of the huge range of flora on display.",,
,,Must see part of Singapore with kids,5,,"This was probably one of our favourite parts of Singapore, especially with a young 23-month son. There is a kids water park sector, so be sure to bring a towel and a change of clothes! If I had a change of clothes too, I would have jumped in!

The gardens in the evening have a light show too - normally twice a night. Make sure to find a spot in the middle (and on the ground i.e not in the treetop walk) as you get a much better view.

Great place!",,
,,"Nice, worth a short walk around",4,,"Impressive concept, to create land and then....create a park. Considering Singapore's real estate prices already a cool thing.
The garden itself is nice, though not yet at the level of the Botanical garden, will with time will surely gain its own standing.
Worth a short walk around",,
,,Beautiful sunflower exhibition,4,,"We are locals who visited the flower dome last Saturday. There is a current promotion of 20% if passion card is used. The current theme is sunflowers. Visitors can see statues from wizard of oz too. Look out for rabbit, queen of hearts, Dorothy, lion and owl amidst the sunflower exhibitions.",,
,,The Cloud Forest was our second choice on the Day!!,5,,"Had intended doing the Sky Walkway but it closed because of possible lightning on the day - so a refund was requested and we did the Cloud Forest walk instead. Plenty to see while walking and taking a lift up to the top of forest. A really interesting collection of orchids, ferns and other tropical plants. The walk also has an interesting video on how man has affected our environment. The walk ends in the inevitable souvenir shop. Food and drinks are available nearby.
Certainly worth the time and cost to visit !!",,
,,Wonderful experience!,5,,"The Gardens by the Bay was a great experience and adventure for the hubby and I. They have different exhibits such as the Flower dome and the Cloud Forrest. When we went into the flower dome the theme was Wizard of Oz. The exhibit was beautiful with lots of sunflowers as well as other different flowers. The Cloud Forrest was a different experince as if you were walking up into the clouds. As you enter, you will first encounter a big waterfall misting through our entire building. As you keep walking further up you鈥檒l see a wonderful view of the dome filled with exotic flowers and you鈥檒l feel like you鈥檙e up in the mountains. Ouside the gardens they have little statues with different region themes. You will do a lot of walking so if you have kids I recommend you bring their strollers. In the evening they have a musical light show and it was breathtaking and beautiful. A must see and do when visiting Singapore.",,
,,A great way to get pictures of the city,4,,"The gardens can be pretty crowded on weekends and so you can wait quite awhile to get up to the elevated walkway of the Super Grove. That said, the gardens are highly recommended.",,
,,Worth a full day,5,,The flower dome & Cloud forest need time.... so plan for it. These gardens are great no matter the weather outside. Be aware it's cool in the domes so you might want a cardigan!,,
,,Gardens by the Bay- Light Show,5,,"The Gardens by the Bay are outstanding, the man made trees are a beauty. However, if you really want to see the beauty, go and visit the light show at night starting at 1945hrs daily, the trees come to life and lighting changes colours to the tune of classical music. It is a must see, no charge it is free.",,
,,Sunflowers & Lantern Festival at the GBB,4,,"Came tonight with some friends to admire the sunflower display in the Flower Dome & was suitably entertained by the Gardens鈥?efforts to build in Wizard of Oz atmosphere. I never knew there were so many varieties of the gorgeous sunflower, each as vibrant and beautiful in its own right. The accompanying description is informative & helpful. The grounds were alit with vibrant and colourful decorations to celebrate the oncoming Lantern Festival. Naturally, best viewed at night when all the lights come on to give a festive feel, and preferably come on a weekday night like tonight when the crowd is thinner. Even then, photobombers and inconsiderate photographers never fail to make their presence felt. Just grit your teeth and grin because it is inevitable that this iconic tourist attraction draws in the crowds.",,
,,Amazing!,5,,"This is a must visit when in Singapore! So intriguing and educative. I could spend a good few hours here! I was mesmerised by all the beautiful flowers, plants, trees and shrubs. Go and see the Cloud Forest! It鈥檚 amazing!",,
,,Very nice artificial gardens,4,,"Nice artificial gardens. Be sure to check out the music/light show in the evening. We didn't go into the buildings, but enjoyed the walks between these different gardens a lot.",,
,,Photoshoot,4,,I was there for a photo shoot session. It was a hot day and buzzing with plenty of tourists. I loved the evening light show. It was so romantic and colourful.,,
,,Spectacular,5,,"Absolutely magical. These gardens have to be visited during the day and at night when the lights are on to truly appreciate the beauty. Spotlessly clean, lots of places to grab a bite to eat or drink and lots of public toilets. Very safe location and great atmosphere. Lots of places to walk and get lost and feel like being miles away. Would definitely recommend visiting to all",,
,,Stunning,5,,"Visited gardens by the bay by pure accident. And what a beautiful one. The garden it self is free. And on a large scale. The park does provide a buggy across the gardens for a small fee. Three domes ..which do require entrance fee.
Gardens rhapsody is a nightly show 7:45pm and 8:45pm. Absolutely magnificent. And its free.",,
,,Amazing!,5,,"I was already enthralled at the entrance of the cloud forest. This place is a MUST-GO for tourists and even locals, for at least once in their lifetime. The price is so affordable and worth it! Brilliant upkeep!",,
,,Must Visit,5,,This is good place to be in enjoy both Flower and forest doms. Good place to be with family and friends,,
,,Beautiful garden everrrr,5,,"Lost the words, it's just BEAUTIFULLLLLL. Really large and many kind of garden, those tree pillars are gorgeous. Walking around is quite tired but amazing. You can spend at least half day here just doing photoshoot.",,
,,One of the highlights of our holiday.,5,,If ever you go to Singapore you must visit this place. It was the reason we came to Singapore. Absolutely breath taking. We Loved It. The light show was stunning as were the conservatories. We didn't see any animals as we went late and it rained so had to wait. By the time we had done the conservatories it was too late. Words can't describe how amazing it is. You must see it for yourself.,,
,,Lots of flowers,4,,"It is a beautiful garden in the middle of the city.
Come during nighttime and see the trees in the super garden with lights on. There is a music show as well, but it is a waste of time.

Instead try the cloud forest dome and walk to the top.
The flower dome had a lot of different flowers, but compared to the cloud forest, it is kind of disappointing.",,
,,Worth your time and the walking,5,,"This is simply a must do. We went at 3pm and enjoyed the Skyway, Cloudland and FlowerDome along with everything in between. Then we went to the rooftop restaurant at twilight and saw the lights come on over the city over a glass of wine. Then we enjoyed the light show. You really need to just lay on the ground and experience it, there is no better way. Don't be fooled thinking you need to see it from up high, just get there and see it! The Golden tree and pianos were other highlights. My mother wowed the crowd with her brilliant piano playing. Overall a brilliantt attraction.",,
,,A paradise garden within the city,4,,Huge in door garden to experience seasonal plants. It can be the tulip season to the orchid season. Just ensure you check on their website. Spend time during the night to also view the beautiful gigantic lamp trees.,,
,,Must Do!,5,,Really nicely done! Especially the Tree Walk is great!! Check the opening hours of the flower dome and cloud forest in advance.. they are sometimes closed for one day for maintenance.,,
,,Magical moment,5,,Went to see the laser show & felt like living a dream or am in AVATAR movie 馃挏this was so mesmerizing & you should not leave Singapore without visiting this beauty,,
,,Brilliant,5,,What an amazing place. The dome gardens are stunning and it was great to get out of the sun for a few hours. We planned it so that we would finish in time to watch the light show at the super tree grove. Our favourite thing to do in Singapore.,,
,,Interesting and beautiful,4,,"We arrived too late to go into one of the domes so we walked around. It's very beautiful, especially at night when the lights are on.",,
,,Gardens by the bay visit,4,,The visit to Cloud forest and flower dome was amazing.. Got my tickets online through Klook website. Had no ques. Unfortunately on the day we went it was raining so the OCBC Skyway was closed. Anyway this is a must place to visit.,,
,,Mid-Autumn Festival at the Gardens by the Bay (6 - 24 Sep 2018),4,,"Visit in the late evening and enjoy the sights of the lighted lanterns as the sky turns dark. Proceed to the Supertree Grove, find a place to sit or lie down, and enjoy the display of light and sound. After the light and sound show, admire the lighted up ""The Phoenix and the Peony"", which symbolizes nobility, harmony and affluence.
Visit the Flower Dome for themed garden settings, and the Cloud Forest where a waterfall and ""mountain"" cloaked in vegetation await you, or admire the views from the 22m-high Skyway.",,
,,Visit worth remembering,5,,"The few hours we spent here was probably the best time of our trip in Singapore. My wife was apprehensive when I suggested that we go to GBTB rather than shopping but once we reached there, her scowl disappeared completely and was replaced by the most wonderful smile and you can imagine how the rest of our day went. We spent couple of hours in each dome and marveled at the fact that Singapore was able to have such places of connect with the nature which we long for in our cities. All in all it was truly memorable.",,
,,Magical floral scape,5,,"In a time when concrete landscapes dominate our lives, these gardens provide a visual paradise. There are actually several indoor gardens, so it鈥檚 a respite from the tropical heat/humidity. Kids can run around in relative safely around the many pathways - but you鈥檒l have to watch them as this isn鈥檛 a 鈥淐huck E Cheese鈥? and there鈥檚 no tracking of them in these vast gardens.",,
,,Excellent and cool,5,,"Nice air conditioned place to walk around. Beautiful gardens, waterfall and a cafe with snacks and good coffee. Good value around $28 gets you into both domes.",,
,,YASSS,5,,"gr8 place to go I recommend this place coz of the flower dome and the cloud garden...don't forget your jackets, its chilly there...",,
,,Floral fans,3,,If you love nature and into flowers perhap u gonna love this place. Come between 5-8 pm so you can experience both during the day and night . Easy access by public transport . Use mrt .,,
,,A wonderful place to spend the afternoon.,5,,"So worth visiting, especially the indoor waterfall. Just highlights what can be achieved when there is agreement to create a serene and enchanting place for tourists and locals to enjoy. I would definitely recommend a visit.",,
,,Mesmerizingly beautiful,5,,"Mesmerizingly beautiful is how I would describe Gardens by the bay, however this will hardly do justice to the actual experience of the Flower Dome and the Cloud forest. A must see place when you visit Singapore. The OCBC skywalk is another amazing place to walk and take in the sights of Singapore and click lovely photos. Do make it a point to catch the evening shows (Garden Rhapsody) which is another beautiful experience in itself.",,
,,100% better than what i expected,5,,"Im by no means into gardens or the like but i loved it here. Very well designed, with lots and lots to see. Very good Air con inside so it will keep you very cool. I loved the walkway int eh cloud dome!",,
,,Mesmerizing,5,,Wonderful indoor garden especially the man-made waterfall. Knowledge about the importance of taking care our planet and its inhabitants are truly one of the most important aspect.,,
,,A must visit and free to enter too.,5,,"Fabulous tropical gardens maintained to a high standard. Don't miss the light shows at 7.45pm and 8.45pm. Visit the Cloud forest, flower dome and the sky way, whilst there. Get the MRT to Bayfront. Go through the Marina Bay Sands Hotel too, if you like.",,
,,Amazing exhibition,5,,We had half a day to spend during our layover flight in Singapore and decided to visit the 2 exhibitions - Forest and Flower. So spectacular the variety of orchids on display at the Flower Dome. while the waterfalls and the plants at the Forest Dome is truly fantastic.,,
,,International Immersion,5,,"The place is really clean, the attraction is worthy for taking photos. I like that there was a big aquarium located inside the garden and it has a lot of cactus small and big.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay - Cloud Forest & Flower Dome,5,,"For a less, hassle trip we booked our tickets ahead of time to avoid the long queue.The Cloud Forest & Flower Dome is Amazing!!! worth to visit when your in SG.",,
,,flower dome + cloud forest,5,,I have a wonderful memories with my mom and sister in both places. Although is very crowded but its worth to visit.,,
,,Cruise Immersion,5,,"This unique attraction in Singapore will surely take your breath away. It shocases how great the technology and innovation that the Singaporeans have. Also, this place is really a great spot to take IG worthy shots! Indeed there is no place like Singapore .",,
,,Interesting and educational,5,,"My family visited the gardens by the bay. It is a must place to visit during the day and night. The experience is totally different. A fair bit of walking but absolutely worth it. My family enjoyed the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome. The display of thousands of plants was spectacular and educational when we watch a clip on water preservation. At night, the garden is lit up and what a beautiful sight. A truly recommended place to visit.",,
,,Cloud Forest and Flower Dome,5,,"Both the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome is clean. Even though it was crowded, everyone moved in an orderly manner. Hence, making it a great experience.",,
,,Very bad experience,1,,"We took our daughters to the forest cloud, before entering the dome, we saw the queue time was about an hour. While we were queuing, one of my girls wanted to go bathroom, so we asked the staff about the bathroom location, and was told the bathroom was outside the dome. But if we leave the queue then we had to queue from the beginning. We had no choice but forced to leave the queue to take my girl to bathroom. Staff was not friendly enough to let us join back the queue. We had to restart all over again. So we left the place without visiting the forest cloud.",,
,,Flower Dome and Cloud Forest experience,5,,Simply Amazing!! I would love to go back and bring my husband and children soon! Singapore has done a great job!,,
,,The wonderful Gardens that must visited,5,,"I visited the gardens by the bay with my sister and friend. We have a wonderful experience, besides the place is clean, cool and well-maintained, We can also see many types of unique flowers directly and near. We will tell family and relatives about this wonderful experience. If there is another opportunity, we want to visit again. Successful greetings are always for the entire the gardens by the bay team who have worked hard to satisfy the visitors.",,
,,Amazing. A must see.,5,,Breathtaking gardens and a welcome break from the humidity. We went during the Wizard of Oz display. Fabulousness many different sunflowers. Had a great time. Will definitely be visiting again. Heard the light show at night is amazing,,
,,Must see place in Singapore,4,,"Gardens by bay has 3 main attractions. Indoor flower dome is well maintained and has variety of flowers across the world.Cloud forest has artificial waterfall and cloud walk way as main attractions. However OCBC walkway is really amazing. Whole place turns into a spectacular light garden during light and sound show in the evening !
Really amazing place !",,
,,Gardens by the bay,5,,"Excellent attraction! A Must visit when in Singapore, and both domes, especially the waterfall (Cloud Forest), which is truly amazing.",,
,,Avoid weekends!,5,,"Love going here when I go to the Marina Bay area. Highly recommend going during the off-peak - aka weekdays - to avoid the crowd. Great to see the flowers (tip: come on Thursdays or Wednesdays after they freshen up the flowers), and take beautiful pictures of the flowers and with the flowers.

Getting the annual pass is quite worth it because you get to see the different displays they have. Now they have the Wizard of Oz themed sunflower area. Very adorable! Not too sure what the inflatable sunflower is there for though...

If you're like me and get caught up in the flowers, the two domes can be a full day thing but I've been through the entire place once in 45 minutes. It can get a little chilly in the Cloud Forest Dome, so bring a jacket!",,
,,Like a sci fi scene,5,,Definitely worth a visit . Have a walk on the sky way 22 metres above ground . If you stay late then watch it he light show . Walking in the grounds is free but the to visit the domes will cost you not impressed with the first dome but The second dome was definitely worth seeing ! Can be very busy at weekends,,
,,Impressively large garden,5,,"The super trees are really fantastic. It's free to visit, tickets are for the domes only. Amazing place to have a walk and take photos. It's highly recommended.",,
,,A great attraction!,5,,"The gardens are massive with lots of different areas. The gardens themselves and the supertree groves are free to enter and roam around. We would recommend spending some money and entering the domes - very interesting, educational and impressive.
We are glad that we went back at night to see the light show, this was excellent but I would advise to get there early as it can be very busy.",,
,,Gardens,5,,"Near to marina bay , Gardens by the bay, Best time to spend in the night , Light show is amazing 馃槈 鉁?
,,A must see in Singapore,5.0,,Head to the Gardens just before sunset and stay for the amazing music and light show. The domes are amazing too.
,,Stunningly beautiful,5.0,,The garden are a treasure. The size and variety of the gardens are amazing. We spent all day and into the evening. The two main showcase venues are nothing short of breathtaking and cannot be missed.",,

,,Cruise Immersion,5,,Gardens by the Bay ! The place you'd surely come back for it's like you wanna own the place when you are here 鉂?100% recommendation for this,,
,,Evening out,5,,We all enjoyed our evening in the gardens by the bay. The light show is displayed twice a night and is worth planning your trip around these times. We enjoyed a wine and beer at the top of one of the trees and it cost about 拢12 each for he drink and the view well worth it.,,
,,Beautiful indoor and outdoor gardens,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is a very large nature park with both indoor and outdoor garden areas. The Supertree Grove in the outside area is very beautiful especially with its lights at night.
You need to buy a ticket to visit one of or both of the two conservatories. One is the Flower Dome, which has many beauitufl flowers inside. The other one is the Cloud Forest, in which you can walk up and inside the Cloud Mountain with a beautiful waterfall.",,
,,Great time for people of all ages,4,,"For a small country like Singapore, it has some of great attractions. Garden by the Bay is a great place to visit even for the locals. There are different areas in the garden that can be enjoy by people from all ages, it is a place for a family to spent a whole day.
Travelling there is not much of a hassle, if you travel by MRT, get off at MBS and walk over to Garden by the Bay. Or by taxi, the driver can drop you off right in front of the visitor centre.
Before you visit Garden by the Bay, you may want to do some research, as I noticed there are counters at the Singapore Airport that sell discounted tickets for most of the attractions.",,
,,"nice garden to walk in central area, free access to all",5,,"this is a big garden - friendly to visitors of all ages, with many trails and themed areas to explore (nicely designed even though man made). Better go in morning or late afternoon when weather is not that scorching hot. Like the magnificent Supertree Grove (can pay to go up to the OCBC Skyway). Signs are pretty clear, or you can ask the ground staffs for directions. Rainy weather is not good for this place since limited areas are sheltered. Calling in cabs can be challenging at times.
If have more time, can visit the flower dome (need entrance fee) which is a big greenhouse displacing plants and flowers from the Mediterranean region, or the Cloud Forest with strong aircon.",,
,,Peaceful escape in the Gardens and Cloud forest,5,,"This is one of the best things to see in Singapore, very well done inside and out. I would recommend booking in advance and printing off the ticket prior to arrival. Its a nice walk from the Bayfront MRT station. We went in early and the crowds were small which I think is worth it. You can walk straight into the cloud forrest, make sure to get your hand stamped and go back into the flower dome and enjoy a drink or snack at the Pollen cafe, the staff were excellent and friendly. Highly recommend doing this one.",,
,,Great gardens,5,,Awesome night lights display. A large LED light display set to music that is truly worth seeing. Two other great attractions under domes being the flower done and the mountain mist dome. The mountain mist display is especially well done and totally worth the visit.,,
,,We travelled far & wide ...,4,,"to get here, I don鈥檛 just mean the flight from the UK either. We got the shuttle from Changi Beach to Bugis Village, then a taxi to Marina Square Shopping Mall to collect our Ho Ho tickets, then got the Ho Ho to Gardens by the Bay, we were exhausted before we got here! We sought solace in McDonalds, thoroughly enjoyable it was too. After that we managed to limp around for a bit, however, the midday sun became all too much for us & it seemed like a good idea to hop on the Audio Tour for an $8 & 20 minute ride. We had every intention of returning, but we just didn鈥檛 get time. We did enjoy what we saw though.",,
,,They just do things well in Singapore,5,,Another must do attraction in Singapore. The giant trees are amazing and worth seeing both during the day and at night.,,
,,OK but can't say that it was really all that good,3,,The cost of taking a family (parents and 2 kids) would be quite prohibitive. We purchased discounted tickets (though only slightly cheaper) through KLOOK but cannot say that it was value for money really. Best time to visit is dusk to night time and the viewing of the Supertrees (synchronised to music) was the highlight of the visit. I reckon this and the OCBC skywalk are the two best options for the GBTB.,,
,,The evening night music and lights show,5,,"I was looking for something cheap to do and I read about this. Went there without any expectations but after the show, I was awed. The lights and the music was in sync and it was just amazing. Even without the show, the free portion of the gardens was beautiful.",,
,,airfare just to see,5,,Had a great day here. The main point of visit was to see the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. The gardens are free to wander around but entry to the two indoor domes was $A26. Both were set out in an amazing fashion with the splash of colousr from so many flowers to the mist and waterfall with so many orchids in flower was stunning. The outdoor tall trees are also not to be missed.,,
,,Garden By the bay,5,,"Truely one of the excellent destination and people must see or include in their Singapore itinerary.

Better to get there by taxi as it's entrance in remote area and try to be there by 1400-1500 so that after this you can reach Marina bay mall and one of its own kind and very beautiful light and sound show area along the river bay (Walkable) by 1800-1830 hrs.

Please do not miss the whole activities mentioned above till about 2030 hrs.",,
,,Light show is a must see!,5,,"definitely a must see, very impressive garden and the light show is spectacular. if you are in Singapore - this is a 100% must see attraction,",,
,,Amazing,5,,What to say!!!! The most beautiful botanical garden in the world according to me. A bit expensive entry but it is worth it for a marvel of engineering that combines architecture and nature. Wonderful indoor waterfalls. Definitely worth a visit if you are in Singapore,,
,,Your Singapore,5,,Singapore is the best country for me. It's just a small country but the most amazing place that I've know. They provide the best of the best places that you one and one of the amazing place is the Garden by the Bay.,,
,,Great gardens. Not well signposted though.,4,,Great gardens if you can find them as they are not well sign posted if you are walking towards these. We took a buggy round trip which was good. There is lots to do and see and you probably need a whole day to do it justice which unfortunately we did not have,,
,,wonderful day at the gardens by the bay!! so impressive,5,,"if you only have 1 place to go, this is it!! it is worth the money and time to immerse yourself in this beautiful garden. the 2 dromes houses a lot of plants and the waterfall inside it is just unbelievable beautiful. the skywalk is ok too. overall wonderful experience in this place. go for it.",,

,,GBTB,5,,Brilliant as usual. Well worth a visit. The two domes are beautiful as are the super trees and general gardens. Surprising that it all on reclaimed ocean. Had some airforce jets practising for the National Day while we were there.,,
,,Incredible,5,,"Absolutely blown away by this place. Visited the Rhapsody in Supertree Grove at night, which was jut incredible - wish we'd had time to see it more than once! Also visited the Flower and Cloud Domes - these are amazing. The effort that has gone into creating these masterpieces... the Flower Dome had an orchard display as well as all the usual gardens - I believe this display changes every now and then. But the Cloud Dome is what really blew me away - you walk in and are greeted by the huge waterfall, surrounded by mist and cool air and beautiful lush greenery everywhere. It's really something - absolutely worth the visit. Could have spent all day in there, easy.",,
,,Fantastic,5,,A must see. Got there late but still a worthwhile visit. Go at night for the 8 45 music and light show in the supergrove. It is a free show. The whole scene is very memorable. The other gardens are certainly worth a visit as well.,,
,,very pretty,5,,This was nice and relaxing we went in the evening which was cooler lovely gardens must visit while in Singapore,,
,,The Unbeliveable Man-made Garden,5,,One down! One of my bucket list 鈾ワ笍 It鈥檚 really amazing how they manage to create a garden like that. All of the view is perfect for instagrammable!,,

,,Very Good Experience,4,,"This is better than I expected. The two conservatories are cooled, which is great considering Singapore's warm climate. One of them has a large man-made waterfall, while the other has flowering plants and wood sculptures. Tickets for the conservatories are reasonably priced.

Outside, you get to see the giant Supertrees, which double as light show structures at night. You can just lie down on the cropped grass and enjoy the lights and the orchestral music during the showtimes. Lots of restaurants inside with a good variety of tasty fare.

This is a must-see spot if you are visiting Singapore.",,

The structure and architecture of bay of gardens is years ahead.

Make sure you visit the Satay by the bay for bloody amazing food at really cheap prices.",,

,,Free to visit,5,,Definitely the best thing to visit in Singapore. It鈥檚 free to walk around & then I just paid for a 20min buggy tour & a few other things.,,
,,Awesome gardens,5,,"My wife and I were keen to visit these gardens while in Singapore and we were not disappointed.
We visited all the usual areas and particularly liked the two domes. The quality and size of some of the plantings were unbelievable. The olive trees were huge and must be of great age.
The work that goes in to maintain this wonderful display is enormous I am sure. We thoroughly enjoyed it and will be back next time we're in Singapore.",,
,,Must see,5,,I am not into plant's but this place is a must see. You are best to do both conservatory and the walk around the structures.,,
,,WOW FACTOR,5,,This man made attraction is a credit to their creators. Well worth the entry fee to the two domes. The night laser show was excellent.,,
,,Treat for the kids,5,,"I've always love sunflower and this opportunity was not to be missed. I brought along my families to enjoy the new floral display which include Dorothy, scarecrow, tin man, etc. Enjoyed them in a cooled conservation of the Flower Dome was a bonus.

Words said a thousand words and I'm just going to leave with that.",,
,,Awesome,5,,"Whole day to be spent there, and make sure to experience the lights by the evening. Certainly worth your time. And not to be missed.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"Great place to walk around, so many things to see. Even if you don't want to pay the big bucks there's still lots to see. Instagrammers paradise.",,

,,Stunning,5,,"Beautiful gardens, loaded with with numerous interesting sculptures and artworks. Made even more stunning by the amazing Flower Dome and Cloud Forest, and the ever-so-cool Super Trees",,
,,Wonderful medley of nature and modern architecture,5,,"Price maybe a little steep but it cost a lot to maintain a huge greenhouse like this in humid Singapore. In my opinion, a must see for tourists and locals. I bring my friends here all the time when they visit and they all left awestruck. If you're travelling on a budget or do not have sufficient time for both domes, I would definitely recommend checking out Cloud Forest dome before strolling around the supertrees. They have a light show at night and plenty of concerts and events going on in the evening so mark your calendar. Parking can be difficult especially during public holidays but not to worry, there is a train station nearby. They put up Christmas lights in December and for a small fee, you can visit and get in the festive mood",,
,,"Wow, even better at night when lit up",5,,"We visited during the day, and went to the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. The Gardens are mightily impressive. At the time the weather wasn鈥檛 the best so the walk way was closed; but it looks good.

If you were short on time, go at night time, it鈥檚 the best time IMO.",,

,,"Amazing love,love,love",5,,"For me Gardens by the Bay was the highlight of our trip to Singapore! We loved it! We visited once in the day and the actual gardens were lovely really nice and peaceful in the very busy city. We went in the flower dome and it was fabulous! We are by no means gardeners but even we could appreciate all the work that had gone into the displays and the layout- it was truly beautiful. We went up on the skywalk and the view was stunning you could see the entire gardens. Was a perfect photo opportunity! Unfortunately the cloud dome was closed for refurb but the rest of the gardens were so amazing i didnt feel it subtracted from our day!
We visited the second time at night and we were so so so pleased we went back the light show on the skywalk was amazing and it really breathtaking! We watched it for an hour and i felt like we could have watched it for ages!
The gardens really summed up our visit to Singapore! Not to be missed!",,
,,Singapore highlights x 3,4,,"Great to do all three items on the wish list in one tour.
Gardens By The Bay light show was spectacular!
Marinara Bay Hotel Observation deck was wonderful. Needed more time up here!!
Beware the elevator queues 10_20 min wait each way.
River cruise was also very good but short.
Tour director needs a microphone because most of us couldn't hear her on many occasions.",,
,,Great for a half day stroll,5,,"We combined our visit with early breakfast at the top of marina bay sands. Just walk through the underpass and you get to the Gardens by the Bay.

The gardens really showcase malasian/asian fauna, combining multiple themed gardens with interesting, informative boards. The japanese garden was particularly beautiful. The midday heat can be sheltered from beneath the trees and several covered walkways for much of the route.",,
,,Sightseeing Singspore,5,,"Great amazing experience, go in the morning, less people to enjoy location. Take the hop on hop off bus which stop in front of Bay Sands Hotel, take elevator up and walk across bridge walkway. Stunning views from there..",,

Gardens by the Bay is one such unique creation.
There are paid gardens where flowers and plants from around the world can be seen in naturally air cooled environment - again a unique experience. There are several themed flower domes within the Gardens.
There are also ponds and fountains and walk paths, cycling paths, skate paths along the bay.
There are several restaurants all over the Gardens including a Hawker Centre which is called Satay by the Bay.
There is a large park area where shows and entertainment takes place regularly especially during festivals.
During Christmas one can enjoy a Snow fall amongst lights and entertainment. Admission is free in all zones except Domes.
For children there is a unique play area with water play area as well which is very popular. It is free.
Singapore has no end to free entertainment for one and all.
Plan a visit soon.",,
,,Night Tour,5,,"Excellent, simply amazing, loved the food they had on offer before the show commenced, it was just magical",,
,,A must see while in Singapore,5,,"It鈥檚 easy to spend hours wandering through the spectacular gardens at Gardens by the Bay. The Flower Dome and Cloud Forrest are well worth the admission fees (28 SGD for a ticket to the 2 conservatories). The Cloud Forrest, with the largest indoor waterfall, is an engineering feat to be admired. Garden Rhapsody, the light and music show, in Supertree Grove is spectacular, and even better, it is free!",,
,,Stunning Place,5,,Gardens By the Bay is truly an amazing beautiful place to visit in Singapore. Gardens By the Bay is a must to do if you are in Singapore you will be mesmerised by the amazing light show.,,
,,So Beautiful,5,,"We visited Gardens by the Bay twice this week, one is at day time, another is at night. Both are so beautiful! There is free light show at 7:45pm at the super tree grove area, the music and lights are really beautiful!",,
,,Awesome,5,,"Well worth a visit- the work, planning and construction of this must have been amazing! Very well laid out and quite a relief to walk in there and discover it was quite cool. We visited the flower dome first then the cloud forest which is a good order to do them in. Impressive in every aspect and very interesting to also walk around the outside gardens and over to Marina Bay Sands hotel.",,
,,Relax stroll after meal,5,,"All the good things about Gardens by the Bay
- No entrance fee to the park, but have to pay for the flower dome
- different themes during different festive seasons
- lighting formation at the right interval, just after dinner
- a place just nice for a relaxing stroll after dinner
- spacious and won't feel the crowd even though there are many people",,
,,Wonderful day out,5,,"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands so got free entry to the park. We bought tickets from Groupon for the Cloud and Flower Domes, and the Skywalk (all 3 were worth doing). The tranquility of the gardens, coupled with their beauty, makes for a lovely day out. Not one for heights I did have to hang on to the handrail round the Skywalk but the views made it worthwhile! If you want to slow your pace down for a while during your stay in Singapore, I鈥檇 recommend a visit to these gardens.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"Absolutely amazing, and I鈥檓 not the biggest fan of nature. The cloud forest is definitely the highlight of it, which costs around 拢10 each (I think!). Not bad for a unforgettable experience. Beautiful views of marina bay sands from there too. I recommend going in the daytime, then returning around 10pm, as there are little to no tourists around at that time.",,
,,A MUST VISIT,5,,We found a visit just before dusk enables you to catch the beauty of the gardens and as darkness settles in allows you to enjoy the wonderful light show. Highly recommended.,,
,,Stunning! A must do!,5,,Absolutely gorgeous you could spend days there and it鈥檚 free - the cloud forest and flower garden you have to pay for but the gardens are free!,,
,,Lovely and cool inside,5,,On a hot day when you don't have plans it's nice to get inside one of the two domes. Even after the fairly long walk it's great to cool off inside and enjoy a bit of nature. The waterfall is quite spectacular also.,,
,,Fantastic Attraction - a 鈥渕ust see鈥?in Singapore!!,5,,"First off, if your planning to visit the Gardens by the Bay, make sure you plan to spend the whole day. The place is simply amazing, a huge expanse of gardens, flowers, waterfalls, all set amidst superb architecture. We visited only two of the areas in the Gardens- The Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome. These took us over two hours.
The Cloud Forest contains the highest man made waterfall in the world, filled with beautiful flowers, little niches of rare and unique planting鈥檚. The structure also has a maze of walkways that take you high above the ground level and up a 鈥榤ountain side鈥?filled with a riot of colourful blosoms , creepers and ferns.
The Flower Dome is filled with an amazing selection of 鈥榞ardens鈥?from various parts of the world and contain authentic plants from that country, like Australian garden, African garden etc. The abundance of orchids , their varied hues, shapes and sizes are a real treat for the eyes. AND don鈥檛 forget your camera, or make sure your mobile has plenty of memory left because the photo opportunities are endless and simply beautiful.
Before you go, take the time to check our various options for buying your tickets, there are many many offerings, i suggest you choose one with at least a hotel pickup so you save on the transport but leave on your own as this will give you time to enjoy the venue without being hurried along by a guide or a schedule. Highly recommended and a sure to enjoy place that left us feeling happy, satiated and genuine 鈥榝lower people鈥?!",,
,,Amazing,5,,Well worth to visit. So many beautiful flowers. Cloud dome was perfect. This place is highly recomended.,,

,,So beautiful to visit,5,,"We again returned to the gardens, this time we toured the ""Cloud Dome,"" so much to enjoy and take in about Mother Nature."" The Orchids were all in bloom, so pretty. So much to see, the gardens and water features are so enjoyable. We have been here at night time on previous occasions and look forward to returning on our next visit to Singapore.",,
,,Mixing business with pleasure,5,,We had booked a restaurant here for a business meeting which allowed us to get a free entry into this as well. The visit was worth it with exotic plant species from various nooks and corners of the globe.,,
,,A must-visit whether you're a tourist or local.,5,,Carefully curated foliage and modern architecture makes for a picturesque trip. Highly recommend the skywalk and the domes (cooled conservatories),,
,,Great light show,5,,Well worth a night visit to the Gardens by the Bay to watch the fantastic light show. There is plenty to do in the are.,,
,,Most forest,3,,Though built with a lot of conviction the place is only good for people who live in Singapore. Being from a country like India with so much of REAL wildlife and waterfall and plants it did not impress me one bit as most of the plants shown are artificial. Yes some good replica are there like that of rafflesia Venus flytrap but I was not n impressed. I must say I did not visit gardens due to shortage of time but this was was ordinary and if misssed nothing that you should regret.,,
,,Absolutely stunning,5,,"Both domes are beautiful and a pleasure to walk through. The Supertrees are amazing as well, especially at night. It was great to learn that the Gardens are powered by solar power and that rainwater is used for watering.The info center at the end of the Cloud Forest is well done and such an important message to all of us.",,
,,Where modern mankind enjoys the 鈥渨ilderness鈥?5.0,,"This is a gorgeous compound of gardens. All are handcrafted and beautifully put together. Where modern people can enjoy and understand a bit of the tropical rainforests fauna without the inconvenience of real rainforest that is humidity, insects, and actual physical endurance.",,,
,,Beautiful way to spend the day!!,5,,"Be prepared to walk alot, but it's worth it. There so much beauty in this place, and visiting the domes will get you out of the heat. Just take it all in as you go through it!!",,
,,Gardens by the Bay was fun,5,,"Definitely something to check out if you are in Singapore.. it was beautiful, fun and entertaining. We spent a few hours checking out the area and would definitely go back.",,
,,Nighttime stunner,5,,"Such a beautiful and spectacular sight in Singapore, set to dramatic music, mesmerising. Just below Marina Bay Sands.",,
,,"Great way to spend the day, and beat the heat!",5,,"Brought a group here for a school trip. We were all excited for the skybridge and that part did not disappoint. Great views and excellent photo opp. However, the domes and cloud forest were surprisingly spectacular. The indoor mountain and waterfall in the cloud forest dome were incredible! Almost has a Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory feel to it. I recommend buying the tickets that include all three. (two domes and tree skybridge)",,
,,Must visit in Singapore,5,,Gardens by the bay is must visit place in Singapore. Singapore trip not complete without visit to this place,,
,,"Star Wars!! WoW!! Sorry, I got carried away.",5,,"Remember the Star Wars scene with the little furry creatures living in the trees. This is the scene you get when you visit this remarkable place. Do visit at dusk/night, because you will love it. Kids and adults alike really like this adventure. The Gardens by the Bay is a futuristic place that you will come to love. You can also see the breath taking picturesque backdrop of the Sentosa Sands Resort. Once inside you tend to just wonder, wonder and wonder.....selfie, selfie, selfie.... but a romantic stroll here is just Ssweet!! You might get a glimpse of a wedding couple or two, if you are lucky. The Garden is a not to miss kind of adventure. Don't take my word for it, just ask the locals.",,
,,Breath-taking,5,,"Wow, wow, wow! We heard this was good but we were blown away.
We spent the $28 each to visit both the Flower Conservatory and the Cloud Forest and it was worth every cent. An amazing feat of design, engineering and botany.
We didn't bother with the sky walk (there was plenty of high walks in the Cloud Forest) but we did spend the $8 each for the Audio Tour which is a little bus which gives you a tour of the outside gardens and a bit of an overview. You could truly spend all day there. A cook little water park for the kids too.

Best MRT (rail) station is **Bayfront**.

$3 each for the shuttle from there to the ticket office/information centre.",,
,,Lovely,4,,You will likely walk your feet off but the gardens are worth a day visit and a night return to see the lights. Very enjoyable.,,
,,Well worth a visit,5,,"Spent a fantastic afternoon in the Gardens by the Bay. I'm not into flowers or plants at all, but this place is amazing and well worth the entry fee.",,
,,Marvelous,5,,Couldn't stop wondering at the man made marvel created at Gardens by the Bay. Cloud forest and Flower Dome are fantastic. The best part is the Supertree Grove during night.,,
,,Wizard of Oz,5,,Amazing display! Always love the flower display and was surprised with the sunflowers. Lovely place and good to go on a weekday so that you can take selfies otherwise it is normally crowded on weekends.,,
,,Next-Level Attraction,5,,"Gardens by the Bay reminds me of Dubai - and how Dubai is always innovating their next attraction. Well, Singapore is 1-up on Dubai - because the Gardens by the Bay was incredible. You can see most of the gardens from the ground - at no cost - however to take advantage of the skyway and other services, there is a cost. And, be forewarned - it is CROWDED!! And, the walk over from the MBS Hotel is also a bit chaotic (but so worth it).",,
,,A must see,5,,We go here each trip to Singapore. Always lovely just to walk around. Went to the Cloud Dome this time as well. Saving the Flower Dome for next trip,,
,,Great experience,5,,Only a word: wonderfoul ! a unique experience that you can not miss if you are in Singapore.plants and flowers from all over the world,,

,,Great day,5,,"Amazing walking through the gardens by the bay, and especially the cloud forest is impressive. Recommend going at night. Not so busy and with the lights it is great to see.",,
,,Simply stunning - and the supertrees light display is free,5,,"We only had an evening to spend wandering around Gardens By The Bay (GBTB) and managed to be on time for the light display at 7.45pm (there is also one at 8.45). Yes, you are elbow to elbow with hundreds /thousands but is it worth it? Oh yes. The super trees are out of this world and with a beautiful light display, it is completely different to anything I have seen before. And the best bit? It is free (always useful for a family of 5)!!!",,
,,Breathe of Fresh Air,5,,"A must go to place for people who needs a little breather. Both the domes are fully air conditioned and very organized. It鈥檚 recommended for plant enthusiasts. The negative side of it is sometimes it get鈥檚 a litte crowded especially on the weekends, but overall I had a great time! And oh don鈥檛 forget to go there at the late afternoon, sunsets there gives a little shine on your pictures plus you get to experience the Supertrees at night with all it鈥檚 gorgeous lights!",,
,,Gardens By The Bay,5,,"The gardens are so beautiful. This year we visited the Flower Dome too. It's amazing and not to be missed. As for food, Satay By The Bay is a must. Delicious and oh so cheap",,

,,A MUST visit in Singapore,5,,"A very nice place to spend a day here. Flower Dome, Cloud Forest, OCBC Walk... etc.
The most interesting is the waterfall in Cloud Forest, amazing. Buy package tickets so you can visit all of them. The best time visit here is at around 5pm so you can enjoy the day scenery, night with lighting and the light show.",,
,,Sky Garden is a must!,4,,Sky Garden was amazing! Pictures just don't do it justice but you keep snapping away. Was a lovely way to start our Singapore holiday.,,

,,Flower Dome & Cloud Forest (Beautiful Wonders),5,,A really good and an eye opener for a beautiful man made wonderful nature! The temperature is chilly good especially for a warm weather in Singapore that we are able to enjoy the great scenery. Fantastic and a job well done to maintain the high class place of attraction!,,
,,What a day and even better at night,5,,"We took the tour of the two mail displays and were very surprised with the amount of work put into the displays. Fantastic to see. More photos than the better homes and garden magazine has taken so a must for the gardener. You must stay for the night time light show as this too is something to be seen. I was also taken back by the level of self sufficiency of the park by using green waste, solar power and collection of rain water to reduce the running cost and help the environment.",,
,,Botanical Garden meets Disneyland,5,,"Gardens by the Bay in some ways is typical Singapore: clean & safe, entertaining and surprising.

Built on reclaimed land (as is 25% of Singapore), there is probably something for everyone.

We walked over in the elevated walkway from the Marina Bay Sands side and took the shuttle to the flower & cloud domes.

We only spent 2 or 3 hours but you could very easily send the whole day and ha,f the night, if you have the stamina.

This is an entertainment venue, that is built around a garden theme. If you want pure garden, go to the wonderful World Heritage listed Singapore Botanical Gardens. Or, if you are like us, do both!",,
,,Well worth a visit...,5,,"Really nice place to visit, went with two teenage boys who enjoyed it.!!! Well worth the small cover charge to go up and walk along the rope bridge for amazing views.",,
,,New tech Garden,5,,New technology used in the recycling of water with huge structures to implement recycling to vast area. You will be amazed at the great effort expanded by the Singapore Government to implement and showcase the recycling of rainwater and how water is been used again in this vast area. Really mind boggling when you realise the massive plan and effort to implement. Kudos to the Sinagapore Government/,,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,"Visited these amazing gardens. Absolutely fabulous attraction. The varieties and displays were almost unbelievable, such colours and d sign. Go see it, if you don't you will have missed out on the experience of a lifetime. Stunning",,
,,Absolutely loved it,5,,The theme when I went was Orchids but think it wouldn鈥檛 matter what it was it would be great. There鈥檚 not only plants but sculptures and statues- all kinds of themes. You can spend hours there and keep seeing things you didn鈥檛 notice the first time you looked.,,
,,Mandatory while in Singapore,5,,"As mentioned in the title, you must visit this iconic place while staying in sgp. Amazing places and things to see, unreal atmosphere.. Better buy tickets online for both domes in order to get discount.",,
,,Super,5,,Great place to visit... A remarkable job. A must palce to visit. Explantion for the natural air conditioning in side the domes were great...,,
,,Not Cheesey and Very Easy,5,,"Went to the Light Show at The Gardens by the Bay 3 nights ago. I acquiesced to my bride who wanted to see the show, so we hopped on the MRT from Raffles City and were there in a few minutes. The place was packed as we walked through the towering 鈥渢rees鈥? The lighting dimmed and we sat on the ground (read: concrete) as the music came on. It was great!!! Very well orchestrated, a bit uncomfortable (so go early) but well worth the effort!!!!",,
,,Must-see in Singapore!,5,,"One of my highlights of Singapore without a doubt. You can walk around the gardens for free which will take ~1 hr, the Conservatories will take a good few hours to walk around properly, while the Skywalk is literally a 2 min walk amongst the Supergrove Trees. Tip: start queuing to get into the Skywalk around 7.15pm so the evening light show starts while you're at the top - this was definitely incredible to experience the trees lighting up all around you with the gorgeous view of the SG skyline in the background!",,
,,Be sure not to miss the Skywalk at the falling of night!,5,,"This place is lovely. A must see when you are in Singapore. The entrance to the gardens is free, but if you want to enter the Cloud Forest Dome and the Flower Dome you must pay. Do pay as it is not expensive and it is worth the visit! It is beautiful. But what you certainly cannot miss is the Skywalk. Make sure you are there right before nightfall, then the lights go on and the view is amazing. At around 19:45 there is also a lightshow with music so if you can attend at that moment, go for it!",,
,,Garden Lover Must Visit,5,,Located in easy accesible with public transport is a plus. With so many green attraction made this visit is so pleasent for the eyes. For mid day as its hot day I prefer stayed in the doom. Been visited during tullipmania and Cherry Blossom. Very beautiful. Ended by Satay by the Bay for our dinner.,,
,,Lovely place,5,,"Going here was a must when we booked to come to Singapore!

We visited twice (once on an evening to see the super trees lit up and once on a morning to have a wander round and visit the domes).

General entry to Gardens by the Bay is free - it鈥檚 a lovely place to walk around on an evening and watch the light show. Definitely recommend doing this. You can pay extra to walk around higher up the super trees but to be honest we never done this as from speaking to people they said views from the ground were much better. Views didn鈥檛 definitely not disappoint!

Make sure you take water and dress light as it鈥檚 very busy and was really hot when we visited both times.

On the second trip we took to visit the domes, again it was very busy but was nice to walk around to see what it was like during the day. Visit the domes if you have time (however probably wouldn鈥檛 rush to go back to the domes). You need to pay to enter these but nice to go in from a break from the warm weather as they are both air conned. Preferred the cloud forest out of the two as had a fantastic indoor waterfall.

Overall would definitely advise taking a trip to Gardens by the Bay - I suggest it is better on an evening when the trees are lit up. Go to the domes if you need time to fill or want to wander somewhere cool inside.",,
,,Certainly a Highlight,5,,It is certainly a garden with a difference. And not just a man made structure but one that integrates with power and water. The light show (12 minutes in duration) is certainly worth the planning to be there. Also try to plan so you can see both the gardens show and the nearby water light show immediately afterwards.,,
,,Lovely,5,,"I鈥檝e been here before. Panicking that I have to buy tickets early, that there will be a gazillion people etc.
well for the second time, we just strolled in, not huge crowds, and surprised ( not this time) to see that there is PLENTY to see apart from going in the domes and skywalk, and paying lots of money. Actually it鈥檚 not too expensive.. but if you are on a tight budget, just stroll and admire all the free gardens and areas..
I would make it a day trip by the bay.. bus to Marina Bay Sands in the morning and have a stroll , then back over the walkway to the shopping centre and viewing platforms.. there鈥檚 a rail station underneath that will take you anywhere cheaply.. good day out. Doesn鈥檛 need to be expensive..",,
,,Amazing escape space in a city,5,,"It's a architectural wonder unique to singapore. The cloud forest remind me of the castle in the sky animation, it's beautiful and refreshing. A definite must see if you are visiting singapore.

Tips I received from taxi driver, avoid going there in mid day, best timing is late evening, it's cooler and if you stay long enough you will catch the night scenery of the surrendering.",,
,,Beatiful Gardens,5,,"Beautiful gardens to walk around. If you go at night time you will get to see the wonderful lights of the ""Super Trees"". It looks like something from the movie Avatar and is very beautiful.",,
,,Amazing,5,,Nice place to spend evening when the lights come on..peaceful and beautiful place to spend with your loved one...nice view of marina bay sands hotel from this place.,,
,,Must go if you love plants,5,,It is a nice place to stroll along inside the domes of flowers and forest. You can see many interesting flowers from other corners of the world.,,
,,A must see,5,,"A good time to visit is around 3pm, we then went over to marina sands shopping mall for dinner and then back to the gardens for the light show at 7.45pm. Gardens worth seeing day and night. Just spectacular.",,
,,Beautiful Area!,5,,A must do in Singpore! Beautiful gardens for an leisurely walk. The domes are worth the entrance fee. This whole are is a must do in both the day and night times.,,
,,A nice Greenhouse,5,,"We visited the domes at Gardens at the Bay. The outdoor ""trees"" we found to be more or less - rather more - being steel structures of little aesthetic value, nor botanic value. They do come to live though at night.

We entered the Mist Dome first. What a refreshing experience in Singapore climate. One is welcomed by a quite high waterfall and water does splash upon one. Passing it one takes the lift to the top of the mountain and makes its way down through a great display of green and moisture loving plants.

It is indeed a great walk through the misty forest - even more when one has the luck to see the mist devices being in action which we did not.

We utterly enjoyed this dome.

The flower dome is unexpectedly refreshing too. The flowers are nice but cannot compete with the disaply in the National Orchid Garden in Singapores Botantic Garden. Still, it is again a great experience. The Cacti are quite impressive too but unfortunately non of them were blossoiming - which would have been great.

The domes are highly recommended to visit and will be pleasing to the eye as well as refreshing the body.",,
,,Perfect programme for the afternoon,4,,"Behind Marina Bay Sands, there lays a spectacular garden that partially symbolizes Singapore!s image outside of Asia. The glowing trees combined with the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest offers a perfect afternoon programme to couples, families or solo travelers. Don't miss the evening light shows!",,
,,Spectacular Gardens,5,,"Truly unique gardens with 2 climate controlled domes that feature plants from across the globe.
The Cloud Forest was my favourite. A lift takes you up 6 levels then you walk up a flight of stairs to the top of the dome. A series of walkways around the outside of a central structure and escalators takes you back down to the ground level.
Breathtaking scenery on the outside and areas inside the structure that focus on conservation and green living.
A must do when you visit Gardens by the Bay.
The nightly light show in the Supertree Grove is also a must do.

Vertical gardens measuring 25-50 meters in height that have canopies come alight with a spectacular light and sound show.

The light show is free but access to the Supertrees OCBC skywalk is
not. For those with vertigo or fear of heights not so good but the view up there is incredible!",,
,,Day trip in Singapore,4,,This was a great place to visit and see the gardens. Afterward we went to spago to watch the sunset and see the lights in the park.,,
,,amazing light show!!,5,,"Would 100% recommend the Garden by the Bay light show, all done to opera music and such a great show. Get there a little before the show starts to ensure a good spot!",,
,,Best place in Singapore,5,,"Gardens by the bay is one of the best places to visit in Singapore
The rich fauna is not only pleasing tothe eyes but is very educational as well
Main concept is Flowers and plants are kept in cooked glass house.
There is an entrance fees of about S$ 28 for foreigners.this fees covers the two main attractions Cloud forest and flower dome.
Do wear your walking shoes and take strollers along if toddlers are going with you.",,
,,"Amazing, futuristic",4,,"I've visited the Gardens by the Bay twice. The facility is made up of two domes and expansive outdoor gardens that include the ""super trees"". I appreciate that the outdoor portion of the facility is free. You can choose to visit one dome or two. The Cloud Forest is stunning. It's hard to describe until you visit, but I can't imagine anyone not being impressed. The Flower Dome is also gorgeous but I would recommend checking online to see what special installation is in progress. On my first visit, the installation was an amazing explosion of orchids. They offered free, educational walks that were excellent. The second time I visited, they were in the process of setting up for their next exhibit (Cherry Blossoms from Japan). While the special exhibit space is only one part of the whole flower dome, I personally wouldn't have paid to enter this section a second time if I had know it was in setup (and the ticket vendors do not inform you of this).",,
,,Splendid night visit,5,,"If you can鈥檛 stand the hot day sun shine, it will be better if you go at a chilled night walking around the Gardens by the Bay. Fresh air and chilled wine. Fit for couples, family and friends.",,
,,Unlike anything I have ever seen,5,,"This is like stepping into the future.
Singapore is so far ahead of the rest of the world when it comes to nature and this is the best example.
The Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are equally magnificent and the Sky Walk is incredible.
Try and visit the skywalk during sunset, be careful though as the queue will getting quite big just before and you鈥檙e only supposed to have 15 minutes at the top so you鈥檒l have to time it just right.
Hand around until 19:45 when they have a light and music show around the Supertrees that is not to be missed.
This is an absolute must whilst in Singapore.",,
,,What a great place to visit,5,,"This is a real amazing place which you have to see when visiting Singapore. I would also suggest going to the beautiful show with the super trees! Get there on time because it can be busy, but it鈥檚 worth it.
Also the domes are nice to visit as it has a huge variety of trees, flowers and plants.",,
,,Great way to spend a few hours in Singapore,5,,"The gardens are really amazing. Whilst slightly expensive ($34AUD for a dual pass which also include the Cloud Forest, but everything in Singapore is expensive), they are extremely impressive and it's a welcome way to spend some time to escape the heat!
Go early (before 1pm definitely helps) to avoid larger crowds.",,
,,Relaxing walk (only if you van stand the heat),4,,Great nature built in the centre of the city. Great use if space and greenery. The walk to it however is pretty hot so if you can't stand the heat you may like to go earlier in the day to avoid the heat. Worth the walk.,,
,,Great attraction,5,,"Took some friends that were visiting in town to gardens by the bay. Was truly amazed by the scenery, the different attractions and the walkways!",,
,,Hours breezed through without you realising it,5,,"Arrived at the Gardens at about 11AM Saturday, and spent almost the whole day there. I would highly recommend renting the audio guide before entering both Flower Dome and Cloud Forest and download the mobile apps as you pace through the beautiful gardens and landscapes.

Stayed around until 8PM+ to catch the Garden Rhapsody show. The Garden has a lot of restaurants, cafes and benches, making it very easy for anyone to spend the whole day there enjoying its beauty and hopefully learn a thing or two.",,
,,The place to be,4,,Nice place that needs to be visited at singapore. That's really Singapore. You have public transport to go and some restaurants to eat on site.,,
,,Beautiful,5,,We have nothing but admiration for this place. It was so beautiful and very clean. We went here 3 times and I never got tired of this place.,,
,,Beautiful place in Singapore,5,,"We visited the gardens, relaxing calming place to spend some time in even with lots of people doing the same thing. The giant trees are amazing. We went to the cloud garden which in the warm weather is very cool. Would have like to spend more time there.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,"This is a 鈥渕ust see鈥?when visiting Singapore. We caught the lift to the top and slowly wandered down the ramp, stopping to admire the plants. It is an amazing array of botanical beauty! A magical experience!",,
,,Stunning,5,,"The Gardens are amazing and definitely worth a visit, it is busy so allow plenty of time to wander. Go back at night for the light and music shiow as it is stunning!",,
,,Man made marvel,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is man-made. But in Singapore style, it is very well-made and maintained even better. The Childrens play area is amazing and you can spend hours there with the kids. Food options could be better but what they have is pretty good. The two domes are also interesting too! A must visit if you are in Singapore.",,
,,Best place in Singapore for plant-lovers without the mosquito bites!,5,,"Always been my favourite place in Singapore. It boasts two wonderful domes filled with flowers and plants! Exhibits change every few months so don鈥檛 forget your annual pass, or maybe plan your trip around the time they鈥檙e having an exhibit of your choice!

However, it鈥檚 best if you visit the place within the first 3/4 of its exhibit time because flowers tend to wither and fall off later into the exhibitions naturally. And you鈥檒l have a harder time getting your perfect shot.

The walk around the domes can get your pretty hungry. When that happens, head further into GBTB and you鈥檒l find Satay by The Bay, a huges hawker centre that has almost every Asian food you can think of.",,
,,A must do in Singapore fantastic raingarden experience,5,,"In this fantastic raingarden the flowers and plants live from the moisture in the glas Building. Plants are growing on a huge wall , 6 floors high and everywhere are orchids. You can take a lift to the 6th flore and walk down and see the fantastic nature from all sides and have also breathtaking views over the city through the glas of the builiding. It feels like in the rain forest. This is one spit not to miss in this city.",,
,,Must Visit,4,,"A must visit when you travel to Singapore, its a beautiful indoor garden and be amazed by the architectural design of the Dome. I would recommend that the best time to visit is during the late afternoon then proceed to the Cloud Forest.",,
,,Must visit at Singapore,5,,"We focused on the two doms, Cloud forest and flowers dome.
We purchaed tickets for both.
The Cloud Forest is the most reccomended.
Then at 19:45 there is a lights and music show on the super flowers, amazing.
I reccomend to go directly to the doms with shuttle to save your strength, and spend the hot hours in the doms as they have air condition.
Highly reccomended !",,
,,We spent a whole day here,5,,This is a must-see if you visit Singapore. But don鈥檛 go if you really don鈥檛 like flowers. I love flowers and the whole construction is beautiful. It鈥檚 so much more than just plants. It鈥檚 the way the whole thing is built.,,
,,Gardens by the bay,5,,"One of the best place for watching ,Must visit Garden by the Bay it's unique place. Worth to watch it.",,
,,The day before the orchid display started,5,,We managed to time our visit to Gardens by the Bay the day before the orchid display started. In a way that was lucky. The orchids were out but the anticipated big crowds weren鈥檛. This attraction HUGE in so many ways. The gardens themselves are huge. The mountain inside is massive and a cool feature. The plant displays are interesting and perfectly presented. The glass houses are amazing structures. It鈥檚 a fabulous place and you can spend as much or as little time and money as you want.,,
,,So cool !,5,,Walking in these gardens is like being in another world - they are cooled and the plant life is amazing. You are always conscious of how hot it is outside and how pleasant it is inside. Take an afternoon to stroll around and it will feel like you are somewhere else in the world until you come outside and realise it was like a dream !,,
,,Extraordinary,5,,We went in the Cloud - amazing It is a fantastic thing to do when in Singapore. It is truly incredible.,,
,,Spectacular- worth a lengthy visit,5,,"The gardens have many discreet areas, all marvellous. I'm not a gardener, but was constantly overwhelmed by the beauty, colour and sometimes humour of these Gardens. We spent 4 hours here and didn't see everything. The night light shows was spectacular with the orchestral music playing.",,
,,Breathtaking,5,,Mind was blown by what has been created. The gardens themselves are beautiful and we loved strolling through but then going through Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. To top it all the music and light show in the evening is simply spectacular and has to be done.,,
,,Great place!,5,,Fantastic place to easily spend one day with young children. Good service and good food. Nice activities for the whole family.,,
,,A must if you are in Singapore,5,,I loved this and I'm not normally a 'garden person'. Time it so you are there for the light show in the evening. Ideally give yourself 2-3 hours during the daylight and then be there for one of the evening light shows.,,
,,Great experience,5,,I loved the light show at the end it was sooo beautiful and the flower dome and waterfall dome were surprisingly AMAZING.you should definitely go there!!,,
,,Lovely,5,,"Gardens by the bay is great place to be in Singapore.
I love to go there after 4 pm usually. There are different kinds of plants in surrounding with their history displayed.
Gardens by the Bay is engineering marvel - they have special deck connected with trees so one can go from point A to point Z and can have a great view of MBS , surroundings .
Best place for families , exercise and some fun time.
Highly recommended for travelers.
Love Singapore",,
,,An absolute must.,5,,"This is something you have to do if you are in Singapore.Put a whole day aside you will need it to do it justice. The 2 indoor garden's are beautifully cared for and absolutely spectacular still leaving plenty to do and see outside. Don't forget the light show in the vertical gardens during the evening, it's world class.",,
,,Night Show Brilliant!,4,,Spent a good morning at the Gardens. Very busy with a few school groups also visiting at the same time. Staff appeared very professional and the place was well organised. Went back at night to experience the trees and the lights - amazing to see and gully recommend.,,
,,Must see location day and night,5,,A great place to visit both day and night with so much to see - the domes are both very unique and the solar tree light and music display at night is amazing - we found it easy to get to by both train and walking.,,
,,A must see while in Singapore,5,,"These gardens are a must to see.. They are fantastic and it is also worthwhile to pay the money to see the gardens under the domes - Flower Dome and the Gardens in the Clouds, both well worth while.",,
,,Such a surreal place to be,5,,It was an amazing experience there. It was bit too much crowded specially at some photo zones. But it is definitely must-visit place if you are in Singapore!,,
,,Evening Flower Show,4,,Visited Gardens by bay on an evening just in time for the music show which lasted for 14 minutes from 7.45 pm. The show was a teeny bit long and 10 minutes would be just right but that's my opinion. The actual lights show to music was unique and spectacular experience. Worth watching.,,
,,I feel like a tourist on holiday,5,,"Gardens By The Bay is a must visit for all tourists. It鈥檚 my first time there today. As a Singaporean, I seldom visit touristy places, especially one that needs tickets. But I felt proud to be a Singaporean when I was there. It was beautiful & grand. I almost bought an annual family pass. Perhaps, next time. You need at least a day there. I reached at 11am & left about 5pm. Should have re-entered the flower dome to see the night view. Bring a picnic mat and rest at the Supertree Grove Park. I felt like a tourist on holiday today. No stress when you are surrounded by the greens and beautiful flowers. Suggest to buy tickets for flower dome & cloud forest. Skywalk is an experience. Only these 3 places require tickets. Others are free. I don鈥檛 have time to go to the children鈥檚 water park or walk round the whole place. Bring a bottle as there鈥檚 drinking water tap for you to top up water. Singapore is sunny although flower dome & cloud forest is cooling. Wear a good pair of shoes as walking is required. We will definitely revisit this place.",,
,,WOW,5,,"We visited gardens by the bay twice during our time in Singapore, and were blown away both times. We visited at night, and were in awe of the phenomenal 'Supertrees' lit up. We also visited during the day, and went for a walk along the OCDC skyway (a must do), ate in a stunning restaurant serving local food and went to explore the gardens, one of the highlights being us running into an otter. Could have spent a whole day there, on eof the most amazing places in Singapore.",,
,,A must visit,5,,It was truly a wonderful experience. It's fantastic that so much is done for conservation etc. This in a country where basically everything is covered in plastic - Bags/Straws/cups etc.,,
,,Great Experience,5,,Buying ticket online is very easy and convenient plus free parking for several hours. Walking in the Cloud Forest is an amazing experience to see plants in different heights without really climb up mountains. The Flower Dome is lovely too.,,
,,Beautiful,4,,"Beautiful gardens with some stunning spaces, themes, artworks all combined in a mildly surreal space!!",,
,,what a place,5,,"gardens by the bay....sensational
the cloud forest takes you back in time and makes you think you're prehistoric man!!
breathtaking waterfall is the central theme and everything that grows around it, complements the sensations.
the flower dome is a walk through all the gardens of the world... very pretty on the eye. however there are no insects or natural pollenisation and no scent from the flowers. However the gardens are in pristine condition.
Overall a ""must see""",,
,,A must see in Singapore,5,,"A personal highlight of Singapore. Gardens by the Bay is truly a wonderful area to relax both during the day and in the evening. The Supertree Grove is the centre-point of the scenic area with large steel framed 鈥渢rees鈥?covered in foliage. The iconic images of Singapore!
The OCBC Skyway is a great place to take photographs and observe the city skyline from the canopy of the Supertrees.
In the evenings at 19:45 and 20:45, there is a music and light show - a must see at least once during your stay in the Lion City. The Cloud Forest and Flower Dome are within the complex and are not to be missed.
Access to Gardens by the Bay is free of charge, however there is a charge for the OCBC Skyway, the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome.",,
,,. Beautiful.,5,,Can spend hours here & highly recommend visiting the Cloud Forest as it is amazing. Loved our time spent here.,,
,,The most beautiful garden in the world!,5,,"I specifically wanted to see the Cloud Forest and I was not disappointed. The layout was perfect and the colours and varieties were way more than I expected. The combination of bromiliads and ferns was so beautifully done. I would visit there every day if I lived in Singapore. You must see all the Gardens by the Bay but above all, go inside the enchanted Cloud Forest and be lifted into another world.",,
,,Absolutely stunning,4,,"What an amazing area in Singapore - I only saw this in the day (very hot) I would recommend going very early in the morning, but I also think it would be lovely in the evening with all the lights.",,
,,"Awesome, the kids had fun",5,,"If you visit with kids and want to kill two birds with one stone then this is an awesome spot. Get the bathers, there is a children鈥檚 garden with water playground, sand playground, rope climbing cubby house and lots of flowers If you don鈥檛 want to have a splash you don鈥檛 have to, just head for a walk . We went there in the afternoon, 4pm, had fun and after couple of hours got changed and we went to Satey by the bay to grab some food. Then we headed back to the gardens for the light show at 7.45pm. The kids said it was awesome and it鈥檚 free too.If you want to go on the skywalk it was $8 per adult. One of the most memorable days of our trip . We saw this giant lizard too",,
,,Amazing!,5,,Beautiful show from the lights for gardens at the bay would advise anyone to go! Great for families and couples.,,
,,GARDENS BY THE BAY,5,,The flower garden was very beautiful and cooling.There was also a cloud forest and it was very cooling and so relaxing.My family enjoyed the experience.,,
,,Amazing free entertainment,5,,Loved loved loved the night light and sound show. This is a must do in Singapore. Every day of the year the show is run at 8pm and 9pm and is free. We got a spot about 30mins before the start and took great photos. Would go back for sure.,,
,,Wonderful experience,5,,The flower garden and Cloud forest were very educational and relaxing. My family enjoyed the experience.,,
,,A must see by night,5,,If you are in Singapore visit this wonderful Garden by afternoon to night to see the light show in the evening.The vertical garden trees are simply beautiful lit up with the symphony music played.Truly magnificent garden.,,
,,Night tim visit.,4,,"We went there with our little kids at around 1930, kids are 5 and 3 years old.

We where there just in time for the 20:00 Waltz light show. - Amazing

the gardens and the ""trees"" themselves where really nice, amazing to see it in real, so tall, colourful..

Everything is super clean, well behaved masses of people.

The taxis to get you back to the city where plenty full, after the lightship we went for a stroll because we thought most people would get taxis ASAP after the show..

and it was like that.. we got there around 2130 and the taxi rank was almost empty.

Great evening, beautiful surroundings ..

If i ever go back to Singapore i will definitely go back.

Enjoy",,
,,Impressive - but expensive!,5,,"One of Singapore鈥檚 most popular tourist attractions are the Gardens by the Bay - absolutely understandable!

The two domes 鈥淔lower Dome鈥?and 鈥淐loud Forest鈥?are beautiful and we鈥檝e spend a great time in both of them. The Cloud Forest is definitely the more impressive and socially important, delivering the message of how we need to protect the world we live in.

One negative aspect is the price. While there鈥檚 a deal for Singapore residents to by a ticket for only one of the domes, tourists have to by a ticket for both of them for $28. I wouldn鈥檛 call that cheap and I would have loved to have the option to just by a ticket for one dome.",,
,,Great light show!,5,,"We dropped by the gardens and settled down for a light show in the Gardens. This is certainly not your standard 'Blackpool Illuminations' at all. Lovely show for all the family to enjoy. Just turn up, lay down and get your camera ready!

Not to be missed! A live Avatar movie for sure!",,
,,Amazing Light Show at Night,5,,We took a taxi at night from our hotel in the city to Gardens By the Bay it cost $30 return to see the night Light Show...we got there about 6pm to get a spot and weren't disappointed it was amazing we sat up on a hill instead of being under it...It is absolutely worth it just amazing gardens & figure sculptures with light show to music,,
,,A must visit place,5,,Awesome experience. We all loved it. Please wear your walking shoes. Lots of walking all over. Limited options for dining. Somehow I found it confusing to find my way to the restaurant site. May be it's just me.,,
,,Fan of AVATAR MOVIE ..this is the place not to be missed :),5,,"Breath taking place so much varieties of flower with an amusing views inside GARDENS BY THE BAY , don't missed out their amazing light show at night, they have this man made steel trees at the center shines with beautiful different colors will make you feel child within. Feeling happy !!!",,
,,Most enormous and beautiful garden,5,,"Garden with a diversity of flowering and non flowering plants, trees. The best garden in all of Asia.",,
,,Don鈥檛 miss this.,5,,"We were
Literally blown away. It鈥檚 just amazing. We were able to just fluke it also with our times. Spent all afternoon there. Breathtaking. Managed to get upstairs for sunset and some of the best selfies you will ever take. Then went down stairs for 8pm light show. Truly breathtaking. I couldn鈥檛 recommend this place higher",,
,,Beautiful Night show with lights and lovely music,5,,"Lovely botanic gardens, definitely worth the time spent there, also great idea for childrens park with water feature.",,
,,Don鈥檛 miss this visit!,5,,We hopped off the open top bus and were there within a few minutes walk. Well worth the view from the walkway. We took lots of pictures and hope to return one day to see how the beautiful plants have grown.,,
,,Night light show,5,,Stunning light display with huge super trees lighting up in time to music. Easy rail links and entry is free.,,
,,Great Place of Refreshing,4,,Nice place to spend your time in between international flights. Easy to reach with MRT or taxi. If you like gardens and walking this is the place to be.,,
,,Incredible,5,,"I went with no expectations and it was the most amazing experience, the contrast of the urban background and the green of the park is amazing, if you鈥檙e visiting the gardens you definitely should go to Cloud Forest.",,
,,Incredible viewing at night,5,,What a cracking place this is. It looks amazing in the dark as it sits on the bottom of marina Bay Sands. Must visit if in Singapore and it鈥檚 free. Great pictures to add to the memories,,
,,Beautiful and amazing!,5,,"We were in Singapore for 4 days and spent almost a day in this park. There was so much to see: the two domes (flowers and cloud forest), the supertrees, and the skyway among the supertrees - these are the must see ones! Inside the flower dome, there so many types of flowers and plants from different regions in the world, including a huge variety of orchids, Singapore's national flower. The cloud forest dome did not disappoint either. There's a waterfall and a spiral walkway filled with tropical plants artistically displayed in every turn. The architecture of the domes in itself is to be admired.
The supertrees are located in three different areas of the park, and they are beautiful, especially seen at night when they are lit! There's a light and music show twice, every night. It's free to watch the supertrees and walk around the park - entrance fee is required for the two domes (flower and cloud forest - well worth!) and the skyway high above with the supertrees. Be aware that there's a limit of 15 minutes in the skyway when there are a lot of people.
Recommended: stay at the Marina Bay Sands hotel which has a bridge connecting the hotel to the park so it's easily accessible day and night. You can also see the gardens from high above if you stay at the hotel in a room facing the garden, or by going to the hotel's Skypark Observation Deck on the 57th floor, which is open to the public.
If visiting Singapore, Gardens by the Bay is a must see!!!",,
,,Wow!,5,,"Really enjoyed my time here. Arrived around 6pm and stayed through the music & light show in the Supertree Grove. I only visited the Cloud Forest (see pictures) and, based on recommendations from friends who live in SG, it was more than enough for me. Very cool exhibit - literally - which is a welcome respite from the heat in SG!

It's a great balance of outdoor and indoor activity - fantastic resource in Singapore. Location is good although not central - just a quick walk from the Marina Bay Sands and the Bayfront MRT (which is how I arrived).

The light show which starts after sundown (8pm-ish) is a MUST SEE. Really well done and lasts for almost 30 minutes.

Only issue I had is that they try to upsell you on admission: you're led to believe that as a non-Singaporean you have to buy a ticket for 2 conservatories (Flower Dome or Cloud Forest) for S$28. In reality, you can buy a ticket for just one conservatory which will set you back only S$16...which is what I did. Furthermore, they charge S$8 to go up on the Skyway but at dusk the wait was more than 90 minutes even if you had a ticket...glad I didn't go for that!",,
,,Must do when in singapore 馃嚫馃嚞!,5,,"The Marina Bay Gardens are superb. Free access to many different gardens with plenty of trails. Cool in the Singaporean heat and humidity.
Pay for access to Cloud Forest 鈽旓笍 - this was magical and dreamlike.
Light show at dusk/ nightfall was really special. Had dinner in the food hall there that has plenty of good restaurants. We had delicious Indian while watching the light show.",,
,,Amazing,5,,"You really need to allow a full day for this, and into the evening if you are going to do the night show. It is a lovely gentle walk, suitable for wheelchairs and prams. Plenty of food outlets and restaurants and several souvenir shops. , plus the two domes. Definitely worth a visit. Close to MTR and hop on hop off buses.",,
,,Strongly recommended,5,,Incredible beauty of plants. Gentle flower scent. All is perfectly organized. Very comfortable inside the conservatoires in spite of heat outdoors.,,
,,Lovely,5,,"A relaxing and very educational stroll. Lots of shade to escape the sun and lots of beautiful and peaceful views. Food options are limited, which is a pity because one can easily spend several hours in this place.",,
,,Excellent,5,,A great place to walk around. We went on the skyway to fully appreciate super tree grove and take some excellent photos of the gardens.,,
,,Spectacular real & artificial plants,5,,"Really amazing from the architectural point of view, enchanting if we just stop for a while and consider how many microclimates have created there. Suggest to entry there just 1 hour before sunset in order to be present at the lighting...it sounds really magic!",,
,,must do place,5,,we visited the gardens along with rain forest. i would strongly suggest to go day time to get good clicks and then later on you can visit for an evening stroll to capture some good clicks with the lighting,,
,,Beautiful especially at night,5,,"My mom and I spent a day at the Gardens by the Bay. And it was a day well spent and we loved every bit of it! This is a must place to visit when travelling to Singapore. We were fascinated seeing super-trees. In the morning you can dwell in it鈥檚 beauty with the rays of sun illuminating the trees. At night, you鈥檒l have fun watching the supertrees lights鈥?while dancing with the music. Highly recommend a visit to anyone interested in visiting Singapore in the future!",,
,,Exceptional view...,5,,Such of wonderful place to visit..we love the every single detail in this place.everything made to meet your desire..,,
,,Really beautiful,5,,"We thoroughly enjoyed this beautiful garden. It leaves you in awe just the fact that this is a man-made structure that looks absolutely beautiful. For the amount of people visiting, the place is very clean, including the bathrooms. Definitely worth a visit if you're in Sinagore.",,
,,Bay of gardens. Singapore,5,,Worth a walk around both domes Especially in the heat of the day. Nice temp inside Beautiful flowers that will require 2 hours per dome to have a good look recommend this cool place,,
,,Beauty and some beasties.,4,,"A place that definitely has that ""wow"" factor even if, like us, you're not especially a flowery type person. There are countless photo opportunities so make sure the camera is fully charged.",,
,,Garden on Singapore,4,,"Beautiful garden very well cared for and characteristic.
The route to visit them is not clear and if you do not pay attention you risk to pass several times to the same point.
There are many attractions and in the evening you can enjoy, for free, a musical show with beautiful play of lights.",,
,,beautiful!,5,,"Very beautiful and awe-inspiring! we loved this place, especially the night rhapsody light show. flowers were lovely! ocbc skyway was breathtaking and thrilling at the same time :-) just bring umbrella, shades, or cap, to cover yourself up as the sun can be scorching. wait for the mist at the cloud forest! it can be tiresome to go up but worth it! there was no queue at the ocbc skyway when we got there so it was very good!",,
,,Amazing night,5,,We went to the gardens on the bay at night it was a amazing experience and we wanted to see the light show but the lady at the counter she said it's not worth it so we watched it out the windows of the gardens and it's definitely not worth the money! So glad we went highly recommend it.,,
,,the flowerdome is fantastic.,5,,Strongly recommend the 2 flower domes . Gardens by the Bay is a dreamland and many food/restaurants to choose from. The staff are so helpful and friendly.,,
,,A must visit for flower and nature lovers,5,,Amazed to see to daffoddil which is been planted in a covered arena of tropical climate. It is a must visit for all flower lovers. I never ever have seen so many flowers and tropical plants at one place.,,
,,Beautiful garden,5,,"The garden was so beautiful, many flowers blooming when we visited, the orchids so lovely, the air also very good, my son like to visit here. Very recommended to see when you visit Singapore",,
,,Definitely visit but check maintenance dated,5,,Various parts of the Gardens are closed for maintenance one day a month. Check the website. You don't want to miss the skywalk. The Gardens themselves are free but the conservatories have an entry fee. There is a restaurant and bar at the top of the tallest supertree. The view from the bar at sunset is worth seeing but you can't see the light show from up there and you don't want to miss that. Do make sure you're back on the ground at show time.,,
,,Magnificent,5,,"Excellent place to visit for everyone, be it kids, youths or senior citizen. Cooled conservatories - Cloud forest and Flower dome is awesome. And Supertrees view is a treat to watch. Night view of Supertrees are awesome.",,
,,Nature + technology?,5,,"The Gardens are big for such a central location. It is usually too hot to walk around to see plants from different countries. An audio tour will take you around in sheltered comfort. It cost $5 when I visited.
The major attractions are the two domes - Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. Flower Done was building of the year in 2012. The wide roof does not require the support of pillars to provide a broad view of the whole place. Plants from all over the world are carefully displayed. It is more a museum of living plants than a garden. Good to check for special exhibition at Flower Dome if you have flexibility on which time of the year to visit. Thousands of tulips during Tulipmania around April/May never disappointed me.

Cloud Forest is tall instead of wide. Taking the lift up and slowly walking down gives a very pleasant experience.

Both domes are cold. An exhibition at the bottom of the Cloud Forest shows how they are powered. Educational. But a cardigan might be useful for those sensitive to lower temperatures.

The sky walk near the super tree structures cost extra. I have not climbed it myself but friends said it is a better experience (and much cheaper) that the Singapore Flyer (ferris wheel).

A visit can take all day. It is also worthwhile to come in the evening to watch the free light shows and stroll around.",,
,,Well worth attending,5,,The gardens are beautiful and breath taking and well worth the visit. A must see for anyone going to Singapore,,
,,Great place to visit.,5,,Take 2 or 3 hours to walk around. Do not miss the cloud forest. It is a must to see. A lot of pics to take and a lot of thing to learn.,,
,,Amazing place!!!,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is an amazing attraction, especially the 2 observatories - Flower Garden and Cloud Forest, with Cloud Forest the most attractive one. The man-made water fall and the misty forest is super cool! The music and light show in the evening in the SuperGrove tree section is also fantastic.
Any visit to Singapore is incomplete without a visit to Gardens by the Bay. Highly recommended for families.",,
,,A bit disappointing,3,,"Very crowded especially we aimed to see the lighting for the kids. It's slightly inconvenience to us with strollers yet inconsiderate visitors all rushed in to the lifts. And there's only 2 lifts, perhaps a signage or a note to the visitors to use stairs and escalator and giving the space to the one with wheels. Nothing special about the lighting, yet its packed with tourist and locals.",,
,,thoroughly enjoyed,5,,Nice tourist attraction for the family. Need almost the whole day there. Best part id the night light show with the music. Gets really packed out.,,
,,Amazing place,5,,Great place. Must visit . Amazing decorations and plants. Flower domes super trees. Musical and lights at the super tree at 745 and 845pm daily .,,

,,Great garden by the bay,4,,Great view of the marina. Very pretty at night. Day and night views are very different. Be sure to go day and night.,,
,,August visit,5,,Lovely gardens to wander around with plenty of attractions to see and well laid out and planned. Just take plenty of fluids as the heat can be oppressive.,,
,,Gardens by the bay,5,,Great piece of art. The building itself so beautiful and no words to express what is inside. Great flower show with very rare plants. Climate controlled based on the requirement od the plant and we can jusr say woW!,,
,,Spectacular visual sensory,5,,"Aside from its unique and eco-friendly structure, this place is packed with seasonal thematic display. You will be in awe both in the day and night, although I would recommend you spend your time casually to cover both. Definitely a gem not to be missed in your visit to Singapore.",,
,,"Yes, it is free",5,,"When you are visiting Singapore you never miss this park. This engineering beauty mix a park, technology and wildlife. Everything mixed with excellent taste, also you will have a great place to dine and a enjoyable place.
And it is free, well I think this is one of best spots in this great city",,
,,Amazing evening light show.,5,,These gardens are beautiful by day but the free evening light show is fantastic. The shows vary and the artificial trees and walkway are lit by multicoloured lights synchronised to music. Stunning!!,,
,,A must for visitors to Singapore,5,,"The musical and lights show at the s
Supertree is a must to see during the evening when the sun sets. 2 shows nightly.

There are also the 2 domes; flowers and rainforests. Feel the temperate cool air inside the dome.

Truly represents Singapore Garden City.",,
,,Lovely and Awesome!,5,,"It has been quite a while since my last visit here and so in conjunction with the ""Singapore Garden Festival 2018"", my family and I decided to revisit this place again.

For gardening enthusiasts and flower lovers, you will surely fall in love with this place as it is very beautifully decorated with lovely and colourful flowers all over, in particular, Orchids! They are lovely and well maintained and sure will help you to indulge in the green and yet cooling environment! Despite of the warm and sunny weather outside, it was so cooling and refreshing here!

The cloud forest, in particular, is a must visit. Though man made, the nice interior water falls created a buzz for many visitors, very nice and spectacular, especially when visitors walk down from the top (7th storey), along the winding metal walkway, you can see the lovely surrounding, nice flowers and greenery.

When we finished visiting the 2 domes, it was way past 7pm and all the lightings had been switched on and it was also very nice and beautiful at night, if not, nicer!

We bought our tickets at a roadshow well in advance and so we didn't need to queue to get the tickets. We visited on a weekday afternoon and thus much less crowded than the weekends, which accordingly to our friends, would take hours to queue to enter the 2 domes for visitation.

So this place is one of the most iconic landmarks and highly recommended for a visit, for both foreign visitors and locals!",,
,,Breathe taking,5,,Beautiful place to visit especially at the golden hour views were amazing loved it and would recommend having a drink up on the observation tower beautiful and great photos,,
,,Cloud forest and flower dome,5,,"My mom is a fan of nature and beauty and she absolutely loved it.
just for the flower dome and the cloud forest you need a total of about three hours. These are huge conservatories with a mass display of a variety of flowers and plants.
The cloud dome is like a huge mountain with an artificial waterfall as well.
Must visit in singapore.",,
,,Beautiful place,5,,Beautiful place. Would highly recommend visiting at night to see the light show and paying to see the cloud forest.,,

,,A must Do,5,,"This is a must do for anyone visiting Singapore, The presentation of these gardens is something special. Make sure you return at night for the light show, its spectacular.",,
,,Huge and Beautiful,5,,"Was here with my sister. Had some hard time reaching there from Merlion. Walked for quite a distance and pass through Marina Bay Sands to reach here.

Paid 3SGD/pax to take the shuttle from the entrance to the Dome. Found out that there is another entrance ticket needed to be purchase to access both the flower dome.

Food here was sold at reasonable price.",,
,,Amazing Place....,5,,"A great way to spend with family and love ones.Beautiful variety of flowers and you will really love them. Different sizes of pumpkins and oh i love their colors. From this place i imagined how beautiful nature is. I love the man made water falls, it was really amazing and beautifully done. From their you can feel how gifted we are with nature and how talented and creative man is.....Mom got scared walking on a cloud walk bridge but enjoyed it...I can say thank you for this place.",,

,,Best attraction in Singapore!,5,,"Gardens by the Bay are a Fantastic new attraction, not to be missed, every city should have one!! Hard to pick the best part but the evening Laser light show is incredible",,
,,Too busy,3,,"Would have been a great visit if it wasn鈥檛 so busy, queues to get in the conservatories and the skywalk of over 1 hour. Once inside it is a beautiful place to visit. Didn鈥檛 get to the top of the skywalk as the queue was too long.",,
,,Love the gardens but that light show is overrated.,4,,"Ive visited this garden several times and usually buy my tickets on other websites as they do offer better discounts. It is usually not too crowded and you can take your time taking in the scents and colours of all the different flora. As for the light show, it starts off nice but after a while it just gets redundant. Really don't understand all the hype.",,
,,Definitely worth a visit,4,,"Definitely worth a visit for those who love plants. The incredible indoor climate controlled gardens house plant species from all over the world. However, it will be a disappointment for those who want to see just flowers.",,
,,Amazing dome with beautiful flowers,3,,"Beautiful flowers and cooling dome, suitable for all ages (young and old). See the variety of flowers from different nation.",,
,,Must visit place in Singapore.,5,,"Visited garden by the bay in August 2018.you can reach by MRT.Getdown at Bay front station on circle line(yellow line). follow the direction of board to garden.There are battery operated vehicles which take you to domes.

,,Beautiful place to spend half a day at...,5,,A great way to spend half a day in a a beautiful sculptured garden and viewing the wide variety of flora. Great for kids to explore too with the tall tree structures...,,
,,The Garden City,5,,"Have visited on many occasions with guests and family. You really won鈥檛 believe it till you see it, from the waterfalls to the steel trees and the plant life in the two domes. Make sure you take a good camera. Whether walking around outside or inside many great adventures await.",,
,,amazing place and beautifully done,5,,"so much work has gone into these gardens really enjoyed these but it was crowded, the sculptures were amazing",,
,,Awesome,5,,Gardens by the Bay is a place to be visited by everyone wether they like Gardens and flowers. Once you go there youll start liking Gardens and Flowers. Its beautiful and the best part is its Fully Air Conditioned so you can visit it any given point of time .,,
,,Excellent place for one and all,5,,"One can spend about half a day minimum. It would be good if you start your day a little late so that you can continue to watch lighting in the evening.Ideal way is, reach gardens by bay around 3 pm watch the place till 6pm and continue the light and music show. Although it is a little humid now in August, its ok. You can take pictures which will create a sweet memory.
If youre early to gardens by bay, you can cover marina bay sands.
Caution: if you have luggage and kids, you may have to walk a lot.",,
,,Amazing Gardens,5,,"If there is only one thing you do in Singapore, make it the Gardens by the Bay. The domes are a must see as is the light show in the evenings at the Super Tree Grove. Even though I have lived here for three years I still do not get tired of these gardens.",,
,,Must visit in Singapore,5,,"If you visit Singapore, make sure to visit Garden by the bay. Do not miss the light show in super tree grove. The best place to watch the light show is lie on your back under the super trees",,
,,Manmade forest idea for weekend walks,5,,"It is man made urban oasis built by our government with various types of plants from all over the world are planted inside the two buildings. Actually i enjoy the free experience walking around the park , sometimes u might see otters resting at the river side. A must go place for all visitors to Singapore besides Marina Bay Sands, recommended after 3pm - 7pm whereby the sun is not too hot.",,
,,Beautiful at night.,4,,"The light show is unique and worth seeing. The rooftop bar is very good, with nice views over Singapore. The only down side is that after the light show, the park emptied very quickly and we were hoping to get food. The only place we found. (Satay restaurant) was not great. Many parts were closed and the staff were not very helpful. The food was reasonable though.",,
,,Description of gardens by bay,5,,"First of all, it is must visit.It is open space except for the two observatories which are cooled.Flower dome is OK to visit. It will take 30 min to completeCloud forest is MUST visit. It will take 1 hour + to complete.MRT station is basement 2 of hotel marina bay sands.Walk of approx 10 min to garden.Head straight to cooled observatories..Best time --- reach there at 4 pm---complete it by 6 pm...then u can loiter around in garden till 7 pm...After that a sound show is there at super tree grove.After that u can head back to Marina bay sands and njy casino.",,
,,Amazing light show with music,5,,This is a must see while in Singapore. The night light show to music is amazing. Try to arrive early as there are no spare spaces to sit come show time. Bring along something to sit on ie. rug so you can sit and enjoy the show.,,
,,Amazing View from the tree tops,5,,"Holy light up trees! This is a must to do when in Singapore. We purchased the three in one ticket and it did not disappoint. Make sure you leave plenty of time to explore the flower garden, the Cloud forest and it is a must to go on the tree top sky walk at dark. The light show is amazing from that level. Make sure you get there in line before the sun sets. Then after the light show head on up to the roof top bar and hang up there for a bit. It is worth the price.",,
,,Pleasure trip,5,,"I highly recommend going through the gardens.They are amazing.But allow a full day to enjoy them.So much to see and to do.Didnt get to the restaurant at the top,but have been told the views are amazing.",,
,,A must do,5,,"An interesting walk with lots to see. Lots of toilets, places to eat etc on site and reasonably priced.

Lots of hidden gems and places to sit and relax whilst taking it all in. And in true Singapore style, it was immaculate and very well kept.",,
,,LOVE THIS PLACE!!! 鉂わ笍馃嚫馃嚞,5,,"We absolutely love Gardens by the Bay, it鈥檚 futuristic looks simply amazing at night and you can easily loose hours here!! The Domes are great especially the Cloud Dome which has an amazing waterfall pick the right day and time and it can be quiet. The flower dome has some great sculptures dotted around so keep your eyes peeled for them. Spend time walking around the park as there are some good sights to see. You will find yourself heading for the shops for a bit of AC as respite from the heat!!
Do the Supertree grove aerial walkway which is cheap at $8 and the light show at 7.45pm its mint!!! All in all a great place to go and my fave place in Singers 鉂わ笍",,
,,Awesome place,5,,"Grate place to spend morning , walked from Clarke quye around Bay , then underpass below the hotel to the gardens , with byeing tickets to go into the glass houses . It's free to walk around park , take buggy with you for children as very hot and a bit hilly. Food shopping on site for lunch. At night has light show but didn't go back as rained.",,
,,Stroll amongst the clouds,5,,Cloud forest never fails to take your breath away when you see it for the first time...The powerful crash of water from many stories above create the rumbling sound before just outside the entrance before you see the majestic fall. take the lift to the very top and walk down a curvilinear path that winds itself around the giant glass clam that is the dome. mist from the giant structure creates a magical space that accentuates the colours of the flowers among the white of the mist...definitely a great place to while away a hot afternoon...,,
,,Cool!,4,,"There are two parts to the Gardens - the free exterior gardens, and the paid domed gardens - Cloud Forest, and Flower Dome. When you're done saving money in the free exterior gardens, enjoyed the majesty of the SuperTrees, and been appropriately impressed (or horrified) by the gigantic albino floating baby (Google ""gigantic albino floating baby gardens by the bay""), traipsed through the various heritage garden and you are now sweating bullets (because you visited the Gardens in the heat of the day!), you can finally agree to get a ticket to the climate controlled (yes, air-conditioning) domes. Cloud forest seems a little cooler to me, but a little damp. Flower Dome seems more... civilised.

A good way to plan your visit is to come in the late afternoon - about 4 pm or after. Sunset in Singapore is about 7 pm (we are on permanent Daylight Saving Time).

It would be cooler than midday-early afternoon. But still hot (30 C) and humid. Enjoy the climate controlled paid domes, then venture out of the cool zone around sunset.

The light show begins at 7:45 pm, so you might have time to grab dinner. But the restaurants would probably be crowded. So a viable alternative is to have a sunset picnic on the grounds, while you wait for the light show to begin at the SuperTree grove.",,
,,Catch it during Garden Festival 2018,5,,"Was there again during the Garden Festival, and it was just amazing to see how artists from around the world would gather and do huge floral arrangements, and the inclusion of the Marketplace where vendors from around the world also gather to hawk their wares. Good time to see plants from other parts of the world and better prices than we would normally.
The visit can never be complete with a walk in the two domes! Again, for plant lovers, it's just amazing to see the collection of plants, especially those not found in our tropical climates.",,
,,Fun in the Gardens with Family and Friends,5,,Got a chance to go back to the Gardens and loved them so much we purchased annual passes. The Gardens never disappoint with new programs and seasonal changes! The staff is able to keep the colours vibrant and provide a sense of their natural habitats. We really enjoy the special programs and are looking for to the Mid-Autumn displays. What a treat for our family and friends that visit from overseas!,,
,,One of the top attractions in Singapore,4,,You鈥檒l get to see the different types of plants and flowers and the theme changes regularly so it is never boring. It is especially beautiful at night and around Christmas time there鈥檚 even a Christmas fair and beautiful Christmas decorations that attract many avid photographers.,,
,,Cool and Relaxful,4,,"I got my tics online from Lazada
It was. Good values much cheaper compared to buying direct.
My son and I just got n茅w cameras so. Was eager to test out. A cool Environmental to enjoy the greens in the heart of a city. The grounds around the flower dome also has concerts and festivites mostly free.",,
,,Sight-seeing,5,,"it is a very modern building with varies zone of flowers from different countries. the signature is the orchid, which is the national flower of singapore",,
,,Cool forest,5,,"It is a very cool place to visit . All the fauna and flora , with cascading waterfall and easy to walk path and a wonderful overview of the whole place. Love it very much.",,
,,Breathtakingly beautiful,5,,"From the moment we walked in we were in ore of our surroundings. The scale, colours, cleanliness are perfect. As humans we felt very insignificant standing under the super trees. Their construction is magnificent joined with the amazement of Mother Nature at her best. The tree top walk is well worth it with amazing views of the city and surrounds. The light show is a must as well. Sitting on the ground listening to the music around you, watching the trees light up it鈥檚 like they come to life.",,
,,Out of this world,5,,This Place would have to be one of the main highlights of our Singapore visit and you can spend a whole day there and evening to watch the solar powered super trees show magnificent. August 2017,,
,,Amazing place,5,,"A must visit place in singapore,best time to visit here is during evening time, find it out yourself.....",,
,,unusual,4,,"It's an interesting mix of the natural and artificial. The super trees, for example, are man-made but they are works of art. Go in the evenings to enjoy the light show (not sure of the times though). I liked both conservatories, especially the Cloud Forest. The Skyway isn't worth it, IMO.",,
,,Satay by the bay,5,,Satay Bt The Bay is located wirhin easy walking distance of the 2 domes. Great Singapore fod at great prices After your meal you can stroll around the vast grounds,,
,,Gardens by the Bay Singapore,5,,It is impressive! The flower dome is air conditioned at the right temperature for the plants to survive. The wide display of plants was astounding! I love the many varieties of herbs. You get to see families of herbs outside its famous restaurant. I just felt great and heavenly walking in the world's biggest greenhouse!,,
,,Must visit place,5,,GBTB provides a natural sanctuary for exotic flowers and plants. Cloud forest is a great place for feeling as if we are at 6000 feet. My kids were amazed to see insect eating animals,,
,,Garden by the bay,5,,Good scenary with night display. Spending a good time in the garden with family. You can see beautiful flowers. Convenient too.,,
,,Beautiful Garden by the bay,5,,"If your are in Singapore, please make some time and visit Garden by the bay. Go around the garden which itself is beautiful. Go on top of the sky walk around the super trees. Visit the flower dome and cloud dome to experience the beauty of different flowers and plants along with a rain forest in cloud dome.They also have a light and sound show around the Super trees.
If you have Singapore Air boarding pass you will get some discount as well for tickets to flower&cloud dome.",,
,,Gardens to Explore when in Singapore,5,,Gardens by the Bay is an excellent example of the beauty of nature amidst the City and Singapore is aptly named a city in the garden. It should be on your list when visiting Singapore. Easily accessible by the MRT and buses. Beautiful in every sense of the world. Eateries and souvenir shop around. Many water dispensing points to quench your thirst and many scenic spots to capture the photographs to remember.,,
,,Must do!,5,,Amazing experience by day and by night. Flower domes are a must. Easiest to take a taxi to and from if you don鈥檛 want to walk a lot.,,
,,Outstanding Gardens,5,,Gardens by the Bay is one of my favourite places in Singapore. The Flower Dome and the Cloud Dome is a must as they are both so unique in their own way. The surrounding gardens are also really beautiful and lush and the kids area is really good too.,,
,,It鈥檚 unique and mesmerising,5,,Lost of words ... one small country gives you the glimpse of the flora and fauna if the universe ... trees and plants you. May have never seen and at the end .. they leave a message on conservation of water - recycling of rain water .. and lastly save trees and save the planet ... its spectacular...,,
,,good,5,,"good place to go and unwind. just that i cannot stand huge group of uncultured tourist. overall, staff friendly.",,
,,Breathtakingly Beautiful,5,,What a beautiful place to visit. Gardens by the Bay is possibly the most wonderful man made features I鈥檝e come across in many years. The evening light show in the Supertree Grove is not to be missed. I can鈥檛 wait to go back one day!,,
,,An oasis in a busy city,5,,A must if you visit Singapore. Amazing flowering structures. Fabulous night lights. I was in awe of this place. It was a feast for the eyes. I didn鈥檛 know where to look first.,,
,,Another great area for walking and enjoying the city.,5,,The Gardens by the Bay are a very large area that is built on reclaimed land by the bay. You will enjoy the Futuristic trees in the area as well as the Cloud Forest. It again could be an all day excursion and is totally enjoyable.,,
,,Absolutely beautiful!,5,,This was one of the coolest places I鈥檝e been to. The indoor botanical garden was my favorite! The waterfall is so awesome! Very reasonably priced and can take your time everywhere! Fantastic photo opportunities!!,,
,,Hordes of people,3,,"I went on a Monday, thinking that there would be less people around. However, when I arrived, it felt very much like a weekend with simply hordes of tourists and visitors. Then I found out when I was buying my ticket that the Cloud Forest Dome was closed for maintenance. So I was left with only the other option, the Flower Dome.
This proved a mistake as there was, firstly, inane muzak piping on a loop non-stop which was extremely irritating. Secondly, there were way too many people-again, concentrated in a single, closed setting.
All in all, the visit was spoilt for me, despite the interesting plants and flowers in an air-conditioned setting.
Then, it was off to the overhead walkway and after shelling out S$8, went up with a whole elevator load of people with their babies and children and pushcarts.
If you think you will find peace and quiet here, this is definitely NOT the place for it.
There was also surprisingly very little varied bird life in the outside areas. I saw the ubiquitous mynahs, pigeons, crows and doves. With a Sunda Pygmy Woodpecker-which made my day; and water monitor lizard thrown in for good measure.
I would suggest the Management provides means for public feedback to make much needed improvements.
An experience not to be repeated.",,
,,Garden by the Bay,5,,This garden by the Bay is unique. It showcases the tropical plants found in South East Asia and display in a very natural surrounding with a tall man made waterfall. It is very refreshing just the sight of it. It is worth visiting. You will enjoy walking on a multi storey see through glass walkway which winds down from the TOP of the waterfall to the ground level.,,
,,Beautiful gardens in the city,4,,"Very close to the Marina sand hotel,beautiful gardens with many kind of flowers and a big waterfall.(big queue to get inside the forest cloud)",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"We bought the ticket at Changi Airport. When we arrived there we can walk in side directly with our check the ticket but when we go to the dome(2 dome) we have to show the ticket for go inside. It very beautiful with many plant and flower. We
Are so excited",,
,,Excellent Morning,5,,A visit to this attraction is a must if visiting Singapore. Entry price is reasonable as this is a government owned attraction.,,
,,Nice cooled Domes,5,,Nice place to go. 2 Domes but the Dome with the waterfall inside was super! Buy online tickets its a bit cheaper. Look for Voyagin website but you have to collect your tickets inside Marina Sands ground floor.,,
,,Garden by the bay,5,,Bring my family of 4 with 2 teens. Nice hot weather and the flower doom is rather cooling inside. Went there on Garden Festival. Lots to see and had taken almost 300+ photos especial the rare flowers. Recommend you to bring your family there worth going. Will go again,,
,,Beautiful,5,,"They have a wow-factor from the minute you walk out onto the bridge from Marina Bay Sands hotel. We were there on an extremely busy Sunday but managed to enjoy despite crowds. Cloud Forest was excellent. A lot of accessible information on forest ecology and sustainability that most of the crowd missed in their endeavour to get the perfect selfie. The planting and structure including waterfall was quite amazing.
The queue for the flower dome was extremely long as I think there was a promotion on for Singaporeans, so we wandered around the gardens and amidst the supertree sculptures instead.
Worth a return visit.",,
,,Must go,5,,"I'm a local who brings all my friends who come here to visit from overseas. It's a must place to go simply because of the architecture and variety of flora on display. There's a fee for visiting the domes, but you can also sit around the park benches and enjoy the scenery. The park is not sheltered except for the dome area, so try to avoid going in the midday when it can get really hot. Marina bay sands hotel is right opposite so there are plenty of picture-taking opportunities in this area.",,
,,An interesting day out and the evening light and music performance was beautiful,5,,I have been here several times and each time there is something different to see. Well worth a visit,,
,,A must for anyone visiting Singapore,4,,We visited the light show and the gardens and were thrilled by both. You just want to photograph everywhere. It is so pristine and colourful. The gardens domes and skywalk are amazing. Great.views of harbour front. Loved it.,,
,,Lovely experience,4,,It was a great experience! There were just too many people visiting so it's a little uncomfortable roaming around but the attractions are definitely worth visiting. My favorite is the Garden Rhapsody show at night.,,
,,"Gardens by the bay, Singapore 馃嚫馃嚞",5,,"The place is at its best at night. Tree lights and decors makes you feel happy and relaxed鉂わ笍馃挄 when you go through the park, don鈥檛 forget to bring tissue/towels with you and wear flats so it鈥檒l be more comfortable for you to walk around馃憣馃徎",,
,,"Beautiful, but overcrowded.",4,,"The gardens were beautiful, especially the ones in the Cloud and Flower domes. However, there are always, ALWAYS way too many tourists in ANY of the areas of interest (domes + main Super Tree grove). They're also quite far from the main points of entry. Prepare to walk or spend for rides in and out of the main area.",,
,,Man-made wonder,5,,"A must visit place on the Singapore itinerary!the glass enclosed domes have beautifully laid out gardens and flower shows .the flower shows keep on changing seasonally...all well labelled for people to know.
Even the children's festival held in the open areas is a big hit with well thought of activities for all age groups.",,
,,Two beautiful domes perfect for all wearher,5,,"The flower dome has some of the most beautiful flowers in the world. It鈥檚 divided by continents, vast n refreshing. And there鈥檚 an area for seasonal flowers too. The temperature makes it perfect when it鈥檚 hot weather. The cloud forest is gorgeous but compared to the last time I was there there seems to be lesser mountain flora n fauna and the tempereature has been readjusted to be slightly warmer. But the waterfall inside is pretty awesome. Worth visiting st least once. A wonder of Singapore.",,
,,Spectacular!,5,,"A must-see (by day and by night) for all trips to Singapore! It's free entry for the open garden and for the stunning light and sound night show, but also worth the cost of tickets to enter the two domes with mind-blowing arrangements inside!",,
,,Well Worth a Visit,5,,We spent about half a day here. Both the flower exhibit and cloud forest exhibits are wonderful. We did the OCBC Skyway at sunset to catch the light show. It was incredible and highly recommend doing this walk at this time. The light show lasts about 30 minutes and is on every night.,,
,,Awesome visit,5,,Loved this place! So beautiful and unreal. It鈥檚 a must see for anyone visiting Singapore! Don鈥檛 miss this,,
,,Well worth a visit,5,,"Take sunscreen and plenty of water!! It gets so hot out there!
The flower dome is an absolutely beautiful place to visit, best part? Its air conditioned!! So many beautiful flowers and tree to view. The cloud forest dome is beautiful as well, you cant go past the waterfall when you go in.
The giant trees in the gardens are a stunning view in themselves. Not worth the $8 to do the sky walk. Plenty of other places to get a good view.",,
,,Beautiful unforgotable Garden,5,,"U can spend full day in this beautiful garden. Cloud forest, Flower dome and OCBC skyway is having entrance tickets. Super tree grove is looking beautiful in night with different colors. Too worth to spend time. Waterfall from top of Cloud forest is amazing.",,
,,Everything is amazing just look at the detail and work to create this! WOW.,5,,Take your time plan the day and just enjoy the whole experience.The music combined with a great light show is a top finally to your day.,,

,,Amazing Place,5,,We went to Singapore second time at March 2018. We love to visited Gardens by the Bay. We think this place is amazing and can't believe it from human. We spent time in this place for several hour for enjoy with many kind of flower and garden.,,
,,A Must See in SG!,5,,"As always, SG impresses me with their new developments, unique projects and destinations! Gardens by the Bay is one of the unique places in SG, very educational for the kids and provides a nice walkable destination! Highly recommended in SG!",,
,,Holiday,5,,"I have been to Gardens by the Bay before but there is now so much more to see. The plants, trees and flowers are amazing and I strongly recommend a visit. There is also a sky walk which is well worth doing.",,
,,Garden of its kind,5,,Visiting gardens by the bay was a good idea just to chill and walk and feel the nature . I loved it and would recommend anyone to visit the garden as the entrance is free .,,
,,Gardens by the bay,5,,"This is place for people selfie or take photo with a lot kind of flowers. On the way to ""Gardens by the bay"", walking around 5mins use shortcut or take shuttle.",,
,,"Stunning, magnificent what more can I say!",5,,"This is one very busy place where movement through the huge domes is often very slow due to the tourist crowds. I went in the afternoon and was warned that the Cloud Dome conservatory is not airconditioned, I didn't find this a problem as the huge waterfall cascading down from a tropical plant and fern covered man-made tower seemed to cool the huge space. The Domes are both a feat in architecture and a marvel in tropical garden display as you wander behind waterfalls, wind your way up the man-made 'plant' tower and through lush tropical growth both beautiful in its greenery as in its coloured flowers and leaves. The Flower Dome is airconditioned, displays change regularly, the colours are stunning as the displays are choreographed to contrast, blend in colour, texture and form. There are areas which feature gardens form far off lands, the dry, drought gardens are in juxtaposition to the lush tropical gardens. Statues and garden art made from various materials feature throughout the gardens, some picking up the light or water droplets and throwing the light around grottos, others large, some subtle, others making a statement. This was the highlight of my trip. Highly recommended.",,
,,MUST VISIT - Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. Give OCBC Skyway a miss.,5,,"The Flower Dome is a must visit at Gardens By The Bay. It is a flower garden that contains different varieties of flowers and plants from all over the world. It is enclosed so you don't have to worry about rain and very well air-conditioned (mind you it is scorching hot outside!). Friendly for people in wheelchair & family with toddlers on strollers. One can easily spend an hour or two here.

The Cloud Forest is amazing. When you enter you will be greeted by a towering lush tropical forest and waterfall. It is also enclosed and very cool inside. One awesome thing is the Cloud Walk whereby it is located high up the Cloud Forest and you can walk up close and personal to the vegetation that clad's to the side of the mountain. An hour should be enough here.

If you have toddlers or kids, you may want to visit the Far East Organization Children's Garden. The highlight is obviously the water park and your kids will definitely enjoy and have loads of fun. It's safe and there are lots of staff monitoring the area. Remember to bring their swimwear though.

I would give the OCBC Skyway a miss. Not worth paying the money when the view from the ground up the Supertree Grove is just as amazing.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay,4,,"A nice morning out, weather was humid and the gardens were busy. It鈥檚 a spectacular visit in the evening although much busier.",,
,,Beautiful and relaxed,5,,A stunning environment with little treasures around each corner. Our 2 year old loved the water park and we loved the greenery and scenery,,
,,Very cool,5,,There鈥檚 lots to see and do at the gardens. They put on different temporary exhibitions that look incredible. The cloud forest is an amazing walk up the indoor waterfall. At night they play orchestral/opera music and do a lift display off the large manmade trees which can be seen from a distance too. It鈥檚 worth your while checking this out whilst in SG,,
,,beautiful,3,,it's a must to visit place in Singapore. good place to hangout and observe the light show. you can even have a walk on the high bridge.,,
,,Wonderful light show,5,,We didn鈥檛 have time to visit during the day so got there about 6pm in time to walk around the beautiful gardens. Hence did not do paid activity but was enough for us. Noticed space filling up around trees so sat down at 730 to wait for light show and so pleased we did. Stunning display for all ages and a highlight of our visit. Topped off with dinner at Satay by the Bay (Hawker style) which was also great. Note mass evacuation after light show so wait for taxi is rather long and a surcharge applies. Time your departure between shows!,,

,,One of my favorite places in Singapore,5,,This attraction is not to be missed if you are visiting Singapore. They have done a spectacular effort putting this world class attraction together. You can literally spend hours there and do it all for free if you want . The domes are paid entry but most of the area is free admission. It really is worth seeing for the sheer scale and size of this area. It is also worth going back at night and seeing the lights. Don鈥檛 miss it if you are visiting Singapore,,
,,Go when it's dark to enjoy the light show!,4,,I was advised to go around 5.30/6pm i.e. close to sunset so I could see the gardens during daylight and also in the evening once it is dark. The place really comes to life then with the super trees being lit up and also hosting...More,,

Such a brautiful garden, biggest naturepark of asia. Have beautiful two domes.

,,Just spectacular,5,,"The light show was spectacular. We did not expect the visual and music to be so fantastic, we could not take our eyes away.
Recommend getting there earlier to get a spot.
So many people made getting to the MRT very slow and we ended up catching a taxi.
Looking forward to seeing the rest of the gardens tomorrow.
One day is not enough.
Highly recommend it.",,
,,Beautiful gardens,5,,"A wonderful trip, beautiful fowers and waterfalls inside, spend a morning visiting and it flew by so quickly. Another night we visited the light show to music which was stunning and one of the highlights of our trip to Singapore.",,
,,it was amazing at the night time,5,,it was amazing at the night time. A very beautiful and big garden. I like the sky tree the most. There is a lighting show at night and I love it.,,
,,Refreshing,4,,Any visit to Singapore is incomplete if you don't visit the gardens. The entry is free for an outside round which is good.,,
,,The highlight of my Singapore trip,5,,"Wow, yes this is a must. If you like plants, waterfalls, trees and lights this one is a must. Allow plenty of time to explore this place (allow 3 hours). The light show in the evening is a magical experience. There is plenty to see in the gardens. A good time to visit is in the late afternoon, browse the domes and then head outside to watch the light show. The light show is free, but you have to pay for the cloud forest and flower dome (all in the same area).

A tip for bargain hunters, it is cheaper to buy a combined ticket for the flower dome and cloud forest. I bought my tickets from klook, they have some good deals for attractions in Asia. You will receive an email following purchase and you can use that to enter into the domes.

Happy saving and have fun ;)",,
,,Wonderful gardens,5,,"Teeming with beautiful flowers, amazing natural attractions (Supertree Grove, Cloud Forest), innovative landscaping and photo opportunities at every turn, you really must visit Gardens By The Bay if you're ever in Singapore. Free to enter the park but the attractions are paid for - either individually or altogether with an all-access ticket.",,
,,Lightshow.,5,,Watch the light show with the kids!! But ask someone what area its held.. We waited at the area where maccas is along with 100 other people.. but it was held on the other side... :(,,
,,Gorgeous,5,,"We have enjoyed the gardens, beautifully made and a good contrast to the city. The two domes are lovely. Tipp: We have gone their in the early morning (not many tourists there at this time of the day!). Although everybody told us there will be too many people, it was just perfect. Take your time to walk around the artificial trees as well.",,
,,More than what we expected,5,,Awesome not what we expected. Didn鈥檛 do walk but there for lights and music. Def go at night. It is absolutely a highlight,,
,,Beautiful place. Must visit in Singapore,5,,"This place is located right next to famous Marina Bay Sands hotel.
It鈥檚 beautiful man made garden. Easy to access , free to walk around. You only need to pay for ride in buggy and for entrance in cloud forest and flower dome- both places are great. In cloud forest it smell like rain (great for those who missed it like us living in Dubai)",,
,,An exclusive experieince,4,,"This place is not easy to replicate. They have done a wonderful of categorizing, naming and preserving in natural conditions. You can spend a whole day if you are really into it or an hour or two is enough to walk through.
And they have free WifI through out.

I wish they had more guide timings slot.",,
,,Incredible creation,5,,"Before my visit I knew very little about Gardens by the Bay except that all of the guide books recommended a visit. My only concern was that on the day we visited there were no clouds in the sky and the hot sun was merciless. I wondered how long we would last. But a huge surprise awaited us, with the two gardens within two enormous domes with air conditioning. The first dome that we visited was enchanting, with many varieties of flowers from a number of different continents. I was particularly impressed with the orchids, which were very colourful, and the cacti. We ended up spending two hours in that pavilion and then took a break for lunch. Returning to the Cloud pavilion, there was another impressive exhibition of the effect of water on plants. I am not particularly interested in gardening, but I do know how to recognize a top class exhibition, and this is one. You will not regret a visit.",,
,,Good attraction,5,,When i knew we were visiting Singapore this was one one of the places that i wanted to visit. We prebooked our tickets and paid for the two other domes. If you are interested in flowers then you will enjoy this attraction. They are very beautiful when lit up at night.,,
,,Loose yourself for a Day,5,,We spent a day and the evening at Gardens by the Bay and found there was something to discover and keep the kids entertained across the whole landscape!,,
,,A must see,5,,Gardens by the Bay is a must see especially if you love nature. They have the most gorgeous flowers in the domes and a water fall in the Cloud Forest. There are a variety of orchids in radiant colors and sizes. You can buy a ticket to include both domes which is worth it.,,
,,They really have created something beautiful here馃尮馃尯馃尰馃尲馃尫馃尨馃尩,5,,They really have outdone themselves over in Singapore and created something simply astounding. From the smallest of cactus to the giant Supertrees 馃槏馃槏 @wandering_gizmo on instagram for all my pics,,
,,Amazing achievement,5,,"Beautiful, peaceful and free Fantastic sound and light show each night highlighting an amazing engineering achievement.",,
,,Amazing,5,,"Better to go late afternoon. That way you can stay until it gets dark.
From the park, there is an overpass to the shopping centre, this is where you will get the best view for night photography.
It really is beautiful.
I enjoyed it more at night time. Everything lit up and changed colours. So beautiful.",,
,,Time waste - but if you have time go for it,4,,Highly rated place but if you go here you will find just malls and others surrounded fancy items no real beauty. Total time waste.,,
,,Surreal day out,5,,"We bought tickets for Cloud Forrest, Flower Dome and Skyway Walk and were not disappointed. The two indoor gardens are surreal and there is a huge variety of plant life inside. The Skyway Walk was good too but had to wait about 30 minutes to go up for only a short period of time.",,
,,During the day,4,,Also worth a visit during the day. Did not go into the buildings (loads of school groups) But enjoyed the walk through the beautiful park and very clean facilities. Beautiful location for $450m development,,

Please note that to visit Garden by bay, One does not need to purchase ticket. Ticket generally sold online are for walking on top and visiting exhibition. Separate ticket for above both activities are available at venue too.",,
,,Very quick visit,4,,Due to weather and time constraints we were very limited but the free walk around was very picturesque these gardens are very well maintained. Worth a visit,,
,,Not to be missed,5,,Definately worth a visit. Both the Cloud dome and Flower dome are an incredible mix of sights and smells. Not only are the planting鈥檚 incredible but I also enjoyed all the sculptures throughout. We made sure we were in the cloud dome for the misting which happens every two hours.Plenty of food outlets and toilets. We decided to pay extra for the little electric cart audio tour which whizzes you around the gardens in 25 minutes brilliant when it is raining.,,
,,Tour,5,,I highly recommend to go here 2x 1st inbthe morning to get nice picture and at night for the second it may be a little traffic but the lights and orchestra is superb the light n music show is very wonderful do come there before 8 to get a good spot to watch and video the lights and sound show! Hope this will help u and try to ride the limo taxi car its a wow experience,,
,,Absolutely amazing,5,,"Absolutely gorgeous display of plants & flowers together with beautiful sculptures. The temperature inside is a very comfortable mild (approximately 22deg), so it was easy fur us to wander through the displays for hours. Cloud Forest is also well worth a visit",,

,,beautiful place worth every penny,5,,"beautiful place worth seeing but need atleast 3-4 hours ,be prepared to walk a lot .go in the evening for the lighting shows",,
,,Spectacular,5,,Amazing experience. Especially the lighting show in the evening. Can get crowded and increasingly difficult to get a taxi after the show right away. So we decided to have dinner at small hawker center like food court nearby. Excellent satays. Must visit,,
,,Great Ambience,5,,We got the triple package for this place and it was well worth it! Day and night time viewing were spectacular! Hope to visit this place again soon,,
,,Woow,5,,"If u go to SGP, you must see this incredible place. Moreover I suggest to go there at 7.45 pm or 8.45 pm to admire the lightning show! You can also spend 8 dollars to go up over the Bridge connection through the trees.",,
,,Family friendly Garden by the Bay,5,,"I went to Garden by the Bay to recce for our company corporate social responsibility event. We are going to bring 20 underprivileged children for an outing and treat them to a lunch. So our top priority is their safety and fun. After deliberating about a few venue we finally choose Garden by the Bay taken into consideration for contingency plan due to the possibilty of wet weather and that this is a hot month of the year too. This is surely a great choice as there are covered walkway and greenery. Most importantly there is an outdoor playround and waterplay too with showering and locker facilities. And if it rain we still can bring them into the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. For our staff, this place is easily accessible by Bayfront MRT. As its National Day period the theme is Orchid. Wow!! I didnt know that there are over thousand species of Orchid so learnt quite a fair bit.",,
,,An absolute must-do in Singapore,5,,"One cannot leave Singapore without having seen the ""Gardens by the Sea"". The gardens themselves are great but the two domes are not to be missed. The flower dome as well as the cloudy dome are a unique and overwhelming experience. Also try to be there at night for the unforgettable light show!",,

,,Singapore,4,,nice place to visit during my stay in Singapore. it kept me awake after a 7:30 am arrival from the US.,,
,,Favorite attraction in Singapore,5,,"Grdens by the bay is an amazing attraction as if offers various activities within the same area. Moreover, there is a daily light show at 7 and 8 pm and its simply mesmerizing. It is not necessary to buy tickets to view the spectacle or to enter the gardens. Tickets are sold to visit temporary expositions or to go up to enjoy the view. I deffinitely recommend Gardens by the Bay by night.",,
,,Wonderful Huge Garden of the Wolrd,5,,"I am so happy to see lighting show of Garden by the Bay in the night. At that time there were many tourists and children. Also I am so glad that I can see Marina Bay Hotel clearly from this place. The area attracted many Garden choices and people should pay 68 SGD to enter the Garden inside. Well, personally I appreciated the infrastructure here due to its very friendly with all ages and difable or Senior Citizen. I loved it so much and fully recommended.",,
,,Fantastic!,5,,"Well worth a visit and one of the must sees when in Singapore. The domes are great and we spent quite a few hours in each one. The outside gardens are just beautiful and lovely to walk around with a small water park for kids to play in. The food options are limited but not too bad though a little expensive. We purchased dinner and stayed for the night light show. My tip would be to go later in the day and stay to watch the Light Show, they have two times and if you want a seat make sure you get there at least 45mins-1hour early. Alternatively, bring a blanket to sit on and you can sit on the ground and watch, there is plenty of room. I would visit there again.",,
,,Stunning place,5,,We visited on a relatively quiet day but despite being able to buy tickets it would have been a 1.5hr wait to go on the walkways so we had to skip it,,
,,The Opera in the Park light show was utterly incredible!,5,,We visited the gardens on one of the last nights of a year-long trip with our children. We were absolutely exhausted. What a wonderful experience to lay our tired backs on the warm concrete and watch the light show above us. Something we will never forget. Shouldn't be missed if you're in Singapore at night.,,
,,Worth a visit,4,,"Thought we鈥檇 spend an afternoon wandering around this beautiful park.
It cost $20 to go to the top of one of the sky trees. For this you got a soft drink and a fantastic view of Singapore.
For lunch we went to the satay restaurant where they serve some of the best satays in Singapore.",,
,,Lush green premises,5,,"It's lush and great for a walk. Really a symbol of the perfection omnipresent in Singapore. Catch the light and sound show, the coordination of which is really spectacular. It takes place at 7.45 and 8.45 in the evening. The Orchid extravaganza is also worth a see!",,
,,Park,4,,"Garden by the bay is a park. Nice to wonder around. To visit the trees are free. If you like to see inside the two dome, have to pay. Get there first, take time to wonder. Can always pay at the second entrance. Cloud forest is amazing. Some of the time there a light show at the trees. Don鈥檛 miss it.",,
,,Gardens out of this world!,5,,"You need at least 1 hour in each conservatory (Flower Dome and Cloud Forest). We were blown away by the abundance of flowers and plant life inside the 2 conservatories, as well as the layout and structures within. That waterfall in the Cloud Forest is worth the visit alone! We were amazed at how the curators managed to have so many of the varying flower species in bloom all at once. Also, DON'T MISS the 15 minute (free) Light and Sound shows at night (7:45 pm and 8:45m).",,

,,Amazing man made,4,,Very unique and pretty. Gardner鈥檚 and horticulturists will be impressed. Well presented and maintained,,
,,Once in a lifetime,5,,"This is the reason I came to Singapore. The Supertree Grove is absolutely incredible. As is the Cloud Forest and, to a lesser extent, the Flower Dome. Definitely go back to the Supertrees at 7:45pm or 8:45pm to catch the light show. The crowds are worth it!",,

Both the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are excellent.

You can take the train to Bayfront Station on the Circle Line. It is a short walk (15 minutes) to Gardens By the Bay ticketing area. Just follow the signs. You can also pay S$3 per PAX and take a shuttle too. S$28 for admission to both conservatories and another S$8 for the OCBC Skyway.",,
,,Remarkable Place,5,,"It's a very impressive place to have a walk around, with great views and greenery. The 2 domes that you have to pay to enter are well worth the money. Rhapsody by the Bay every evening is also definitely something you should be doing too.",,
,,Come here when there is a special event.,3,,"If you come here when there is no special event, there were no decoration so the place looks flat and have nothing except the flower. Come here near Christmas maybe to get a more colorful and lively place.",,
,,"Go, even if you don't like touristy places",5,,"If you like gardens, you'll love this. If you don't, go anyway. It gives a good insight into the Singaporean psyche (if nature hasn't provided what you want, build it).",,

,,Fabulous!,5,,"As one of the most popular visitor attractions in Singapore, I thought I鈥檇 be a little underwhelmed due to all the hype surrounding that fact but ... it really was brilliant! We went in the late afternoon through to the light show in the evening. Walking across the bridge from Marina Bay was pretty spectacular and exciting. It was busy, but not uncomfortably so, and there鈥檚 plenty to distract you from the crowds anyway. Personally, the Cloud dome was more interesting than the Flower one, but both are so well designed and maintained, with a plethora of interesting plants - and many other delights- that everyone is sure to find a favourite feature. Highly recommended!",,
,,A lot see & do,5,,There is a lot to see & do at a the Gardens By The Bay.The laser light & music show at night is well worth a visit on its own. The gardens & sculptures are very good too.,,
,,What a day!,4,,"We visited the cloud forest, the flower dome and the trees ( on the walkway) and stayed till sunset to see the sound and light show. I would have enjoyed the flower dome more had it not been full of people who were shouting and taking selfies. We saw a few people clearly interested in the plants but they seemed few and far between.
The cloud forest was also enjoyable and we were glad to have visited it.
It was really lovely to go up to the tree walkway and watch the sunset but best of all was the sound and light show. The tree really came into their own once it was dark.
We didn鈥檛 expect this to be the best part of our Singapore trip but it was. As we are not city people, we were rather underwhelmed by views of the city.
As most of the day was spent in a/c environments we experienced a lot more.",,
,,Fabulous,5,,"Well worth the entry fee to do the domes, magnificent displays of flowers and trees from all over the world. One of my top 5 picks of places to go in Singapore.",,

,,Lighting,5,,"Night time gardens lighting amazing for photography, We have enjoyed very much with our son, also supervision staffs are very calm and very friendly.",,
,,Man made garden paradise,4,,you are able to walk around the gardens without charge and only pay for the two indoor exhibits if you want to see then. great way to spend a few hours away from the traffic of Singapore. The two indoor pavilions are interesting but not worth the money in my view. I do not like man made rocks etc.,,
,,Indoor gardens,5,,It's incredible what they have done. Really couldn't believe it. This place is awesome for kids as well. It's great that they educate people on the environment and what's actually happening in the world. All in all awesome little self done tour. A bit loud though that's due to the tourists.,,
,,Beautiful!,4,,"A beautiful park to relax from the hustle & bustle downtown. Entrance fee for the flower dome, cloud forest and skyway. Eat at Sate at the bay before the light show. A definite 鈥榯o do鈥?when in Singapore.",,
,,Beautiful indoor gardens,5,,These indoor gardens are amazing! In combination with the indoor waterfalls it is an amazing! The only thing i did not like it was very crowded and have to wait on the que to get the entrance tickets for half an hour...,,
,,Garden Rhapsody,5,,"Absolute must visit if you're in Singapore. The Gardens by the Bay are magical day or night though morning or evening is preferable as it's not as hot as the afternoon. Lots of interesting gardens, lake features and of course the super trees. You can get some nice shots of Marina Bay Sands Hotel and Satay by the Bay is nice to go for somewhere to eat. I was able to watch the Garden Rapsody again this year though I think it is seasonal only.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,"It鈥檚 was a fantastic place in Singapore, Gardens by the Bay! There was a wide garden with a lots of trees, flowers and entertainment! We had an extremely experience in here!",,
,,Great Garden,5,,Absolutely amazing garden which is very well maintained with lot of new collection and one should not miss out this garden visit on their trip to Singapore.,,
,,Excellent Day Out,5,,"With advice from a friend we took swimming costumes with us so the kids could cool off in the splash area. The play park area beside it is also great for a run around. So glad we did, as they loved it!!! And it was free!!! We also only booked tickets for the cloud dome as I think my more would have been a bit boring for my kids. We timed it so that we saw the light show which for me was absolutely stunning. We arrived around 3pm. And left around 8.30pm after the light show.",,
,,beauty by the Bay,5,,"gardens by the bay may be the best place to visit in Singapore. Beautiful flowers ,waterfalls , different type of trees and very huge area.
It is better to visit in the evening around 3 30 and one can enjoy for 4 hours.
one can start from FLOWER DOME.with beautiful flowers of different sizes and colours.. then move to cloud forest .35 mt rman made mountain and water fall,very beautiful.
at OCBC skyway there is beautiful light and sound show at 7.45 and 8.45 pm .This show is not to be missed.
people sleep on grass and watch show of about 15 min.
then other gardens around these three main.
one can spend 5 hours here",,
,,Magnificent,5,,The highlight of my trip to Singapore. Must see if your in Singapore and have time. Then go back at night time when it is lit up,,
,,Wow,5,,"I didn't know what to expect when we visited the gardens. Supertree grove gives a great view of the bay and surrounding area, The flower dome was really fragrant with all the different plants, The cloud forest was a really nice walk just before sunset. there is a good conservation message at the end of the cloud forest walk. The cloud forest was favourite and really breathtaking",,
,,OMG,5,,Do not visit Singapore without going to the gardens. You don't even have to love plants to appreciate the wonder of just how they built these domes & what happens inside. A must see for every one & then return in the evening to watch the light & music show at the super trees.,,
,,Magic place to visit,5,,My wife and I just completed a visit to both the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest. Happened to catch the last day of the orchid extravaganza. What a magnificent place. Guaranteed to impress you. Quite spectacular all round - you can鈥檛 help enjoying it. We also had a meal inside the Flower Dome - great food and great service. Don鈥檛 miss it if you are in Singapore.,,
,,Straight out of the Avatar movie,5,,"A definite must-visit when you make a trip to Singapore, the Garden City! What makes this garden stand out from all the other gardens you may have visited around the world are the Avatar-inspired Supertrees which are covered with thousands of plants on them itself.

Pay $5 to go on the OCBC Skywalk where you can get a bird's eye view of the entire gardens and Singapore's marina bay area. Best to visit in the late afternoon/evening when the weather is cooler and especially because you'd want to catch the Garden Rhapsody light and music show at 745pm or 845pm daily where these Supertrees come to life.

Admission to the Gardens is free though you would not regret paying to visit the 2 domes - Flower Dome & Cloud Forest.",,
,,lovely park,3,,advisable to visit this place in the evening until 8/9 pm for LED show. staff were friendly and advised us to wait until night for the show. long walk.. please use suitable shoes,,
,,Fantastic,5,,"Had so much variety of plants and awesome wood carvings, a not to miss opportunity, thoroughly enjoyed it",,
,,A lovely morning,4,,"We loved garden in the clouds, very clever, lovely sculptures made from wood.

The views over Singapore bay splendid too.

The trees intriguing and fun.

A little disappointed with some area ie gardens of inheritance, didn鈥檛 feel amazing.

Would still recommend, however I personally love the Botanic gardens as far more mature and established.",,
,,2 in 1 highlights,5,,The theme is in orchids. You have the opportunity to see the beautiful orchids on display as well as all the other plants. I was there with my friends from Australia and we spent about 3 hours visiting both places.,,
,,A beautiful experience of light and sound!,5,,"If you are visiting Gardens by the Bay in Singapore, plan your visit to the gardens in a way so that you can wrap your evening with this beautiful show of light and sound scheduled daily at 7:45pm and 8:45pm at the Supeetree Grove. A very unique 15 minutes experience of light and sound, based on interesting themes and a must see attraction in Singapore.",,
,,Beautiful Gardens great service,5,,"Went to Gardens by the Bay and what a beautiful place. Even though there were quite a few people around it wasnt too crowded.

My mum has just had a knee replacement so we hired a wheelchair for $2.....wow how cheap is that. I was surprised. Everyone went out of their way to assist us and it was a beautiful spot to spend a couple of hours.

Your ticket also allows you to enter multiple times on the same day so we came back in the evening to see the huge trees lit up and they do a show at 7.45pm and 8.45pm and it is a light and sound show. Goes for about 20mins.

The audio tour is quite informative as well.

Overall well priced for a good day out!",,
,,Lovely place to go (Try to go around evening time 4 for best experience),5,,"I personally believe the best time to go to gardens is around evening, where you have plenty of time to see all the attractions when there is light and you can see the super trees being lit up at night. It is an awesome place to take a stroll. BTW, it actually looks like the pictures on the internet.",,
,,Reason enough to visit Singapore,5,,"Although pretty obviously inspired by the Eden Project in the UK these gardens are mighty impressive. Based in two big domes are the flower garden (a collection of zones and displays based on. You guessed it, flowers) and the cloud forest. The latter is the main attraction and be warned it gets very busy. You may have to queue to get (even if you have a ""skip the queue"" ticket as pretty much do does everyone else) and once inside there can be another line for the lift to the top of the dome. You don't *have* to do this but to be honest it is the main reason to visit. Just pick your day and time carefully.

Note that although the domes cost money there are a number of smaller gardens scattered around them which are free. One of these is a great splash park so bring your kid's swimmers.",,
,,Beautiful gardens,4,,The gardens present a great way to experience different zones while staying cool in steamy Singapore! Loved the waterfall and all the different areas of the two domes. Lots to see and do for self and the family.,,
,,What a surprise!,5,,I can't believe how special this project is. It was beautiful in every way. The weather inside the domes is pleasant. Walking the path is great for old and frail and young and energetic. It may be the best way to spend afternoon in Singapore.,,
,,An oasis of plants in a glass cage,5,,What a visit. Absolutely stunning what the Singaporeans have done to showcase the world鈥檚 plants and trees in huge environmentally controlled domes. Well kept and worth the price to visit. Children will love this.,,
,,Stunning floral display,5,,"Second visit so only explored the flower dome this time. It鈥檚 SGD$16 entry and well worth it! You can get a discount if you buy the Cloud Forest ticket with Flower Dome entry.
Easily can spend a couple of hours here. We visited in the morning before it got too busy. Night time is apparently a good time to visit too with all of the lighting displays.
Stunning floral displays, August featuring orchids. A colour explosion to enjoy!",,
,,Fantastic display,5,,"This is a beautiful display, especially the metal trees. You can pay $8 to go up an elevator to a walkway where you may stay for 15min. Great views and best thing: it doesn't sway!",,
,,Magnificent Gardens,5,,"These gardens are amazing, they are well designed, there are lots to see and well maintained. Is great to have the different zones to see.",,
,,Children鈥檚 play garden amazing!,5,,"If you have young family, make sure this place is on the list. It is free and there is a great water play area. Take your swimming costume! My 2 year old loved it.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"Has 2 areas. Outdoors & indoors

Outdoor
Supertree, Chinese garden, indian garden...
- beautifully manicured lawns and themed gardens, good for evenings or when weather is nice during the day

Indoor
Flower dome & cloud forest
Must to do if short of time and have to choose between the 2 areas
- one of the things to do during the sweltering hot day of Sg.
Feels like u r transported to a picture perfect oasis.
Cloud forest -tallest indoor waterfalls..imaginative pathway around what appears to be a picture perfect hill covered with tropical plants and flowers.
Flower dome
Fell in love with the variety and beauty of succulents I didn鈥檛 even know existed
Love the tulips exhibit that happens once a year during spring. Feels like escape to Netherlands for a little while. With forever changing exhibits, has something to offer all year round",,
,,Futurist garden. Artificial rain forest offers a view on the city.,5,,Must see in Singapore. Walking distance in the garden (shuttle also available) I loved the artificial rain forest. You go to level 6 with the elevator to enjoy the scenic view of Singapore downtown.,,
,,Amazing free park,5,,We saw this park on all the trip reviews and we were not disappointed the vision and imagination that greeted us on a day visit and a night trip to see the spectacular light show well worth a few hours if you can draw yourself from the shops...,,
,,Amazing,5,,"This was a great easy afternoon out having landed in the morning following 16 hrs of travel.

We did the cloud garden and the flower garden it was well worth the visit.

The light show was amazing trying the leave was a bit of a crush so I鈥檇 advise waiting for the crowds to die down first.

Entry prices were also decent.",,
,,Amazing!,5,,"I didnt expect much when I visited this place, but was left speechless. It is incredible. You must visit the cloud forest and flower dome, they cost a bit extra but worth it!",,
,,Well worth a visit,5,,Really pleasant place for a wander around although we didn鈥檛 visit the conservatories as quite expensive for a family of four. Did the tree top walk though which gave great views particularly of Marina Bay Sands Hotel.,,
,,Worth doing,5,,We decided to walk around the marina from our hotel and we take in the gardens. It鈥檚 was a great walk and we did the high walk for Sn$8 each which was short but well worth doing. We did not enter the conservatories as we deemed them too expensive and not overly exciting.,,
,,Beautiful,5,,I had no idea such beautiful creations existed. It's amazing what people can do to uplift a place when they put their heart into managing a country.,,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,"I visited Gardens by the Bay twice this month and I must say I was mesmerised by the beautiful colours of the foliage by night. Never did I think twice about photographing them. By day, the different varieties of orchids were on display. I happened to see one variety hybrid named after our ex-president Tony Tan Keng Yam. That was a discovery and so was one named after former President Barack Obama. The Gardens have a new theme each week and I was pleasantly delighted to see so many varieties of flowers on display including grapes and oranges. Surely, it was a worthwhile trip that will not disappoint any tourist.",,
,,Great visit,4,,"It鈥檚 so modern and vast and calm, the fresh air and the cabs make it a lovely visit! Great spot to catch great singaporian pictures!",,
,,Great Attraction,5,,"The Gardens By the Bay were a wonder to behold as it was orchid season. The many varieties displayed were wondrous and a joy to behold. There a couple of extra costs at this attraction, if you want to see/do everything.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"Simply stunning and a must visit in Singapore, there is so much to see and do, plenty of places to get refreshments while in a beautiful futuristic setting",,
,,Even if your not green fingered 馃尡,5,,"For those who arnt into gardens or nature in general, I鈥檇 still suggest going to the gardens for its architecture and landscaping! Especially at night! This place looks incredible, plus if your lucky you may spot the local Otters 馃槏",,
,,Do the Cloud Forest,4,,There are 2 domes to visit - the cloud forest and the flower domes. I recommend the Cloud Forest first as it鈥檚 the more interesting one with a lift to the top and then a walking descent back to base with some good views. And lovely and cool. The Flower dome is vast and rambling and I鈥檓 sure is equally impressive if you鈥檝e not visited Kew Gardens in London which we have and much preferred. There鈥檚 also plenty of outdoor gardens to meander through and a sky walk but we found it too humid to spend any length of time walking outside in August.,,
,,Beautiful place,5,,This place is absolutely stunning. They had the Orchid Show at the time and it was so beautiful. Entry is free but you have to pay in some of the places within. All the flowers were so beautiful and we strolled around for a good few hours. Located within Marina Bay so highly recommend. Would have liked to visit at night time as I was told they have light shows but we didn't have time.,,
,,Plan a whole day for that area :),5,,The gardens are big. Even without visiting the greenhouses there's plenty to see - and make sure to check garden's rhapsody in the evening quarter to eight!,,
,,Must see in Singapore,5,,Honestly an amazing experience. I would recommend to visit gardens by the bay at the afternoom i.e 5-6 pm and stay until 8p.m to enjoy the show. Find the spot you like most and enjoy the views.,,
,,Glorious greenery,5,,"Was lucky enough to see the Orchid Extravaganza display in the Flower Dome which had more than 14,000 plants from 120 varieties interspersed with elements from local Peranakan culture. The Cloud Forest Dome with it鈥檚 impressive waterfall & delightful wooden carvings scattered around contained a wide variety of plants. Then there are the surrounding themed gardens & lake encircling the most well known area - Supertree Grove & the OCBC Skyway. But wait ... there鈥檚 more! Come back at 19:45 or 20:45 to watch the beautiful light & sound show that plays each night - was spectacular",,
,,Very nice!,5,,"We really enjoyed Gardens by the Bay.

We had the opportunity to be presented with the lights and music shown. It happens everyday around 09:45pm.
It's such a show!!! Wonderful!!! All the lights dancing and changing colours according to the rithm of the music.

Really beautiful!!

Didn't have tge chancr to visit the gardens during the day, just at night.",,
,,Nice evening walk,4,,Nice place to get exercise with lovely view. Keep walking and enjoying the various flowers and plants with various fragrance.,,
,,"Loved this place, especially the musical Garden Rhapsody",5,,"The Gardens by the Bay are wonderful and a great place for kids and adults alike to explore.I am not sure what the domes are like because we felt they were too expensive for a family of 4 when the Botanical Gardens are so beautiful and free. We eat at the Satay which was good food.
We came back in the evening and really really loved the Garden Rhapsody. The lights were set to opera, which we loved and even our children enjoyed. We wanted to go again but never made it back but would recommend the gardens by night and day to anyone.",,
,,Serene and calm place,5,,Booked through klook so the entry was cake walk with M-tickets. Do not miss the sound and light show and don't hesitate to go flat on the pavement,,
,,A lovely experience,4,,"And free. We went in about six o鈥檆lock, gave up on the skywalk, too many queuing and one and a half hour wait, similar with the bar up the supertree.The rest of the gardens very nice to walk round and the lights and music-waltz theme on our visit - were great. Satayon the Bay good for hawker style food. Long walk to leave andsigning, just like the Botanic Gardens, not always reliable.",,
,,Good sound and light show in the evening.,4,,One should go to this place in late evening as the light and sound show is good and worth being to. Its complete with natural flower plants on a tree like structure made of steel.,,
,,Beautiful gardens,5,,A great way to while a way a morning or afternoon in Singapore. We were lucky to be there during the orchid festival and they were truly beautiful. I enjoyed the fantastic sculptures as much as the plant life. Be sure to visit the cloud forest where there are some really fascinating plants but if you don鈥檛 like heights beware of the walk round the outside! Very easy to get to and plenty of transport to get back to the city centre.,,
,,"Well worth the exercise, visually stunning.",5,,"The public access gardens are worth visiting in their own right. You have the super trees which are interesting in daytime but truly come to life at night with spectacular light shows. Then you have the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest, each quite different, but displaying nature鈥檚 diversity and magnificent colours in beautifully sculpted and maintained environments. Make the time to visit!",,
,,"Magical setting! Crowded, but a must see!",5,,"The famed SuperTrees of the Gardens by the Bay are a must see, especially during the evening lightshow! The magnificent man-made tree structures are illuminated with brilliant colors with the wonderful backdrop of the Marina Bay Sands. Arrive early to be able to get a seat of a good spot for the show, otherwise it does get very crowded. Also, be sure to get your tickets for the Skywalk and head to the line early if you鈥檙e wanting to get onto the bridge during the show. Note that the queue for the bridge could be up to an hour, which was the case when we were there. Up on the bridge security really controls the movement just so that the queue line moves quickly, so don鈥檛 expect significant time to be able to take so many photos. Which means you really need to make your shots count . If you鈥檙e wanting the best panoramic view/shot of the SuperTrees, definitely get to the viewing deck /roof gardens of the Marina Bay Sands.",,
,,Man made garden,4,,It was very hot to walk outdoor during the day so it's better to come in the evening. The entrance is free for the park but tickets for the 2 domes were pricey.,,
,,Beautiful gardens,5,,"The gardens are spectacular, with in walking distance from the centre of the city. Everything is beautifully maintained. We walked back at night for the light and music show, a must for everyone who visits.",,
,,Interesting place to visit,4,,"This wasn鈥檛 one of our best activities during our stay in Singapore but we enjoyed wandering around the domes, looking at the incredible orchids and seeing how well it was all designed and laid out. The indoor waterfall was fantastic. We were a little worried how they鈥檇 taken stalagmites from caves somewhere to show half way up the waterfall",,
,,Beautiful Gardens,5,,"These gardens were beautiful! We arrived a little before sunset, walked to the Cloud Forest exhibit (worth the price and were able to pay for just that conservatory) and saw the sunset while inside, and then went to the super trees right as it was getting dark. We were there in time for the nightly symphony show which was really fun to watch and then went up to the skywalk and had great 360掳 views of the city. It was definitely worth the money and very fun. I also really liked all of the educational conservation efforts within the gardens, especially in the cloud forest conservatory. As a tourist, I wish I had more time in my schedule. As a biology teacher, I wish I could take my students here (but it鈥檚 a little far from NYC for a field trip).",,
,,Great visit absolutely stunning,5,,"This was a surprise, I am not really a flower or garden sort of person so when I went on this tour I was thinking mixed thins , however when I got there and did the gardens and the 2 domes , it was stunning and worth every penny, you will not be disappointed",,
,,A must do,5,,This place is magnificent. A must do in Singapore. Spent day here exploring gardens and flower dome and rainforest dome. Walked above the trees and watched light show at night. A real treat. One of the things I recommended every one who visits Singapore to do. They also have a waterpark area for kids if u are visiting with children so they can cool down and play.,,
,,A good visit,4,,"We put this place in our agenda in our holiday in Singapore and we were not disappointed. The supertree grove, flower dome and cloud forest were fantastic. Night light show in supertree grove was amazing even though it was really packed, so make sure you are on the right spot long before it starts.

If you travel with young kids, make sure that you all travel in pack, keep your eyes on your group. Leaving Gardens by the Bay at night after the show could be a bit scary with hundreds of people moving at the same time.",,
,,Fun times,5,,Just a great place to visit whilst staying in Singapore or just visiting for a day or 2. The light shows are really amazing,,
,,Amazing!,5,,"Amazing views and gardens. Great place to visit and realx. We highly recommend a visit to the gardens. Bring water with you, be hidrated in a hot day.",,
,,"Awesome Experience, Brilliant Displays",5,,"What an absolutely magnificent day we spent here, plenty to see, colourful displays from all corners of the globe. You can spend hours & hours here and still not see all that is on offer. Plants and flowers all arranged by country origin in an air conditioned and humidity controlled environment. Loved the Themed exhibits from Poo bear, Alice in wonderland to the Octopuses garden and many more.Very interesting sculptures & figures throughout the displays!",,
,,Briiliant,5,,"A place you must visit as there is so much to see, the domes are absolutely amazing, you can walk miles around the grounds & the shows in the evening top off an enjoyable day",,
,,Nice Experience,4,,"Its is really great to see that entire area that includes the FlowerDomes, SupertreeGrove, Children's Park, but you need to walk a lot.

It will be really good if there can be some way of transport for the families with Kids, or may be strawler !",,
,,Enjoyed the children鈥檚 section,4,,The children鈥檚 area is excellent - and free. There鈥檚 a water area for 2-12 year olds which is fun: lots of spraying water (worth taking a change of clothes). There鈥檚 also a brilliant playground kids can explore. Food options are boring and a bit over priced- better to bring your own picnic. A great couple of hours for kids.,,
,,An amazing botanical garden,5,,"The Cloud Forest dome and skywalk took our breath away and the Flower Dome had a main display of orchids which was just fantastic, but the permanent gardens had some stunning displays too, especially the cactus and succulents. It is busy, but everywhere in Singapore is, and lines are efficiently run and fans and aircon provide cool breaks. If you have kids, take the swimmers and a towel, the waterpark in the children's garden gives them a fun cool down. We did it after the Cloud Forest and lunch and it was a good break to do before the next dome and then Skywalk on our way to the MRT to come home. The structures are amazing, the plantings are incredible, and it is a must visit for Singapore!",,
,,Amazing light show each evening.,5,,"Really enjoyed visiting Gardens by the Bay for the light show.Allow plenty of time as this is a large garden & there are lots of different areas to see. Well worth a visit,",,
,,"Excellent, Beautiful Place",5,,Good place to hangout close to creek & Marina Bay Sands. A huge man made garden & calm breeze flows across the place. Acceptable dining options as well. Only drawback is you have to walk more than 500-600m for the nearest MRT station.,,
,,Don鈥檛 miss seeing the light show,5,,Amazing place with plenty to see at a nice leisurely pace. We timed our visit so that it ended after the 7.45 light and music show. Crowds gather quite early under the Supertree grove and there is very limited seating so we sat on the ground,,
,,Nice place,4,,Well built and interesting place to visit. Recommend to visit the domes during the day and walk around in the gardens that has nice light and music operation every 30-45 minutes.,,
,,Fantastic!,5,,A must in Singapore. Something for everyone and sights you'll not see anywhere else. Fantastic way to spend an afternoon. The light show is spectacular!,,
,,Wow what an attraction and setting in central Singapore,4,,"Easily accessible from Bayfront MRT station. Wonderful sculptures and plenty of flowers and trees in a wonderful setting, right by Marina Bay Sands and the Singapore River across from Singapore Flyer. The two conservatories Cloud Forest and Flower Dome are available at a cost of S$28 and are well worth the cost and the pleasant atmosphere. My suggestion is to hunt out Satay by the Bay, a collection of restaurants and food outlets serving obviously Satay but a great variety of different foods including BBQ Seafood, Rice and Dumplings, Thai, Burgers and deserts.",,
,,Amazing day out !,5,,This is not to be missed. The supertree light show is free and is one of the most amazing sights iv ever seen!,,
,,Impressive,5,,"If you go to gardens by the bay, you must visit the flower dome and cloud forest, they are full of plants, trees and flowers!! It was an amazing day getting to see and take pictures there!",,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,"The Gardens by the Bay are well worth a visit, there is plenty to see so wear comfortable shoes for walking around.",,
,,Magnificent,5,,Totally stunning and unique. Must see. It's fantastic and brilliant. Nothing more to say. Please lower the 100 character minimum please or I will write less of these.,,
,,Very nice indeed !!,5,,"Went to gardens by the bay after hearing a lot about it an yes it鈥檚 really nice beautiful lights around the city really enjoyed them

Recommend going about 30 mins befor starting times because it fills up pretty fast and you do want to get a good view",,
,,A great escape into a garden paradise,4,,Always a joy to retreat into the beautifully landscaped Flower Dome at the Gardens by the Bay and lose my cares in the cool garden blooms. A definite stress buster!,,
,,Worth the time,5,,Loved this attraction especially the Super trees and Flower dome. Everyone was really friendly and the gardens amazing. Get there earlier enough to enjoy the whole place and time to get a spot early by the super trees as gets really crowded.,,
,,"Surreal, beautiful, amazing",5,,"Wow, this place is utterly mind-blowing!
I was really excited to go here and it was such a great experience I have to say. I got a ticket to see the Super tree grove where you can go up in the man made trees, that was my favourite. But so high up and quite scary.
I got tickets to the cloud garden and everything else, well worth the money.
I left feeling as though I was in a dream or something it was all so surreal. It was architecturally stunning and It it well worth visiting in the day and night as they do a light show at 8pm and 9pm.
You have to do it, do all of it it will not disappoint.",,
,,Amazing at night,4,,"We went around 6 in the evening. This is recommended for the free gardens and seeing things from the ground at night when lit up. If you want to go into any of the domes or sky tour do not go at this time as the lines are so long and they鈥檙e are so many people around which make it really hard to see anything without pushing in to see. Had a family member go in the morning and had an enjoyable stroll and saw everything with no lines.

Amazing upgrade to Singapore. Wouldn鈥檛 see elsewhere.",,
,,Airconditioned garden in the city centre,5,,"You can choose either to pay to enter two domes or to walk around outdoor areas. Even if you are not a big fan of gardens, try to catch a free ""super tree show"" at night!",,
,,Beautiful place to spend time!,5,,You can choose to spend some money to go inside the domes or you can just have a great walk in the park. We spend the evening on Singapores National Day 9th of August. That was the place to be then. Great shows. silent disco - fun. Different restaurants to choose from if you prefer to eat. Something for everyone. Effective taxiservice even it was crowded.,,
,,Go to light night show,5,,"Absolutely amazing! The main park is all free and we decided not to get any of the paid tickets (into the exhibits) but we still had an amazing time! We walked through the Chinese, Indian, and Malay gardens and watched the Rhapsody Light Show at the SuperGrove 鈥?absolutely breathtaking (shows are at 7:45 and 8:45 every night). A must see while in Singapore.",,
,,Amazing stroll through the park!,5,,It was very relaxing to walk through and take in the beautiful scenery. There is a park towards the end of the Garden where we saw flying kites and you could see the Marina Bay Sands hotel from there - good to go near sunset.,,
,,Beautiful place,5,,Cloud forest is the best place in this place. It is very pleasant walking round the cloud forest. Must watch place,,
,,The flower domes are expensive for what they are,4,,"The two domes being the flower garden and the lost world are amazing (no doubt ) but they are extremely busy and very expensive for what they are. A family of three was $86 SGD so getting up there, a nice walk in the gardens outside would provide just as much satisfaction for someone with limited knowledge of flora and fauna. If you are very much into it then i would concede it would be a do not miss activity.",,
,,"Flowers, Plants & Waterfall",4,,"If u love seeing the flowers and plants and cool urself down with the breeze of aircon and waterfall, this is the place.
U can choose to go to both domes (Flower n Cloud) at a cheaper price then hang around the waterplay for ur small ones before heading to OCBC Skyview at a fee too. Go in the late afternoon so that you can experience the sound of music in the centre arena at 2 timings (740pm n 840pm). Few restaurants and 2 fast food places for u to choose frm for ur lunch or dinner.",,
,,arulio.arifin,5,,I just watched the light show and it awesome! I feel like in another space. Recommend for u guys to spend time!,,
,,Absolutely Gorgeous - Must Visit in Singapre,5,,We stayed at the MBS right next to the Gardens. We visited the flower dome and cloud forest (skyway was closed due to weather) and they were spectacular. Absolutely a must visit when in Singapore.,,
,,Feels like Fantasy in the City,5,,One of my favorite place.. We would lay down and watch the lights and sounds at night and the place is absolutely amazing! Its agreat place to walk around and appreciate nature. A nice place to walk around or relax after spending time in the city.. there are places to eat after a long walk... Close to the metro and marina bay sands hotel. Truly an amazing place to visit.. Its breathtaking! Will never get tired goin back to this place.,,
,,A must visit,5,,The night light show was really amazing...... I really love it. This is one of the most visit place in Singapore.,,
,,Wow!,5,,Wow! Amazing place! Really enjoyed walking around the cloud forest in particular. The flower dome was very pretty also. My kids enjoyed the child's areas also. My only criticism is that it's really packed.,,
,,Must see,5,,it will surprise you how it is as beautiful as you see it in the photos and hollywood movies. definitely a must see,,
,,spectacular at night,4,,A good attraction with plenty to see and walk. Looks great during the night light show. a must visit!,,
,,Wonderous Sight.,5,,Highly recommend a visit here. Amazing to see lit up at night adjacent to Marina Bay Sands. Something you don't get to see every day that's for sure.,,
,,Excellent park,5,,"Bright, interesting park with excellent walk across the tree tops. Good during the day even more eye catching when lit up in tbe evening",,
,,Amazing Green Thumbs,5,,"You can only marvel at the spectacle and appreciate the talent that the people behind this venture must have. Not having the eyesight of more youthful people, it was a little difficult to figure out the pricing to be able to look at all the different options for viewing, but even if you opt for the freeview only you will see plenty. Just wear comfortable walking gear and light clothing. If you catch a taxi to here, some of the cabbies will try and tell you that going to the gardens is not a good option as it has just been sprayed for mozzies and will urge you to go to Chinatown instead (for obvious reasons). Ignore them and insist on going to your chosen destination.",,
,,EXCELLENT,5,,"I do not use excellent often but this is one of those times .
the flowers are just out of the world .There are two parts to the Gardens one is a waterfall that you go up to the top and then come down easy. You go up in the lift and down on the escalators.I
The best part is it is air conditioned .
The second part is also spectacular orchids the more orchids and beautiful flowers also theme gardens .from allover the world .
THIS IS A MUST DO",,
,,Sensational,4,,Sensational and well worth a visit. Take a nice stroll on a less hot day and take in all the ambiance.,,
,,Spectacular,5,,"Singapore is beautiful and the Gardens By the Bay are consistently magnificent. I remember as a child being dragged through Gardens with my parents. My children were mesmerised as if we were visiting a fairyland. It is a magical, tranquil place.",,
,,Awesome Gardens,5,,"Definitely well worth a trip to the gardens.
The place is fantastic!
Your ticket is valid all day so if you want to get out of the Singapore humidity & heat go & spend a couple of hours down here! Then you can go back at night & enjoy it all over again as it is so beautiful to see the difference between night & day!!
Well worth it!!!
After strolling around at night check out the amazing Super trees all solar powered!!
Magnificent!!",,
,,One of Singapore's icons,5,,"The two domes are spectacular, with a wide variety of plant life, and provide welcome relief from the heat. But don't overlook the outdoor areas completely, as they provide an opportunity to learn more about the region..",,
,,A MUST!,5,,"Our son lives in Singapore and the Gardens were the first and place he took us as there is so much to see and do. Not sure we have come across anything like it anywhere, then again there is nowhere quite like Singapore! The gardens themselves with the backdrop of the magical Marina Bay hotel are a great place to wander if you can stand the heat, however it is the trees and the domes which offer the most amazing sites and photo opportunities. However short your time in Singapore make sure you go here!",,
,,Awesome Park with many attractions,5,,"Gardens by the bay is a 鈥歁ust see鈥?in Singapore. There are so many attractions, the flower garden (such different, powerful colors), the rainforest (I actually would have not be surprised, when Elves would fly around), the trees ... and many more.
All is well organized, (public transport, drinking water stations, clean restrooms) although there are a lot of visitors. I definitely recommend this!",,
,,Worth visiting,4,,"I'm not into gardens, but this one is truly beautiful. One can easily spend an hour or two walking through the area wondering the garden. High recommendation.",,
,,Great!,4,,We paid to get the audio tour and enter the flower dome. Audio tour was informative and meant you didn't have to walk around in the heart which was ideal. Flower Dome was great and the other done looked great too. Definitely worth a visit,,
,,Great fun for all ages,5,,"We鈥檝e visited the Gardens by the Bay on several visits to Singapore and it never fails to entrance us. We love wandering through the Supertree Grove and admiring the amazing metal trees and the cloud mountain is spectacular. It鈥檚 also very educational, with lots of info about sustainability and how the whole complex is self sustaining. On this visit, as we had a 3 year old with us, we visited the children鈥檚 garden and discovered the exciting water park, with lots of spray fountains, as well as a well spaced out play area hidden behind the seating. The evening lights display is worth staying for too.",,
,,Day out at Gardens by the Bay,5,,I loved the orchid display that day. The Peranakan displays were also very colourful and interesting. Looking forward to the next display.,,
,,Impressive little island country,5,,"It was only a short trip, I've visited the iconic Merlion, garden by the bay etc. As you can see iin my photos, everywhere is so well maintained and clean. It's a beautiful little country.",,
,,Really out of the world experience,5,,"It has a varied spaces of flowers, plants and trees. Loved it a lot. It has 2 domes - flower dome & cloud forest, its really nice and not to speak about the breath taking music and light show at the gardens in the night. Overall the experience was fabulous.",,
,,Amazing Park :),5,,Amazing botanical experience :) Beautiful flowers and the big trees are incredible. The different environments are very good recreated. Don鈥檛 miss it.,,
,,Fantastic,5,,We hadn鈥檛 done much research before we visited so we鈥?were surprised at how great this was. Advise getting in early and doing the two main domes before the masses arrive as once it is crowded it is harder to get good photos. We then did the 20min audio tour in the buggy which is excellent in the heat. We went back in the evening for the light show which is worthwhile.,,
,,Very pleasant,5,,"Very nice walking space, even though crowded due to the national day fireworks. Would return again to view more.",,
,,good place to visit,4,,This is a must see in Singapore. Good variety of plants and flowers .Nice cool atmosphere in the flower dome and lots to see when you wondering a round. must see the sound and light show in the evening.,,
,,Awesome,5,,Excellent place to bring my Overseas friends to showcase the fun Singapore has to offer. Most comfy attraction when it gets a little too hot and humid in Singapore 馃憤馃憤馃憤,,
,,Fabulous,5,,Pretty and wonderful experience. Better to visit during weekdays! It is a very good place to visit with friends and family.,,
,,Garden By The Bay,3,,"The entrance to the Visitor Centre need to be improved greatly.

The entrance is just at the traffic junction with 1 lane turning left to the entrance of Visitor Centre.

And if you keep left, the lane will lead to the basement carpark gantry entrance. If keep right, driver has to ""fight"" for lane with vehicles turning right from the junction from the opposite carriageway.

This access road is heavily congested as the tourist coach buses and taxi also enter from this entrance.

Just after the basement carpark entrance is the drop-off point and further front is the taxi stand and coaches/tour bus drop-off.

Garden By The Bay need to improve on the traffic management and location of the various vehicle type drop-off point to avoid congestion.",,
,,A must-see,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is breathtaking. It is free to walk around - the only charges are for the two domes. Go during the week if you can, because weekends are very busy.",,
,,WOW,5,,"Amazing! A must see for anyone, even if you are not interested in gardens or plants. Amazing. The only downside is the sheer number of other tourists with their selfie sticks swinging. Quite a busy place at times, but well worth it.",,
,,Magical,5,,"Magical as always. Cloud Forest's waterfalls is as majestic as ever. Plus, the mist at 8pm made it perfect. The variety of plants in Flower Dome always amazes me. It's like travelling the whole world's garden.",,
,,Great place to visit,5,,"This is well worth a trip to see it and so much to see

Also go and see the light show which start at 7.45pm and 8.45pm
This is all free

But be warned that the noght shows are really busy
We went on a Saturday night and it was heaving with people",,
,,Amazing especially at 9pm,5,,"The gardens by the bay are a beautiful place to walk around, spend hours of relaxation and chill. Every night at 9 pm you can watch an amazing lightshow there. This is an unforgettable experience for solo travelers as well as for couples or business travelers. Moreover the gardens by the bay have a great location next to the Marina Bay Sands and some wonderful sightseeing attractions in the city. You may want to watch the light show and then go to the ""ce la vi"" rooftop bar of the marina bay sands. Pay 20 dollars for the entrance and get a voucher of the same amount which you can spend at the bar. From there you will have the perfect view over the amazing city of Singapore.

This was an unforgettable evening for me.",,
,,Excellent,5,,The nature is fresh and nice. There are many strange flowers and plants. The orchid is wonderfulThe places is nice and clean,,
,,Family time together,5,,"Nice variety of plants, flowers and more.Though the place is hugh, food and beverages were easily accessible Kids had wonderful time exploring and running around. The cool atmosphere in flower dome and cloud forest are good for the mood.Overall good experience, except for the crowd when leaving, which is inevitable",,
,,A Have to see,5,,This is a have to see when in Singapore. The architecture is spectacular and the gardens are just the best I have ever seen. Do not miss this,,
,,Wow,5,,"I am just in love with the entire concept and took lots of photos that have inspired friends, colleges, students and family. All want to come visit.",,
,,Spectacular! PAndora on Earth,5,,"Must see, these gardens are earth's version of Pandora in Avatar movie. See them at night time for maximum impact.",,
,,Must See - Some Tips,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is a must-see. I鈥檓 really not a botanical person, but the appeal here is far more.
Cloud Forest (to me) was by far the most interesting place. I鈥檇 suggest you go to this attraction first and spend most of your time here. We found Many outstanding photo places. You may have to wait for people to move to get the optimal selfie/wefie. People were very helpful in offering to help take a picture
Flower Dome was nice, but I鈥檇 suggest you take it if you have time. If you are into flowers, you will be in heaven.
Important note, if you are going on the OCBC Skyway, plan accordingly. They closed this off due to rain. You might completely miss out if there is a passing rainstorm (common on Singapore).
Lastly, there is an evening concert. I thought this was a Must See, and it just happened by accident. Excellent light and music show. Among the best I鈥檝e seen.
Lots of walking (far more than we thought). Bring your most comfortable walking shoes.
Don鈥檛 let the high ticket prices put you off. This is very well done.",,
,,Must Visit Tourist Attraction,5,,"This is a must visit place, you can easily spend couple of hours and take plenty of snaps. A worth visit place, and you feel refreshed seeing the beautiful flowers. The light show in the night is also very nice. Don't miss this place if you are visiting Singapore.",,
,,A beautiful blend of city and garden,5,,This is the most beautiful blend of city and garden that I've ever seen. It feels and looks like a city in the future.,,
,,Breathtakingly Beautiful,5,,A definite must - best option to go by taxi - they drop you right outside the main entrance - less walking. Another great option is OPO - a bike hire service which gives you access to riding along the bay.,,
,,One of the nicest attraction around,4,,One of the nicer area in Singapore for tourists and locals. Great for couples or families. A lot of walking at the area. Wear comfy clothes and shoes.,,
,,Gorgeous gardens well maintained worth a visit.,5,,Go early in the morning before the heat as you will probably do a lot of walking. Make sure to visit the two paid enclosed gardens as they are worth the money. Easily accessed by the MRT train system and close to the Marina Bay shopping centre which has an affordable and delicious food hall.,,
,,Beautiful Experience ...,5,,"I have been to Gardens by the Bay several times and have enjoyed every single time. Every time I visited Gardens by the Bay, I have always been to Flower Dome and Cloud Forest conservatories. Taking a walk inside the conservatories is really beautiful and pleasing to the eyes. The colors of flowers and the way they come together is magical. There are plenty of photo spots through out both the conservatories if you're looking to create a perfect picture with a colorful background :)

I've always been to Gardens by the Bay with family members and guests. Everyone always enjoyed the trip. If you are lucky with the weather then the walks outside can also be quite enjoyable.",,
,,Beautifully created gardens,5,,"These gardens are temperature controlled so ensure maximum blooming capacity for their plants and they are gorgeous. There is usually a line to get in to the feature gardens but it moves quickly and even though the gardens are busy, you can still get close enough to the flowers for some amazing pictures. There is also a light show every night where 鈥榯rees鈥?light up in coordination with music. Worth a visit and I would go in the afternoon to enjoy both the gardens and the light show.",,
,,Good,4,,Good experience to be here. Cloud forest and flowers dome is nice. Light and sound show is overhyped but good. Ocbc skywalk gets a good long que. even after having tickets could not visit as it got closed.,,
,,"Well worth a visit, but maybe in two sessions.",5,,"This is such a large area to visit in one go and get the most out of it.

We made the decision to visit the main gardens and domes during the day and come back for the super tree grove and skywalk in the evening, which seemed to work for us.

The domes and gardens offer an interesting and wide selection of plants and displays, and even with the crowds you can still find somewhere to sit and relax in the gardens.

Probably the only downside is the cost of admittance for the domes, so if you are on a budget the gardens are free and well worth the visit alone.

However, the stars of the show are undoubtedly the skywalk and super tree light show, and even with over an hour wait for the skywalk they are a must to seen at night!",,
,,Amazing,5,,"There is a lot to do there, but we chose to just walk around the garden. What a gorgeous experience!! Walk around and take in the trees. I recommend doing in the early evening to beat the heat and the crowds. There is a lightship around 20h00, so bring a blanket or something to sit on and relax and enjoy. It's easier to watch you are laying down than if you are sitting down. If you have the time, go up to the Big Tree and have a cocktail. You can also have dinner there, but then I recommend making a reservation well ahead of time. Dinner is pricey and the place fills up fast.",,
,,a night at the opera !!,5,,We could see this from out hotel room. The light display was amazing. It is completely free to walk around the gardens and see the magical musical lights display.,,
,,Beautiful,5,,Beautiful. I don鈥檛 regret it. It鈥檚 a long walk but at the end it鈥檚 very worth it. For nature lovers and not at all for the Lazy. It鈥檚 breathtaking,,
,,Loved the cloud dome,5,,We enjoyed the cloud Dome . Wasn鈥檛 a fan on the flower dome to be honest. The views from inside are great,,
,,Great for an early morning run or walk,5,,A really lovely place to take a refreshing morning walk or run before the days heat begins to set in. Plenty of marked trails and points of interest on the way.,,
,,Green !!,5,,I loved this place and i take a lot of time in here. It鈥檚 the most iconic Singapore. The Flower Dome is the best of singapore.,,
,,Cool,5,,It鈥檚 so cool to go to gardens by the bay. It鈥檚 probably the most iconic Singapore attraction! It鈥檚 definitely worth while going and everything in it is so cool! Just be aware that if you buy tickets online you also have to get tickets to do the skywalk,,
,,Must see after dark,5,,"This is absolutely stunning and a must see at night. A beautiful place to walk around in the evening. However, I saw the flower exhibit the last day and it was too crowded and felt very artificial, I would not pay to go into the domes unless you were looking for a reason to get out of the heat. The Botanical Garden during the day is a better choice.",,
,,Beautiful place!,4,,"There is a lot to see!, visited Cloud Forest Dome and and the tree walk with my 10yo daughter, it took us about 3 hours including getting to and from the MRT station on the handy tram / bus ($).",,
,,Like a Dream!!,5,,I loved this place and it took my breath away with the way it was laid out and presented! Breathtaking colours and variety of different plants from around the world! The orchids in the Flower Dome were stunning! I am so glad to have gone and also checked out the light display at 7:45pm at the SuperTree Grove! A must do in Singapore!!,,
,,Amazing place!,5,,Well worth a visit to these beautiful gardens. The Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are not too be missed. Worth the $28 entry. Very interesting to wander though the domes and a great place to escape the humidity for a while. Unfortunately we didn't make it back in the evening for the light show. Recommend you see these gardens if visiting Singapore,,
,,So beautiful!,5,,"What an incredible experience this was.

We went at night, in favour of seeing the light show. The only thing I wish we had realised, is that that some of the conservatories close at a certain time, so we unfortunately missed seeing these due to arriving at 7.30pm. We were also unable to go up on the high ledge because of the time it took to get up there and the light show was starting at 7.45pm. However, we still went to the base of the trees and everyone was laying on the ground ready for the light show to begin at 7.45. It was so lovely and well worth it, even from the ground. I will definitely bring my kids back and come a little earlier this time so we can also see the conservatories as well.",,
,,do not miss the light/sound show in the evening with the super trees,4,,"On our visit, there was a special japanese garden exhibitions The cherry blossoms were a dream. Besides this, we found the 2 domes nice to look at, but did not rave about it . The super tree light/music show at night was spectacular though. Arrive at least 10 minutes before the show starts for the best view. After the show, many people were looking for a taxi. There was a long queue, bt it was perfect organised and there were lots of taxis coming, so waiting time was only about 15 minutes.",,
,,Amazing what flowers can do!,5,,"An amazing place, the dome is a treasure trove of flowers. Well marked and landscaped. A must visit.weekends can be very crowded.",,
,,Great place to explore,4,,"Beautifully created place with man-made waterfall and sooo many types of flowers under one roof (or two!) Though it could be disappointing to actually have to wait to queue for the elevator (yes,it could get really crowded during weekend),but the wait was worth it ! You can spend 2-3hours here maximum for both observatories.Cool place for a weekend getaway !",,
,,Great place to visit,4,,We visited both day and night such an amazing experience and we where lucky to be here to enjoy the National Day celebrations.,,
,,Manmade beauty,5,,This is a must visit place... This place is paradise located next to marina reservoir. Must see is cloud forest,,
,,Brilliant!,5,,We were recommended to the Gardens and it definitely didn鈥檛 disappoint. It is worth paying the entry for both domes - they are worth the $28pp. The plants & flowers are stunning as are the various displays and waterfalls. Although we didn鈥檛 do the skywalk it would be on our list to do next time we visit. We were there for 2hrs but think 3-4 would be ideal. Definitely go!!,,
,,Big,4,,"Have not been here since it was open. It seems like every tourist that visit Singapore will spend some time here. It鈥檚 really crowded, especially during the National Day. There are clear signage to guide you around. Even with its size, you can always find a quiet corner to sit down and enjoy the garden.",,
,,Amazing visit place,5,,"Visited the Gardens Festival and was amazed by the exhibitions. There were several exhibitions with different themes that kept me very busy inside and boomed my camera.

Cloud Forest is another must visit place in Gardens by the Bay. The mist show, skywalk, and waterfall will sure make your eyes open wide. All the art works are just simply amazing!",,
,,Beautiful Gardens by the Bay,5,,"The gardens have gorgeous forest like plants, waterfalls and amazing flowers and colors. The futuristic trees and the decks provide a fantastic view of the gardens and Singapore.",,
,,Singapore stopover,5,,"We caught the hop on hop off bus to Marina Bay Sands. The gardens by the bay are excellent. There is so much to see.
The time and effort that has gone into the gardens is amazing, it would be lovely if Australia could have an attraction like this.",,
,,Must visit. Beautiful and awesome place to be,5,,"When i first entered the place, i felt like having a aroma therapy. Such a beautiful place full of variety of flowers. My daughter was so happy to visit that place. Such a nice indoor garden.
Its a must visit place. should not avoid it thinking that its only a garden.",,
,,Wow!,5,,The cloud dome is amazing - be brave on the sky walk. It is worth getting to the light show early to get a good spot by the queue for the walk way to see the light up trees as some don鈥檛 have all the effects. An emotion voking show.,,
,,Very beautiful,5,,Beautiful gardens outdoors where you can take a walk and enjoy. At 19.45h there is a light show at the metalic trees which is pretty neat. I bought the ticket to go to the cloud forest and the flower dome and I really enjoy it. It's very worth!,,
,,A must stop for all Singapore guests,4,,"A perfect escape from the heat, a super pleasant walk around trees and flowers. As we visited the place afternoon, we managed to see the night light show. Didn't impress much, but its a matter of taste, I guess.
Plan minimum 2 hours for a visit + 2 hours round trip from Airport. so if you have 4+ hours before next flight, you can make it. Do enjoy the walk, the surrounding are nice. Dont take the $3 shuttle - simply not worth it.
After the Gardens we headed to Marina Bay - its in walkng distance and a great spot to complete the city tour.",,
,,Beautiful big garden in the City,5,,"We need at least half a day here. The indoor domes are amazing. Lots of beautiful flowers from others countries, and there is a beautiful man made water falls. The air is very fresh inside the dome. Outside the gardens are also very nice, especially in the evening when lights are up and dancing on the artificial giant trees. Look also for an open space hawker stalls selling delicious local foods. A highly recommended place to visit for everyone.",,
,,Singapore Icon,5,,This was a return visit after a few years. The gardens have grown and look lush and inviting. The Flower Dome again was themed - Orchids. Crowds and lines are now an inevitable result of the gardens success and peak as the cool of the late afternoon and evening. No visitor to Singapore should miss this iconic attraction.,,
,,Top attraction but allow time,4,,Gardens by the bay is a great way to spend a day in Singapore. There are many types of gardens that you can walk through at no cost and the cacti garden is a wonderful new addition. As many functions are held in the gardens your visit can be interrupted when they are being set up. The Supertrees are amazing and are covered with thousands of bromeliads and orchids. The walkway through the top of the trees can be closed during the frequent storms so check the weather. The two domes have admission charges but are well worth visiting and both have different concepts. The flower dome has displays from different parts of the world and the main display changes frequently while different blooms are in season. The Baobab trees come from most continents and are a feature. The Cloud dome is rainforest plants and orchids and the walkway goes up many levels. Most areas of the gardens and domes are wheelchair friendly. Take an umbrella.,,
,,"Lovely gardens, but not what I expected",4,,"I thought the gardens were going to be botanical like, but they were not as expansive, although I did enjoy them and particularly the orchids which were on show. Good to see, but not the highlight I expected",,
,,My favorite thing in Singapore!,5,,"I loved my trip to Gardens by the Bay. It鈥檚 so pretty and there鈥檚 plenty to look at. Look out for the wild otters, and make sure you go for food in the area at the back behind the childrens鈥?splash Pad. Stay for the free super tree light show at night too!",,
,,Singapore Gardens by the Bay,3,,Great attraction only if you have seen all of the Singapore attractions or there is special promotion for this rather costly visit to domes with air conditioned greenhouse.,,
,,The must do experience in Singapore,5,,"This is the must see and do experience in Singapore. Truly a delight to get around the gardens and the domes. It鈥檚 an absolute must to get tickets for the domes before getting there and, as with most attractions, the earlier you arrive the more comfortable the visit. I鈥檝e now been a few times and each time I鈥檓 blown away with how much the vegetation has grown and now it鈥檚 looking very settled. This whole effort is a real testament to the Singaporean people as well the team who maintain and prepare the environment. Given the volume of visitors it is very well kept and a beautiful series of gardens.

I鈥檝e been to plenty of zoos and botanical gardens (even the beautiful ones in Singapore), but this would have to be the best experience of a truly global presentation of flora anywhere. Absolutely amazing.",,
,,Great experience,5,,Our family visited and we really liked thos place especially the domes and the kids wet play area (take swimming stuff and towels of with young kids).,,
,,Very special place,5,,"Fardend are very doecusl place including the canopy walls and the forest cloud. Its s nice walk for couple if hours. Avoid weekends, its overcrowded .",,
,,Absolutely wonderful,5,,"This was the highlight of my trip. Truly spectacular. The waterfall was incredible, you could easily get lost here for half a day.",,
,,Stunning site at night,4,,Loved the light show. Very popular so very busy. If going later in the day head to the cloud gardens first. We watched the light show but were then too late to enter the indoor gardens,,
,,Amazing must see attraction and stay for light show,5,,"We were blown away and especially loved the Cloud Forest dome. Was quite magical to see it whilst they were misting (arrived between 3-4pm).
We hired a stroller for our newly turned 3 yo, they were quite strict on the weight limit of 15kg for it and pulled out some scales to weigh him. Note: their scales are wrong as they weighed him at 14.8kg, when he is only 13kg (we checked once we got home as we were surprised to think he may have grown so much rapidly)
We stayed for the light show and found a spot to lie down underneath one of the trees in the Supergrove around 7pm, to ensure a good spot. Awesome light show.
Long taxi queue afterwards but they have staff to assist and the wait wasn鈥檛 too long, less than 10min.",,
,,Awesome Depiction of Creation....!!!!,5,,"This is a place everyone MUST see., it is Simply Amazing. You get to commune with Nature and we (Humans) were supposed to live. Not in the ratpacked cities that we live in...!!!!",,
,,Spectacular,5,,Took blue line Hop on Hop off bus to this amazing gardens and buildings which have had millions of dollars spent as a draw card to tourists.There are varying levels and types of plants even staged to reflect plants from numerous countries all around the world.Truly a spectacular place and A MUST see when in Singapore.,,
,,A must see destination in Singapore,4,,You must visit gardens by the bay! especially the super tree grove and the skywalk. Go in the evening and see the light show on the super trees. There are food places and toilets and it is wheelchair accessible...though maybe not the skyway though there is a lift up to it.,,
,,Outstanding Gardens,5,,"It was a delightful experience visiting the beautifully presented, maintained and well looked after gardens. The experience will be remembered for a long-long time.",,
,,Spectacular Garden,5,,This is a spectacularly beautiful garden. The gardens offer the flower dome and the cloud forest dome and both are sights to behold. The night show was quite nice. The unique design makes it a must-see attraction in Singapore.,,
,,Never gets tired!,5,,"Our 4th visit to Singapore and as always we set aside time for a nice long walk around the gardens. Such a great free attraction, so good to walk amongst the trees looking at Marina Bay Sands and the super trees! Even better if you come to one of the nightly lights shows!",,
,,Much more than typical flower gardens,5,,"We spent 5 hours in the gardens including the two conservatories and the light and sound show, but wished having started earlier because we felt time passed vey fast. The Flower Dome is an absolute must, and the Cloud Forest is spectacular (btw, surprised how fast the queue for the lift was, considering the crowd on a Saturday afternoon). I have no words to describe the supertrees nite show. You got to see that. And we will have to return because the OCBC Skyway was closed due to lightning risk!",,
,,Sunny day in this gorgeous place!,4,,"We have a lovely time especially in the Cloud Forest! Although it was a blistering hot day we found refreshments (a tad pricey) and there were plenty of shady areas too. Would definitely return one day, this time probably earlier in the day to enjoy cooler temperatures.",,
,,Absolutely incredible,5,,"Get the tube to Bayfront and then it鈥檚 a very short walk following signs to gardens by the bay. When I was there a lovely lady gave me a map of the whole area which was great!

Followed signs to supertree grove where the super trees are which is obviously amazing to see, $8 to do the tree top walk which is definitely worth it. In busy periods you are restricted to 15 mins on the walk but this is enough!

Then I found reduced price tickets online via Headout website for the domes - $23 instead of $29 I think at the ticket office. This means only less than 拢13 for both of them which is absolutely worth it. I was blown away. Definitely definitely make sure you go to these - spent around 50 mins in flower dome and about 1hr 30 in the cloud forest. Cloud forest very informative and pretty moving stuff about climate change and protecting our planet.

Must see for Singapore!",,
,,"Amazing, but very busy",4,,"We had heard so much about this place and we were not disappointed. The whole concept is fantastic and well done.
We particularly enjoyed the Cloud Forest and orchids.

The light show over Super Tree Grove is spectacular with the city backdrop.

Be prepared for crowds",,
,,Great area to cycle around - great tracks!,5,,"Been going there for sometime now, always cycling there. Night views across a bridge is spectacular - especially on the opposite side. Am told that it鈥檚 the east side to look across. It鈥檚 beautiful!",,
,,Truly spectacular,5,,"Went through the flower dome to see the Orchid Extravaganza which was so beautifully done with an amazing number of different orchids well worth the visit.
I then went back to see the light show on what I call the Avatar trees and as it was Singapore's nation day later in the week the show was all about their national pride. It was wonderful
This was my first night time visit to the gardens and it was well worth visitint .... going again next week",,
,,Stunning flora and design,5,,"I visited Conservatories Gardens by the Bay while on my trip to Singapore and it was, undoubtedly, the highlight of my trip to the city.

The surrounding garden are quite amazing and you may think that the flower dome and the cloud forest dome may not surprise you, but you will be mistaken.

The flower garden is divided into regions and although most regions are beautiful, the orchid garden is breathtaking. Hundreds of varieties, with its beautiful colours and sizes. After that, the Cloud Forest manages to surprise you once again. I, nevertheless, you are in contact with more stunning unique plants in a perfect imitation of the real setting. The  cloud mountain with its waterfall does add to the atmosphere and the views from the top, and each of the themes -the cavern, the lost world, etc., especially during the mist time- are just magnificent. 

You certainly won't get bored and can spend hours in both gardens, but if in a rush, make sure you have a good hour for each one. The price is so justified for the quality and quantity that it makes, many other visits to gardens overpriced.

If you visit Singapore and love plants and vegetation, the conservatories are a must. If you are not crazy about plants, give it a try, the design and the unique vegetation may awake some love for vegetation after all.",,
,,Lovely evening,4,,Beautiful gardens all free to walk around. Lots to see could easily spend the whole evening there. Didn鈥檛 try food outlets,,
,,Beautiful gardens,5,,"Either by day or by night this is a beautiful tranquil place to wander and enjoy the flowers and pretty pools. We walked the gardens at night and enjoyed the ""trees"" lighting up during the light show. Once this was over it was like a scene from the Avatar film. It is definitely a must see during your stay in Singapore",,
,,Beautiful and relaxing,5,,There is many different type of flower Advise to go in the morning or afternoon Dun go at night as you can鈥檛 see any flower Is aircon so bring jacket if needed,,
,,Great family outing,4,,Well worth the visit. A must in Singapore! The night show was amazing! Kids really enjoyed it. No food available inside gardens though so take a few snacks for kids.,,
,,what a place !!,5,,"amazing piece of architecture , the gardens by the bay is a massive complex and truly very well maintained in all the terms.
it is for everyone to enjoy ( adults, kids, the elderly).
amazing variety of flora and fauna can be found.
don't miss the light and sound show in the evening .",,
,,Great way to spent half a day,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is free to visit and a fantastic way to spend half a day. There is a variety of different themed gardens to walk through and an excellent playground and water play area for children, so remember to take swimmers and a towel. There are two seperate indoor domes which house excellent display gardens which are worth the admission price to see, especially the cloud forest. Food options range from popular fast food chain stores, typical attraction fast food and local food hawkers. Would recommend starting a visit mid afternoon and staying for the evening light and sound show which occurs at 8pm and repeated at 9pm. Various tour operators go to the gardens, but the cheapest option is to walk to the gardens from the Bayfront MRT station. Well worth a visit for the spectacle, even if you鈥檙e not really a garden person.",,
,,Fantastic,5,,Lovely strolling around this area. Also the domes were really worth the look. Especially the cloud forest one. The range of plants was awesome. Although both great.,,
,,Very nice,4,,"It was incredibly busy, but the place is amazing. Maybe it was because we decided to visit it in the middle of the summer season. If you want to see really cool plants and architecture, you should go, but if you expect to do it calm and relaxed, this is not the place, everyone seemed to be rushed without enjoying the place just taking photos and running to the next spot.",,
,,Fantastic,5,,"This place was one of highlights of our Singapore trip.
There鈥檚 simply so much to see and do you may need to plan at least one full day, but ideally 2 days.
The domes get busy so arrive early to do those and the super tree walkway before crowds arrive. Then you can enjoy the other areas at leisure.",,
,,green singalore,5,,"gardens by the bay is an amazing experience,whethere its day or night....must visit..u can see exotic plants , flowers and cactus and u cant blv that in such harsh conditons we have a lovley garden...created and sustained too.",,
,,Different every time,5,,"This was my third visit since the Gardens have opened and every time i visit, the flower done is different. My first visit was near Easter and the flower dome was filled with Easter bunnies and Easter eggs. This time the theme was the garden festival with a Pernakan architecture feel with masses of orchids in every possible colour.

The domes are both attractions on the Singapore Explorer Pass. on 2 occasions I have walked across the lobby of the MBS Hotel and roadway to enter the gardens. It is well signposted.

The plants in the Cloud Dome have grown and were more colourful than I previously have seen. Walking down from the waterfall provides great photo opportunities both inside and outside.

On previous visits, there has been little train to take you around the rest of the Gardens to see the sculptures. I always liked this. Perhaps it was not operating due to the Garden Festival? We did catch the train from the MBS walkway to the dome area.

The trees have certainly grown from its inception- you could see this very clearly from the Singapore Flyer and the MBS Skyparks.

Always worth a visit.",,
,,Amazing detail,5,,Well worth the time and cost to visit. So much detail and points of interest. Great photo opportunities as well.,,
,,Good,3,,"Very long queue to enter the domes. However, the staff are very helpful and the crowd was manged well. Despite the long queue, the queue was quite fast.",,
,,Fantastic gardens,5,,This is the place to see when you are in Singapore. The gardens are just perfection. You really cannot fault them at all. The light display at night is fantastic. Don鈥檛 miss seeing it. Enjoy.,,
,,Beautiful Park,5,,"Beautiful park, over crowded flower domes. Certain tourist who have no common sense. People who are so anxious to take a picture that they can't wait till you are done. They will invade your space for their shot and ruin yours.

Great views and beautiful garden worth a see.",,
,,Visit to Cloud Forest,4,,"Very good attraction and my guests all love the Cloud Forest dome. It鈥檚 always an enjoyable trip, especially for young kids.",,
,,Amazing collection!,5,,Those who are interested in plants (and even technology) would be amazed at this unique collection of plants and flowers in two huge air-conditioned domes! Here are flowers I've never seen before in my life.,,
,,Wonderful,5,,"Visit in the evening when they have the light show. It was so fantastic, I can't describe the feeling. So many people laying on floor (best way to watch the show) to see the show of the trees and the well choosen music makes it perfect. If you are in Singapore, it is a must have activity.",,
,,Must see for everyone visiting,5,,"Have visited this on a number of occasions, very spectacular with a beautiful setting near the Sandes Hotel.",,
,,Do not miss this,5,,Absolutely wonderful place to spend some time. Beautiful plants and flowers and lots of interesting information too. Highly recommended.,,
,,"Free to wander, though the exhibits themselves are interesting but not cheap to enter",4,,"Free to wander, though the exhibits themselves are each interesting but not cheap to enter. The relatively high price was maintained even though one of the domes was under refurbishment. Deciding what to see, i.e. which domes to enter, was made more difficult due to domes having been renamed and their descriptions not being consistent. There was also a total lack of garden plans (maps) in English, throughout the gardens unless you had gone first to the customer central information point for some reason and asked for a copy.",,
,,Brilliant,5,,I so munched enjoyed the gardens well worth the visit especially at night to as they put a light show on.,,
,,Simply stunning,5,,"They say you can see both domes in 90 minutes. We spent 90- mins in the Cloud Forest dome alone (which was our favourite). A superb combination of clever architecture, excellent education and amazing plants.",,
,,fantastic experience,5,,I am not really a garden person - meaning I would not normally go out of my way to visit a garden on vacation but this place is unbelievable - I highly recommend it,,
,,Superb display of plants and excellent views from above,4,,Very interesting display of orchids plants and a very good view of marina sands hotel when you walk on the elevated skywalk. Very worth doing.,,
,,AMAZING,5,,"This space almost transport's you to the future, its great to visit a space that combines nature and constructions, all cities should have places like this. If you are in Singapore you MUST go to gardens by the bay",,
,,Day and night visit,5,,"My husband and I visited during the day then continued around the bay for the first evening showing of the light show on the bay. We returned on the evening around 9.30 to find a completely different atmosphere. Music and lights and lots of people. Both experiences were lovely in different ways. We did the sky walk during the day as it was much quieter and we could take our time. Cost of the sky walk was $8 pp. walking 1 way straight across the bridge. 15 mins. Then your guided off if your not already gone. Rest of the park is very beautiful allow plenty time to saunter in the heat.
Lovely experience. Not to be missed",,
,,Cooling glass dome visit at Gardens by the Bay,4,,"In the hot day of Singapore, visiting the cooling glass domes at Gardens by the Bay is truly a great enjoyment. The bright blue sky, beautiful, countless varieties of plants, trees, flowers and the cool air ! Great for photo taking ! I took so many of them. The paths in the glass domes are well designed. One can slowly walking and admiring the colorful flowers & sceneries, and not obstructing those who are rushing - very spacious ! The domes are well connected. So one may casually walking from one to another without experience the scotching sun ! If you love the hot summer weather, no issue. Once you step out of the glass dome, there are plenty of outdoor plants, trees and flowers for you to enjoy further ! Oh, if you like to try the driverless ride, there's opportunity for you to experience it here too! I took it, it is fun. The vehicle actually slow down when the crowds approaching. You will enjoy your day at Gardens by the Bay. It is a very family friendly place. Therefore, feel free to bring your young ones along. I had my lunch there with my family - delicious, many variety of food choices and the price was reasonable.",,
,,A Must See Attraction,5,,"Singapore鈥檚 latest pride attraction was captivating. Rose from the land-filled area across the city鈥檚 skyline, this magnificent creation promotes architectural designs focusing on nature and technology. It was worth a visit for educational purposes and entertainment with decent fee. Picturesque gardens, so bring a camera. It closes during thunderstorms, then reopens afterwards. A must see. It will never disappoint. Just check the weather and go.",,
,,Hugely impressive,5,,Well worth a half day in any Singapore itinerary. The two conservatories are so different; one spellbinding and the other simply beautiful. The hefty entrance fee is well worth paying,,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,"Buying tickets on arrival was easy and quick. To see everything, you have to have an early start.. We went in the afternoon and comfortably managed the cloud forest and the flower garden. The waterfall in the cloud forest was stunning. The plants were out of this world throughout the tour. There were many places to rest along the way. Safe area for children to walk and run about (under supervision of course). There was a McDonald's with good seating areas. The whole garden was simply spectacular.",,
,,beautiful gardens and visit in the day,5,,These are beautiful gardens. buy the tickets online to save time. its much better to visit in the day.,,
,,Garden by the Bay,5,,Very scenic for photo shoots. Be prepared to walk around the different themes within the park. Day and night views are worth taking.,,
,,Art and architect marvel,5,,"It's a superb combination of Art and architecture with immense planning and deDeication to the idea. Beautifully built,well maintained, awesome identity of the country. One must not miss this attraction",,
,,Very beautiful,5,,"Nice tourism destination, the garden was very beautiful. But it was so crowded. So many tourists there.",,
,,normal visit,5,,"had planned to catch Garden Festive, unfortunately missed it. Still very lots of fun for the kids (one 7 and one reaching 3).",,
,,Wonderful package with garden show,5,,Just stumbeled into this place and took the combo with the garden show. Quite pricy but worth it as we spent the entire day at this wonderful place and learnt a lot about SEA gardening and flowers...,,
,,"Take as long, or as little time as you like - it's still great!",5,,"Travelling with teens I wasn't sure how long they could handle a visit to the Gardens and I was pleasantly surprised with their level of interest. It was midday when we arrived and we were happy to enter the cool Flower Dome first. We travelled through it faster than most who seemed to enjoy their strolling pace. We paused at all the things of interest that caught my teens' attention and there was plenty of conversation around various installations.

Next was the Cloud Forest and I noted from a sign that the misting occurred every couple of hours (10am, 12noon, 2pm etc) and I mentioned to my teens it would be in 45 minutes from our arrival, but they said we wouldn't see it - happy to report we were on our way out, but certainly not at the exit when the misting came on and they were suitably impressed and stayed for an extra few minutes to watch the process.

Then it was off to the Supertree Grove where we got tickets to go on the aerial walkway which again suitably impressed with the giant 'trees' and the views. Although we took everything at a faster pace than many others, I felt that we had a perfectly timed visit for our teens who were really engaged the whole time and still talking about the Gardens at the end of our visit to Singapore. We came back at night for the music and light show which was simply spectacular. A must do.",,
,,A totally WOW place,5,,Awesome!! So awesome that we visited Gardens by the Bay twice in two days. The sound and light event was fantastic with Pavarotti playing in the background. Visited the waterfall/forest done too. Quite an experience. All so well maintained. It was indeed a pleasure,,
,,Awesome visit,5,,Great location to visit in the late afternoon. The light show is fantastic. The only regret is that there are so many visitors that you have to wait a while to access certain place.,,
,,!!!,5,,"You cannot miss this place once you are in Singapore. Absolutely MUST! It looks a bit pricy, but it really worth))) Try to avoid weekends especially evening, too many people moving to the exit after the light show at the same time))),",,
,,Garden by the bay,4,,"Visited recently in month of July, though in this month usually weather in Singapore is hot n humid but no tension as you get admission in the garden there are two Air-conditioned domes one flower dome another rainforest.... really amazing experience, we amused by garden maintenance n irrigation system...so must watch list in Singapore itenary.",,
,,Exquisite,4,,"Every city has something special about it. Singapore has many ""somethings"" to its credit. With all the stuff that they're already famous for, they created one more. The gardens by the bay! A set of man made trees with a concrete core and metal scaffolding that allows for the growth of thick foliage that mimics real trees. The beauty of the idea is amazing . But the nights when sun sets come alive with the glimmering sound and light that mesmerises you. All the trees are lit up to the pulsating music and the aerial walkway connecting the trees make the whole experience just superb. Young and old sit there drinking in the sight of the musical lights. Enjoy it lying down so that you get to see all of it without a crick in the neck.
And then you have the indoor flower dome and the cloud forest . A green house like textured gardens and forest that includes a waterfall. Flowers and plants of different parts of the world find a place here and the profusion of colourful flowers makes the experience ethereal. interspersed with the beautiful flowers are some driftwood sculptures that captivate you.
Make sure to get there early and after completion of the flowers and forest, you can enjoy the sound and light show
TIP:Get there early to get some vantage points.
A restaurant on the top of one of the trees is a luxury if you have time to sip a cuppa seeing Singapore from a vantage point. A buds eye view as it were of downtown and MBS area.",,
,,Great visit for a late afternoon evening,5,,"Great place to program an afternoon away. Children and teenagers will love it, so much to do and to explore. It is nice to be there at sunset, also Pollen the restaurant inside the Dome is worth a visit",,

,,Gardens by the Bay - sightseeing,4,,"The best periods to visit Gardens by the Bay are when there are large outdoor events, musical festival and concerts such as Laneway Festival and Christmas Wonderland. An enchanting transformation experience from the day to night.

,,Gardens by the bay family trip,5,,"When going to gardens by the bay, you definitely cannot miss out on the domes if you are a first timer,there are so many wonderful flowers in there and even a waterfall in one of them. I can guarantee that you won't regret visiting the domes if you are a fan of flora and fauna. However even if you don't visit the domes, there are still other wonderful places to visit in gardens by the bay.",,

It鈥檚 like nothing else I have seen or been to with my family and we have been fortunate to travel a fair bit.

,,Singapore Garden Festival 2018,4,,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Garden Festival, with the lovely and imaginative displays and the amazing exhibits. A wonderful and refreshing experience.

It was disappointing though to not have the option of a Garden Festival ticket only and not have the pairing with one or both of the domes to pay for. The Garden Festival itself was very extensive and then to feel we had to visit a dome, because we had paid for it was quite taxing, especially for older people. And also we weren't able to linger at either the festival or the flower dome as we would have wanted too, if we were only doing one thing.",,
,,Jenny Duff,5,,Highly recommend a tour of this as a must when visiting Singapore. Absolutely beautiful. Cool inside so may need a cardigan.,,
,,Sundate at Gardens by the Bay's Flower Dome and Landscape exhibition,5,,"Hi, guys. This is Singapore. It's and humid. Please do not be turned off. It's fun to take the buggy around Gardens by the Bay and have a leisurely walk inside the Flower Dome(fully airconed using the Solar system). There's a fantastic Michelin star restaurant there, too. It's called the Pollen. You may want to experience this when you're in Singapore. Cheers",,

,,Fresh and invigorating,5,,"I am amazed that you can barely find a wilted, brown leaf or a drooping flower among the thousands and thousands which are exhibited at the Gardens. The view of Marina Bay Sands and the Marina are also extremely refreshing making you feel like you are outdoors while still being able to enjoy the coolness of air conditioning. Pollen is a lovely restaurant to stop for a coffee as well.",,
,,Phenomenal,5,,Such an amazing place to go and meet nature! The gardens are fascinating and you can learn a lot from them. Absolute must see.,,

,,Singapore Flower Festival,5,,We attended the Singapore Flower Festival at Gardens by the Bay during July 2018. The displays were fantastic as well as the Gardens area.

,,Truly A City in a Garden,5,,"Love the sprawling nature park. A marvel of a creation on acres of reclaimed land.
The garden reinforces our city's reputation as a Garden City.
Love the supertrees and am amazed that they are powered by solar cells. So very impressive structures
I enjoy the lush greenery and the regular exhibitions of floral display.
I particularly love the cooled conservatory, Flower Dome and to walk amongst the thousands of plants and flowers from different countries.
A hundred percent worthwhile visit for visitors and even locals. Good for walking and strolling around this huge colourful and futuristic garden.
Also lots of eating places when one is exhausted!",,
,,Mesmerizing Experience,5,,We are regular visitor. The Flower Dome is worth to visit also the Light and Sound show is mesmerizing.,,
,,Some of the best gardens in the world,5,,"I planned my trip so I was here for the two yearly garden festival so got the bonus of 14,000 orchids in the flower dome as well as the competition displays in the rest of the gardens and various workshops. Consequently I spent 11 hours here and got to see the light show as well. The whole thing was amazing and I would repeat it when next in Singapore. If you are just visiting the gardens I would suggest doing it in two stages and coming later in the day for the flower dome and cloud forest so you can see the light show as well. I actually came to the light show three times as my hotel was very near the downtown line and only four stops away. It is massive and easy to get lost finding your way to and from Bayfront station in the dark but all part of the experience. I ended up in Marina Bay Sands one time and got to see their light show on the water as well.",,
,,Family outings,5,,"Garden by the bay is an outstanding garden with many many beautiful species of flowers. These flowers are arranged in such a way that beautify the surrounding. Most of the flowers are from temperate countries that is why the surrounding is enclosed with the tempeture of around 20 degrees Celsius especially in the day time where outside tempeture is around 30 degrees Celsius.
In the evening the atmosphere is more beautiful with lightings.
Visiting Garden by the bay with family members are a wonderful experience.",,
,,A delightful trip for Solo,5,,"Went to Flower dome, as part of the Singapore Garden Festival displays were there.
Spent 2 hours only (not enof) as i need to pick up my children from school. Though short, had a blast! Can never get enough of flowers, so delightful at God's creation. You have to be there to experience the sheer joy flowers could bring. It's a healing time too :) - wife",,
,,Tickets are too expensive !,3,,"First time visit to Garden for the Flower show. The location is not anywhere 'By the Bay' and is a fair walk from the mrt station.

The Orchids on display was nice and a great variety. However, the flower dome is not a really big place so spending an hour there taking photos is good enough. Can't say much about the other type of flowers... the Kangaroos paw was quite ordinary and the Hydrangeas a disappointment. Nothing much unusual.
Moreover, the ticket price is too expensive, considering that you can also see a great variety of Orchids for free at the nurseries or Orchid farms. The only difference is that flowers at the Gardens are nicely arranged for photo taking and is in an air-cond place, away from the hot sun.
The Cloud forest requires a separate ticket but it only has a man-made waterfall.",,
,,Flower dome n cloud forest at the gardens by the bay singapore,5,,Singapore is hot n so gbtb is our favourite family outing. Especially flower dome where you can see different display of flowers at each time of visit. Lovely display n we can take beautiful photos with the flowers. So plentiful n well arranged. The chairs in there are huge and comfortable. Always feel relaxed and happy after visiting the 2 aircon domes.,,
,,What an experience!!,5,,Went to Singapore to see the sights and especially the Gardens by the bay. What a place. My wife is an orchid fanatic and by chance we visited during the orchid festival and competition. She was in her element. BUT the crowds were awful. All food venues except Maccas were full and we had to sit on a hard stone bench for 90 mins to see the light show that was worth it. Glad we did it and were blown away by all the flowers.,,

,,A visit with the family,5,,"It鈥檚 not often my Son, Daughter in law and grandchildren visit us here in Singapore, but when they do Gardens by the Bay is a regular place to go.
The 鈥渇ree鈥?to enter evening light show is always a pleasure to watch and the accompanying music good on the ears.
I must admit in 2017 when it was more British pop that was played was better, but it is still very good now in 2018.
The show is twice nightly, 7 days a week and always attracts lots of visitors, not tourists and locals.
You can follow it up with a walk around the marina, taking in the impressive skyline of Singapore鈥檚 business district, where there is a multitude of buildings, many above 40 or 50 floors high, all lit up in an array of colour and styles.",,

,,Must visit when you are in Singapore,5,,"Garden by the Bay, although man-made is a place you must not miss when you visit Singapore.

,,Putting their money where their mouth is.,5,,"Singapore has aspirations to be a City in a Garden and if you take the time to visit Gardens by the Bay you will immediately see that this is not one of those fuzzy goals that politicians love so much. Check out the Skyrisegreenery project on the web for evidence that Singapore is well on the way to being a biophilic city and these gardens are an outstanding example of the progress that has been made. The Flower Dome, the Cloud Forest, the Super tree grove and the many smaller but equally impressive gardens are worth a visit. You will leave wondering why the folks who run your city haven't made similar things happen.",,
,,Light show,5,,What a most enchanting place both during the day and during the evening light show. Well worth a visit.,,
,,Fabulous - don't let the flowers put you off!,5,,"I must admit I wasn't really hopeful of a fantastic experience more just looking forward to being somewhere cool (in the temperature sense).

,,Good and fun! 2 stars because of the locker is a money eater,1,,"Overall great experience because the staff there were nice. But please be careful when using the locker as there is no refund and there is also a countdown for you to put the notes in.

Worse of all, the machine cost about $4 SGD but if you only have $10 note with you, good luck because the machine doesn't find you change! However you could still go to the visitor's center to change for small notes. I'm a singapore and this locker is a crap",,
,,Brilliant,5,,"This is a must visit if you come to Singapore, a bit reluctant at first as I am not into flowers but this is much much more then just flowers and gardening, the 2 domes are worth the entry fee purely for what they have achieved. At night the whole place takes on a different personality with the laser show.
We could not climb the trees as the wait was 1.5 hours to get up there, so be prepared for large crowds at night. Highly recommended",,
,,Spectacular,5,,This is definitely the most extraordinary place to go to..If you have been before go again as it changes all the time. What an achievement. And the waterfall is so beautiful. Just walking slowly down to the bottom..The Orchards are exquisite. Enjoy.,,
,,Don't go when its sunny!,3,,"Okay so we did the walk but was it worth the wait in the line with no shade while the sun is beating down on you, probably not. With some cloud cover may have been a better experience but too hot to be out there. Perhaps best to go at night but the lines are probably much longer at that time?",,
,,A tree light evening,4,,"Nice evening here. Great place to take young kids and have water fun and playground activities. After watch the tree lights. One tip, bring some kind of blanket to sit on. :)",,
,,Fresh flowery Aroma everywhere,5,,"Must go place in Singapore. I am a Singaporean myself and every time I have overseas friends, this place is a must go/must bring for them. When visiting the forest dome, it really feels like you are near a natural waterfall and flower dome, crisp fragrance of many flowers whiff through your nose.",,
,,Just amazing,5,,"Loved every minute. Take comfortable shoes as you are in for a lot of walking if planning to stay the whole day/night. Started the day early with the Cloud Dome then the Flower Dome both breathtaking. Walked down to Satay by the Bay for a lovely lunch. Walked the outdoor gardens, into the domes again then waited by the trees for the night light and music show. Get there early as there is not much space cause it gets packed out very early. Would thoroughly recommend to all",,
,,Amazing Inddor Gardens,5,,"Highly Recommended. Been here for the 4th time & still enjoying it. This time, it was Singapore Garden Festival",,
,,10 out of 10 Tourist Attraction - Something for every age group,5,,"Gardens by the Bay can be visited at any time of the day. I would recommend going late afternoon though so you can see them during the day time & at night time which is just mesmerising. At 8pm (this time may change) they have a spectacular light show to opera music/singing - just spine chilling - not to be missed.
A must see tourist attraction",,
,,Exploring Green Nature,5,,They have lots of plants. You can feel that your in a jungle. Loving the air and weather inside the doom. Even its only with air conditioned but you can feel your like in the jungle. 馃槉,,
,,Gardens By The Bay - World Vegetation In A Dome,5,,The Gardens By The Bay must be seen to be believed. The plants are arranged according to continents and are magnificently presented. You can take as long as you wish and the tram ride through the gardens is also well worthwhile.,,
,,Great views,4,,"My family and I cycled from East Coast Park to Gardens by the bay and we loved the scenic views at Gardens by the bay :) There's a wide variety of beautiful flowers that makes the place so colourful and vibrant! Also, there's the OCBC skybridge that allows one to have a bird's view of the scenery (with charges of a few dollars) and also 2-3 domes where each has a specific theme and filled with beautiful flowers (paid entry)",,
,,Day out to the Gardens by the Bay,5,,Garden by the bay consisted of two dooms and it is air conditioned. It is a beautiful place and consisting unique plants from the world over and is neatly crafted and zone according to the places where the plants comes from. Night comes would be better as dazzling lights comes to life. This is the reason for air conditioning the doom.It is really worth a visit,,
,,Spectacular,5,,"This is certainly one of the most spectacular places I have ever visited. The variety of plants, the neat application of technology and the sheer size is just amazing.",,
,,BEAUTIFUL,5,,This place was absolutely beautiful. I went during the day time and night time. They have a light show that takes place at night. It is absolutely beautiful. This is a must see place. Great for all ages. It is a lot of walking. The place was a lot bigger than I imagined.,,
,,Flower Dome@ Gardens by the Bay,4,,The theme of the garden changes regularly. The orchids exhibit was the highlight when I visited. The air-con environment provided a respite from the heat and humidity. And the garden has a lovely fragrance! The photography there is certainly instagram worthy!,,
,,Better then expected,5,,I was not sure if I wanted to do this but I was pleasantly surprised. The gardens are free and they are large and you can easily while away a couple of hours. You can find plenty of shade and cool down in one of the attractions. A bit touristy and consider a night time visit for the lights.,,
,,Worth a isit!,5,,"The garden is always changing landscape and you never gets bored or tired visiting again and again. There is so much space to move around and even though it may be crowded, you can still admire the flowers, the plants and take photos without any photo-bomb. The cooling air around the plants is so pleasant.",,
,,Lovely gardens,5,,"We loved the gardens by the bay during the day as well as the night. The musical trees were a big hit, we went to see it twice. Our toddler loved it too. And two domes near the gardens were amazing too. We happened to be there during their tulip festival which was absolutely amazing. I don't think I have ever seen anything like it. And the permanent exhibition in the other dome with plants, flowers and water fall was also amazing. Definitely worth the visit.
The second time we also had chicken satay by the bay. It was a bit of a walk from the musical trees to find it (especially with the toddler) but it was a nice experience and we enjoyed the food.",,
,,Stunning,5,,"Went there for 3 hours, stayed for 8. There's just too much to see. If you only have time to check out one place: this is it.",,
,,Orchid garden,1,,Visited orchid garden recently at Gardens by the Bay. I know orchids can be a bit boring unless you have beautiful patterns or designs to display the orchids. Singapore flower is the Orchid however Gardens has not managed to bring out the attractive ness of the Orchids. The Tulips and roses theme in previous years were better. Just a feedback so that Gardens can make Singapore more proud in displaying your dear Orchids. Maybe you need to mix Orchids with more roses and lilies and other sweet smelling flowers too. Display was too repetitive with peranakan theme. Good luck for next year Orchid display,,
,,Spectacular,5,,"Visited the gardens in the evening and saw the light show, which was spectacular. The show I saw started @8pm for about 15 minutes, classical music is also played which really make the lights more dramatic. The structure within the gardens that light up are made from some kind of metal but all the plants that are entwined within the structures are all real. Definitely a place to visit. I went on a guided tour so couldn't spend lots of time there. There are food places so if you spend longer you won't go hungry.",,
,,Underwhelming after the botanical garden,3,,"It might have helped to have nice weather, but after spending a couple hours at the gorgeous botanical garden and not wanting to pony up the expensive entrance fee for the domes, there wasn't much to see beyond the supertree grove.
Had some good food at a decent price at the Satay by the Bay centre in the park.",,
,,"Enjoyable visit, good way to see some amazing gardens",4,,"Take some good walking shoes with you, there is plenty to see in this place, interesting and colourful",,
,,An amazing variety of the world's gardens,5,,The shear scale of the domes and the high quality of the garden displays make this a much see attraction when in Singapore.,,
,,Loved it!,5,,I鈥檓 not a gardening person & wasn鈥檛 sure it would be worth the admission price for a party of 5 adults but was wrong -well worth the admission price to the two domes. Loved both of them & then watched the amazing light show in the super tree garden with the opera music - spectacular!! Highly recommend this Singapore attraction.,,
,,We loved gardens by the bay at night,5,,"This had an amazing music and light show at night , we loved it , it is very humid here though so take plenty of water",,
,,Spectacular,4,,"Came here with our extended family and was extremely impressed.

It is not cheap to go to the flower dome or the cloud forest, and you have to pay more still if you want to climb the supertrees, but you can't fail to be impressed by the sheer size of the structures. Definitely one of the highlights of our Singapore trip.",,
,,Must visit when in Singapore,5,,"Brilliant!!! Wear your walking shoes and allow plenty of time. Superbly done, plants, flowers, carvings, sculptures- all brilliant. Fantastic and not expensive. Well done Singapore.",,
,,Eye Opener,5,,"An absolutely amazing and jaw dropping experience. From the moment you walk in , you don't know where to look first. The two domes and the interiors are amazing with the waterfalls and the skywalk, the colours and atmosphere. Wespent around 5 hours in total and could have stayed longer",,
,,Wow,5,,Wow you can not go to Singapore and not visit gardens by the bay. It is amazing! The beautiful light show is magical.,,
,,So amazing 馃槈,5,,Walking around was so nice looking at the gardens and water falls and going up and up And staying until night time as there is a night show where the tress light up and they play music 馃幎 very nice and relaxing 馃槍,,
,,Beautiful,5,,"What a place! This $1bn garden is outstanding!! The domes are great, one is all about flowers and one represents the rainforest. The metal trees and high walk are awesome. Well worth a visit",,
,,Fantastic!,5,,This is truely a fantastic place. We went to the indoor dome with the waterfall. We also saw the lightshow in the evening. We unfortunatly had a bit limited time. Will come back another time in Singapore to use some more time here.,,
,,#1 Favourite tourist attraction to take visitors in Singapore,5,,"The super gardens of Singapore!

Having resided in SG for a couple of years, this is my most favourite touristy spot to take visitors.

The domes it self I have only been in once, and its quite pricey, but worth doing at least once.

Favourite thing is the light show at night, been there 1/2 dozen times, every time it's a different experience, different music and slightly different show! Make sure you got a few minuntes early and get a seat on the ground or under a tree to take in the show and ambience and go WOOOOOOOOOWWW and awwwwwww.......",,
,,OMG!,5,,"There really are so many words to describe Gardens by Bay .. Stunning, Beautiful, Fabulous, a credit to Singapore..
We spent just about a whole day here, walking around and soaking it all in. The two glass domes are just spectacular. A lot of thought has gone into this and it has paid off. The inside and outside gardens, waterfalls, wet play park and even the cafes are just awesome. You can not go to Singapore and not visit Gardens By the Bay. The night time light show is so worth going back for, just make sure you get there early as the seating goes fast. The tickets were reasonably priced, it was extremely clean and easy to find your way around.",,
,,Two hours walking in the green,4,,I liked Gardens by the bay. Special attractions are the super threes. Many plants and flowers and a magnificent view of the Flyer and the Marina Bay Sands.,,
,,Beautiful but packed,4,,"The gardens at the bay are beautiful, and I recommend seeing it if you're visiting Singapore.

The Skywalk between the mushroom like trees can be accessed by paying for a ticket, but the queue to get up was over 2 hours as there's only one elevator.. shame, because I'd really want to see it from the skywalk.",,
,,Wow,5,,"Amazing, Great just to walk around and free to get in but I would recommend using the skywalk and visiting the 2 domes which are not free.. If you are pushed for time the cloud forest dome is the one to visit. Twice every night the Supertrees are lit up by a 15 minute light show also free. There is also a bar and restaurant at the top of one of the supertrees which opens in the evening, as with everything in Singapore it is expensive but the view of the city is superb",,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,"This is one of the best I ever visited. Anyone goes to Singapore should visit this. You will see how hard Singapore has made this happen. It is purely due to their commitment, dedication, strong vision and speacially the discipline that Singaporeans have inculcated within them.",,
,,UNIQUE COLLECTION OF FLOWERS,5,,"It was a nice experience, starting from the tram-ride, touring the Garden and getting charmed with the different types of cultivated flowers. It took more than 4 hours to tour, but it seemed that the longer would be better.",,
,,It鈥檚 big,5,,"I recommend you go there after 6pm because during daytime there鈥檚 no light and heat is unbearable. Knows where u want to go and go in and out, it is big so tough with kids that鈥檚 too old for stroller and too lazy to walk...
Touristy place, buses and buses dropping off peoples.
I will come back in near future to fully explore Singapore.",,
,,Amazing!,5,,If you have only time to do 1 or 2 things in Singapore then consider this place. It is a fantastic world-class facility. Well worth the entrance fee.,,
,,Beautiful!,5,,I absolutely loved the Gardens by the bay! It was amazing and beautiful. My favourite part is the cloud forest dome but the entire garden is worth seeing. It was my favourite part of the trip.,,
,,Lovely afternoon,5,,"Wandered around for a few hours. Visited both dimes and then walked through the gardens generally. Walked across the sky bridge.

Whole thing is very easy to get to on the metro system.

Similar to the Eden project in Cornwall.

Beautiful flowers, easy to access and walk around.

Definitely worth a visit.",,
,,Must visit!,5,,It鈥檚 a very good place to hang around during late evenings and night. The view is just breathtaking. Highly recommended.,,
,,Fantastic day out,5,,"This place is huge. The two air-conditioned ""domes"" have amazing flowers and gardens - I loved the orchids and the waterfall. You have to pay to enter the domes, but the outside gardens are free. Everything is so immaculately clean and well-maintained, and great to walk around, even in the hot, humid Singapore weather.",,
,,Great way to spend an afternoon,5,,We thoroughly enjoyed Gardens by the Bay. It鈥檚 quite expensive to visit the special exhibitions and the sky walkway so we only did the Cloud Forest but it was well worth it. The indoor waterfall was very cool! Also learnt quite a lot about conservation. Great place to take children.,,
,,Nature in a modern city,5,,"Gardens by the will give us an experience of entering the forest while we are still in the city, we enjoyed ""Flower Dome"" and ""Cloud Forest"" where we enjoyed the green forest and even an artificial water falls.
We went in the morning untill mid-day, it is quiet challenging of the weather, yet we can see the city view better, some people suggest if we like to enjoy the lights then we go in the afternoon untill sunset so that we can see the lights of Singapore.
It is like a gigantic green-house of the garden with a breezing air inside and giving artificial experience of entering forest in its best way.
Unfortunately, I can not give some instant picts here.",,
,,Nice garden,4,,You can literally spent a day here for photos shooting and walk around the garden. The entrance to the garden is free however if you want to enter to the dome you have to pay for an entrance fees.,,
,,Very Busy!,3,,"Worth going to it is interesting but very busy and probably only worth going at night for the lights show, if you can leave early to escape the crowds but is very pretty!",,
,,Excellent - best attraction of Singapore,5,,"When you talk of Gardens lot of plants and trees planted in a organised fashion comes to mind, but these gardens are well planned man made gardens with artificial huge trees that are connected to each other through a walkway at some places. Very nice place and photos here would be too good. A paradise for Selfie lovers...",,
,,Marina Bay Gardens,5,,"We had seen photos of the special treats Marina Bay had to offer but nothing beats being there first hand to experience this human endeavour. What a delight it was to see the 'trees' at Marina Bay begin to light up as the light of the day faded. People grew in numbers as this spectacular vision lit up brightly, colours changing and different sets of lights shone over the area. Not to be missed if you are in Singapore.",,
,,Spectacular,5,,"What a fantastic event, light show starts at 745pm very crowded, arrive early, well worth the wait. Gardens beautiful loved the orchid displays.",,
,,Must see,5,,"Gardens By The Bay is a must see in Singapore. As with everything in Singapore it is beautifully laid out and incredibly well maintained. We went during the day so its important that you bring hats, sunblock and water to drink as the temperatures can get very hot in the afternoon (we were in Singapore for 10 days in July and never once used an umbrella - it only rained once in the middle of the night). The Cloud Forest is a must. Incredible structure and amazing display of tropical plants. The Flower Dome is really a museum of orchids so a must for any flower gardener. You can collect an easy map of the gardens at the entry point. Singapore is an amazing city and this is one of the highlights.",,
,,Artificial but beautiful!,4,,"A mix of artificial trees and beautiful tropical nature. If you鈥檙e touristing through Singapore, that鈥檚 a nice walk to take in the evening.",,
,,Man made beauty,5,,The park is huge and beautiful. Almost everything there cost money. The light show from the tree shaped structures was beautiful and free. A must go if in Singapore.,,
,,Cloud Forest is the best,5,,"Gardens by the bay is very beautiful. You really need to have a full energy going there considering the the walks you need to go around the area. But all your tiredness will wipe away once you enter cloud forest.

Tip: Buy tickets from Klook and don't go on a sunday. Plan your trip and consider the weather in going there. Morning til 3pm could be so hot to walk around.",,
,,Impressive,5,,"No better ways to start the visit of Singapore by this architecturally unique garden, with artificial trees and children's garden. To be done by day and by night.",,
,,One of the highlights of Singapore,5,,Great location with lots to see and do. The best bits are the giant trees and the cloud dome. If you go to the light show you can continue to walk to the marina bay illuminations shortly afterwards.,,
,,Great to have a Calm Spending,5,,"This place comprises of various gardens, Supertree Groove, Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome. Wandering around Supertree Groove and various gardens are free of charge. But, you have to buy tickets for the sky walk at Supertree Groove, Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. You should allocate about 6 hours to leisurely cover the area.",,
,,beautiful stunning place,5,,"This is a must visit for any visitor to Singapore, Such a beautiful interesting place. See the highest interior waterfall and walk along the platforms.",,
,,Must see,5,,Definitely a must see in Singapore. Very crowded at times so try for a midweek visit. Garden itself is free just have to pay for domes and skywalk If that鈥檚 your thing. Obviously it comes alive at night.,,
,,Fascinating !,4,,A must visit if spending some time in Singapore. The light show at 7.45pm was free and was worth waiting for.,,
,,Mrs Jamie Shaw,5,,I was fascinated and love the Singapore Garden Festival . Was disappointing that we couldn't get into the floral arrangements as there was professional photographers in there and it was hours. very sad to have traveled so far and not able to view all the displays . surely this could have been done at another time before the show opened,,
,,Enjoyable day out,4,,I visited the gardens on a hot July morning & enjoyed both the Flowerdome & the Cloud Forest. They are a lovely escape from the glitz of the shopping malls & you could easily spend a day enjoying the displays & stopping for lunch. The surrounding gardens are particularly peaceful with lots of secrets to discover around every corner. There is a shuttle to transfer you to the train but I preferred walking through the gardens & stopping along the way.,,
,,Amazing,5,,Worth the money and a very nice experience. Beautiful flowers and views. Nice at the evening with all the lights.,,
,,Loved it,5,,Loved Gardens by the Bay. We got tickets to the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome and didn't regret it - they were amazing. The super trees light show was a relaxing diversion. Loved the opera music with it.,,
,,Beautiful garden and worth a visit!,4,,"The garden is interesting and so beautiful and it is worth to take a visit if you are into plants and flowers. We also paid the ticket to go to the skyway (and its not so necessary worth it), but it was OK.",,
,,Don鈥檛 miss the eve free show!,5,,"Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay Sands, Singapore flyer and Merlion statue- all lie very close to each other and can be covered together....
It is a must do attraction in Singapore with beautiful huge trees which look amazing in night! You can visit the Gardens for free and enjoy the evening show which is a treat to the eyes. Just grab a place below the trees and enjoy the sound and light show. There are two shows- one at 7.30pm and next at 8.45 I guess..pls confirm the same on website...
There鈥檚 a ticket for the skywalk, i.e., a bridge made between two trees. Worth as you can take a view of the huge gardens from the up and click pics with beautiful tree views or Marina bay in backgrnd....
One of the trees has a restaurant at the top, so you can go there and order a drink or two and enjoy the view.
There are two domes with tickets as well- Cloud and Flowers. We did the cloud dome as recommended by all, it had a beautiful waterfall and you can go at the top with a lift and again enjoy the views, click pics inside with beautiful flower props.
Overall a great experience! Loved it :)",,
,,Gardens by the bay is the most tourists destination in Singapore. 馃憤馃憤馃憤馃憤馃憤,5,,"We visited on last Dec 2017 during Christmas season. Decoration is awesome, we love the christmas atmosphere at here especially at Flower Dome. It was an spectacular sight to behold. Cloud forest and supertree groove are fantastic. We enjoy the light and musical attraction at supertree grove in the night. It's cool experience. It's a must visited place once come to Singapore.",,
,,Amazing,5,,"We should have planned a bit more time for this attraction. Definitely visit the Flowedome during the day, then go see the cloud forest when its getting dark. The light show ""Garden Rhapsody"" at the Supertree Grove is absolutely amazing and a must do when in Singapore. You can watch it daily at 7.45pm and 8.45pm.
There is also a light show at Marina Bay Sands at 8pm so it is doable to see that one first and then see the Garden Rhapsody at 8:45pm as there is a direct way (connecting bridge) from Marina Bay Sands Hotel to Gardens By The Bay (just follow the signs!). If you travel with Singapore Airlines this attraction is included in your SSH.",,
,,Not to be missed!,5,,"Breathtaking both day and night, and unlike anything we鈥檇 ever seen, these gardens are awe-inspiring. Don鈥檛 miss the either of the atriums, offering two totally different experiences, and both are AIR-CONDITIONED! It鈥檚 an excellent way to beat the heat of the day, but be sure to come back at night for their Supertree light show. So unexpected, and so beautiful, also not to be missed!",,
,,One of the modern Marvels,5,,"Amazed to see the dedication of this country, so well managed a forest in middle of the economy epitome of bustling Singapore",,
,,Beautiful Views!!,5,,"The gardens by the bay was incredible. A free visit unless you wanted to go on top, which was justifiable in terms of cost. Great views of the water from above. But being in the gardens (nighttime especially) and seeing all the greenery was incredible. Definitely worth a visit when visiting Singapore.",,
,,Spectacular sight to experience,5,,"Great for the whole family. A must to see at Marina Bay!
Go early morning or late afternoon! Midday is too hot.
A botanical experience to enjoy. Put aside a few hours and enjoy the outside and inner venues based on tropical plants and atmospheres.
When finished head to the shopping mall nearby!",,
,,Impressive,4,,"Very well made, worth a visit! Good lighting, acoustics slightly neglected. Architecture around is astonishing and beyond what modern architecture normally offers.",,
,,Spectacular and truly beautiful,5,,"I am well travelled and seen many light/music shows etc but these gardens and the light/music show is just truly something out of this world.

We visited Gardens by the Bay as a family of 10 people, we went at approx 4pm. No queue for tickets to get into the two domes, and a relatively easy process. They recommend that you wait to by the sky walk passes once you are down there as they can close the skywalk dependant on weather conditions.

We opted for the flower dome first which had an orchid festival on. The orchids were amazing and so pretty and beautiful - patterns and colours that I have never seen before. This dome is split into gardens from all over the world and their native flowers and trees. After, we completed the cloud dome and again this was amazing. We were in the dome for the misting and that is fantastic for picture opportunities. The museum at the end of the cloud dome is eye opening - it describes all of the damage that we are doing to earth and the predictions that professionals are making - I highly recommend watching the short movie clip 鈥?5 degrees鈥?
Both domes took us around 3 hours but you could easily spend more or less time depending on how much time you want to spend in them. After the domes we headed to the skywalk also where the music and light show takes place.

Now in hindsight and what I would recommend doing is being down there as early as possible unless you want to do the skywalk in the evening. We done the skywalk around 730pm, which by this point it was dark. However the show begins at 745pm and they recommend that you are down underneath the trees lying down to look up and watch the show under the 鈥榮tars鈥? We started queuing for the skywalk at around 630 so we waited in the queue for approx 1hour, completed the skywalk and were back down for the show to begin. The recommended time up in the skywalk is only 15mins and you have stewards that move you along if you are spending too much time up there.

The show itself is amazing, especially when you know that the entire gardens/domes/show is self sufficient and runs on solar power and collected water (for misting). The show is highly recommended and I cant stress this enough, it is truly magnificent and something you have to experience yourself to truly appreciate the beauty of it.",,
,,should revisit!,5,,"I guess, I should revisit here since I came here following a group and it seems that I have not seen everything.",,
,,Beautiful & kid friendly,5,,"We had a wonderful time in the gardens during a short trip to Singapore.

We timed the trip for the afternoon, playing in the free gardens first, then viewing the two paid exhibits (flower dome and cloud garden). We then ate at the outdoor eating area and by that time it was getting dark. That allowed us to see the light and music show in the main gardens which was just beautiful.

Our kids particularly loved seeing the fish in the large lake and the otters in the river.

We aren鈥檛 massive orchid fans so perhaps we could have missed the flower dome but the listing in the cloud garden was unmissable.",,
,,Garden Festival,4,,Good disppkay of flowers and enjoable. Took lots of pictures as memories. Will visit again next year but hope to see exotic flowers,,
,,Impressed,5,,What a great way to spend an afternoon.Such an amazing well done job.The two domed gardens are a must see,,
,,Too crowded,2,,The walkways at the basement of Flower Dome were extremely crowded. The Forest Cloud dome had a long line of people waiting to take the lift up. I won鈥檛 want to go again in the near future.,,
,,A Must See In Singapore,4,,Would highly recommend going to Gardens By the Bay. Beautiful display of vertical plants and the skywalk provides a bird's eye view of the area. I encourage you to call before going. When we arrived we were disappointed the learn that the Cloud and Flower Domes were both closed for maintenance. I'm certain that if the domes had been open this rating would have been 5 stars. The Supertrees provide a spectacular light show in the evening.,,
,,Very nice but very very crowded,3,,"The gardens themselves are lovely, the unfortunate thing was we were in Singapore on a short turnaround in the middle of summer holidays. It was Absolutly packed you just stood in queues everywhere trying to dodge people taking 鈥渟elfies鈥?by the thousand. What they do with all the selfies is anybody鈥檚 guess but take them they will. The kids splash zone is good for a cool off though for the little ones. Price is ok but it鈥檚 not really value for
Money as you get swept along by the huge throng of people and can鈥檛 stop to fully appreciate it.
Glad we have been but won鈥檛 be going back
(unless it鈥檚 off season and empty)",,
,,Amazing Outdoor Space,5,,"This is a must for anyone to visit but especially those with kids they want to run around and burn off energy! In the heart of a bussling city this is a short walk, metro stop or at the very least cheap cab ride away from most downtown hotels. You can do so much for free but be prepared to queue for entry up to the Super Treetop Walk if you go on a weekend (small admission charge). We went just before dusk and great to witness the changing colours and sunset over Marina Bay Sands.",,
,,Best ever: Amazing,5,,"I went to Singapore by myself primarily because I wanted to see the Super Trees when they were lit up. The show was outstanding, breathtaking, along with the lovely musical selections. I was completely entralled with the presentation. Just gorgeous!!",,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,"A must see for the light shoe - adults and children. Been twice, and not disappointed either time. Simply beautiful - and it's free!",,
,,Gardens by the bay,5,,This was really cool to see even if you not into gardening type stuff..lots to see..good to go on a hot day as the place is cool inside. Go see the other attractions close by,,
,,Breatht,5,,We weren鈥檛 prepared for the sheer scale of the place. The indoor gardens are spectacular. We could have taken 2 days to see it all properly. There was just so much fabulous stuff to see!,,
,,Crowded but still nice,4,,"We arrived precisely 10 minutes before the 7:45 light show and the main square near the super trees, where the show takes place, was packed. People both sitting and standing in the area made it uncomfortable to walk. However we did manage to find a spot and the show was amazing! We also had the chance to visit the flower dome where thousands of different species of plants are grown to make for a delightful exhibit! This is a must if you visit Singapore!",,
,,A nature-oriented theme park,4,,"This is a must do for your out-of-town guests on a short visit to Singapore. A bit artificial, but unique, sensational and quite pleasant.",,
,,Breathtakingly Beautiful,5,,The gardens are beautiful and a place which you can enjoy for free. It is a really relaxing place where the scenery is amazing. I recommend spending around 2 hours walking around the gardens and across the river where you can take photos of the Singapore Flyer.,,
,,Absolutely amazing displays,5,,"We visited the gardens on a Monday in order to avoid the very crowded weekends and happily spent 6 hours exploring. The displays were absolutely amazing, especially in the 2 domes (Cloud Dome and Flower Dome). Plant and flower displays are divided into regions/climates, with regular glade rest areas and easily accessible paths. We visited during the orchid festival, which provided so many colourful displays. Many interesting sculptures appear throughout and the elevated, multi-storeyed walkway in the Cloud Dome make the experience even more interesting. The Super Tree Grove and elevated walkway (which lights up during the night) provides spectacular views across the park and towards the Marina Sands Hotel. We also recommend the Singapore Garden Society displays including the Lost Garden. Crowd numbers increase as dusk approaches and especially on weekends. Access from Bayfront MRT station is a convenient way to visit. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and would highly recommend a visit if in Singapore.",,
,,Out of this world,5,,"What a beautiful place to be, what an imagination before building this place both the domes are just amazing",,
,,Over the top,4,,"The gardens, especially the cloud forest, are really over the top but worth a visit nonetheless. Book tickets on line and you can buy them for $23 instead of $32",,
,,must visit flower dome,4,,"I have been to the flower dome multiple times, and every time it amazes me! I think this is a must go attraction!",,
,,You will love it,4,,"Gardens by the Bay is definitely worth a visit. You should plan to spend a whole day there. The entrance is located close to the Marina by the Sands complex area.

The outdoor garden area is free admission. It is open from 5am to 2pm daily. This gives you access to the Sun Pavilion, Supertree Grove, Heritage gardens, dragonfly and kingfisher lakes and the World of Plants.

There is also the Cloud Forest dome and the Flower Dome within the Gardens by the Bay complex. Admission to these is Singapore Dollar 28 for adults and 15 for children aged 3 to 12 years of age. Singapore residents pay less (Adults 20 Singapore dollars for entry to both domes). The domes are open from 9am to 10pm. I have written separate reviews about these domes.

There are separate Indian and Chinese gardens within the Gardens by the Bay.
Each and every aspect of the Gardens by the Bay is beauty personified. The flowers are colourful and beautiful.

The Supertree Grove is simply amazing. It is out of this world. At night there is a light show that has to be seen to be believed. The light show is accompanied by music - and the colour changes are light fantastic.

If you don't feel like walking - there are buggy rides with audio commentary.

There are cafes/restaurants - but the prices tend to be on the high side.

There is an additional charge if you go on the OCBC skyway. This takes you up to the tree top level of the Supertree Grove. Prices are 8 Singapore Dollars for adults and 5 Singapore Dollars for children aged 3 to 12 (April 2018).

I enjoyed every minute of my visit.",,
,,An amazing Place in the Middle of the City,5,,"If one is interested in nature, a visit of the Gardens by the Bay is absolutely amazing and very educational. Don't miss the Cloud Forest!",,
,,Garden By The Bay Festival 2018,4,,"The plants and flower festival is still interesting except on Sat & Sun, there will be an influx of people at the Food Marketplace as compared to weekdays.

,,Gardens by the Bay & Garden Festival,5,,"If you go to Singapore you simply have to go to the Gardens by the Bay! They are absolutely beautiful architecturally and environmentally. Also, if you are lucky enough to be in Singapore when the Garden Festival is on you should definitely attend, the free concerts and exhibitions are well worth seeing and we could鈥檝e spent days looking. Make an effort to go back at night to see the super trees lit up as well, although the Cloud Dome and Flower Dome are much better during the day.",,
,,Nice if you love taking close up of flowers,4,,The flower garden is Great if you like to take close up of flowers. Otherwise it鈥檚 not as interesting as we thought. The cloud forest is not bad. Both are worth a visit if you鈥檝e never been.,,
,,Fabulous Attraction,5,,I went not knowing much about the Gardens by the Bay and was greatly impressed by this attraction. Make sure you allow plenty of time to discover these fantastic gardens and all they have to offer. Make sure you do the treetop walk it is a must!,,
,,Must See,5,,"Gardens by the bay is a must see while in Singapore. You can get there many ways, we went on the SMRT, the gardens are a short walk from the station. This time we went later in the day so we could visit the amazing flower Dome which had a special feature for Singapore garden time. By the time we had viewed the beautiful flowers and had a short wait it was dark and time for the music and light performance from the Super Tree Grove, was all truly amazing.",,
,,the wow gardens of singapore,5,,"you will need a full day at least, into the night, follow every path there is so much to see. everything is perfect and full on. and so so clean like all of singapore . a world class event",,
,,Worth visiting,4,,It feels good to be among so many well kept flowers and plants. I consider getting a whole year visiting pass to the two greenhouses.,,
,,A must on any visit,5,,"Massive project and a must for any visit, two massive 鈥渄omes鈥?vast gardens an the iconic trees mean this is a must. Can be a full day , but also spectacular music and light show in the evenings.",,
,,Fabulous attraction,5,,Could have spent days here as they're so much to see. Very impressive. Loved the night time light show.,,
,,Exquisite and unique garden systems,5,,"This is a must see on any visit to Singapore. Even if you decide not to pay for the greenhouses (which you should not miss) the fabulous sculptures are extraordinary and a free light show each night is an added bonus.
Departure at the end of the show is a heavy rush but the taxi lines move reasonably quick",,
,,Into the Future,5,,A must for every visitor. You get the feeling you jumped into the future....its just fantastic. Mikedelgr,,
,,Fantastic gardens,5,,"A fantastic garden.
If you have tickets to visit both domes please check in advance that they will be open.
One closes one day, the other another day ( I think this must happen every week for maintenance as they are so well looked after) we didn鈥檛 know this and visited on our last day.
They offered us a free admission the following day to the other dome - but as we were flying out we couldn鈥檛 take them up.
That being said there鈥檚 plenty to see",,
,,Highlight of our trip! Worth a visit for sure.,5,,The Gardens by the Bay are magical and a must to visit when in Singapore. The flower dome and cloud walk are wonderful to explore. The Orchids in the flower dome were so colourful and vibrant.,,
,,Surreal. A dream.,5,,"This is a must. Stay for the light show, sit and enjoy. I felt like I was transported to another world! What a treat.",,
,,Gardens By The Bay.,5,,Absolutely sensational. We spent all day wandering around these beautiful gardens. So much to see and I鈥檓 sure we still didn鈥檛 see all there was to see. A must do in Singapore.,,
,,Interesting!,5,,Visited with my 12 year old son. Loved all the beautiful plants and flowers! Thankfully a little cooler than outside.,,
,,So beautiful !!,5,,"Worth going and also there are 2 play me I鈥檓 yours pianos next to each other
Lots of places to eat.
We left 5 mins before the show finished so we didn鈥檛 have to wait long for a taxi
The show was amazing , so was the sky walk",,
,,Bought the cheap ticket package from 11street.my and worth every cent,5,,"The place is good for family, just the walking part will be a burden for old people. So just pay for the shuttle bas and they will skip the walking part. Loves the light show during night time, be sure you get a good spot. The show will be starting from 7.45pm and 8. 15pm.

If possible, visit flower dome before 5pm and slowly walk and you still can see all flower is blossom. After 5pm, you may head to the forest dome and soon late night, the lights is up and you can have a different view for it. And the best part is they have mist spray out as well. You can definitely experience the feeling in high mountain.",,
,,Dream from hell,5,,"From hell of Singapore weather and traffic I come to the dream of fresh, cold, full of oxigene envinromental of Cloud Forest and Flower Garden. What a engeenering and gardening achivemant - ! What a poetry of flowers, coulers, forms. Nature is a bigest engeneer.
Stop for a moment, look at carefuly and think about this.
We are very close to losing all of it",,
,,Cool Place,4,,Good place to visit and hide from the sun in the dome on hot day. Entrance fee applies for dome area.,,
,,Good,4,,"More signage needed, not enough binformation. We did not see everything, as we did not lnpw about all the exhibitions.",,
,,Great break,4,,"Great place to go for a break from shopping, with gardens, sculptures and walks.
Sound and light show at 7:45 & 8:45 pm was great. Suggest that you walk round the skyway through the big trees before the light show as the queues are quite long afterwards.",,
,,Garden by the bay,5,,A visit to dreamworld/paradise. We were on a half day tour i.e.about 6hrs but the time was insufficient. Enjoyed every moment.,,
,,A Stroll in the Park,5,,"We walked through the gardens for most of the morning. We didn't get any tickets for the things to do there but just walking around the views and the scenery are something else. Some spectacular designs and architecture, with endless amounts of green and fresh air. Highly recommend it, even if its just a stroll around.",,
,,Must visit place is the cloud forest and flower domes,4,,"The cloud forest is the true highlight for this place. Its absolutely amazing to see such a marvelous place built up and maintained in Singapore. Very very interesting, beautiful and must visit. The only thing they don't tell you is that ITS COLD. Carry a jacket to enjoy this place and plan 2-3 hours for a thouroghly interesting experience.",,
,,Need to know glass house environment,2,,"I went with my family before national day to gardens by the bay. The smell inside the glass house made me run out of it. Even the trees made you feel what you are looking in singapore, the real nature. I'm very much upset with the price they are charging for visit, when we can grow such plants at home.",,
,,Nice place to go around,4,,Nice view from Stands roof top. Pleasant place to re energize. New world to explore. Nice to see garden festivals happening.,,
,,Enjoyable and enriching experience,5,,"Gardens by the Bay houses various types of flora and fauna. These are places in two indoor areas as well as populated around the bay as well (which is open to public access). One can take their time to appreciate the plants on display and take wonderful pictures as well. Also, there are food joints around the area so you do not have to worry about have a meal during your visit, if you plan to spend an extended amount of time in this place.",,
,,Gardens visit in July,5,,"Gardens by the bay is well worth the effort. I was in Singapore 25 years ago and boy has the place changed.
They have done amazing things at the gardens and it is worth a look. You need at least half a day to see it properly and take the time to enjoy it.
The variety and broadness of the gardens is amazing. I loved the all the orchids in flower.
Well worth the effort.",,
,,馃寛Walking into the Blossoms Blooms 馃尭,4,,Fantastic Flower Blooms! Non-stop photography with Blossom!! That how I feel Gardening is such a wonderful job!! Well done Singapore Garden By The Bay & Singapore Garden Festival 2018. Regards from your Visitor: Yionn Wu OY 馃尫,,
,,Family visit to Gardens Festival,5,,Enjoyable trip. Volunteers were very helpful. Grandchildren loved the flowers. Overall it was an enjoyable and fun visit.,,
,,Magical,5,,Gardens by the Bay is a MUST visit when in Singapore! Truly AMAZING exhibits and overall message. Free admission with the exception of 2 exhibits and a trolley guided tour. You a can walk and enjoy at your own pace. They turn on the lights at night so check the schedule amd DON'T miss the times. Take your time and ENJOY your day as this is a multiple hour journey.,,
,,Mind blowing,5,,"I have been to many countries and cities around the world yet Gardens by the Bay took my breath away.

I definitely recommend a good 3-4 hours to spend there as I was quite limited with time and didn't get to see everything.

You must see the light show, so I suggest going in the afternoon and ending with the light show. I also suggest getting there 10-15 minutes before it starts to get a good view.

This is by far one of the best things I have seen and would love to go back to experience all of it.",,
,,Spectacular spectacular,5,,"Look, we had avoided Gardens by the Bay on previous visits because it鈥檚 a lot of walking/tramping around in hot, sticky weather.
I鈥檓 sooo glad we didn鈥檛 miss out on our most recent Singapore visit. It鈥檚 wonderful, spectacular, beautiful...every superlative imaginable.
As with everything in Singapore, it鈥檚 an easy MRT commute from wherever you are. Entry price is reasonable. You pay extra for the Cloud Forest ( don鈥檛 miss it ), and the Flower Dome ( begonias were the massed display and I鈥檓 not a begonia fan but could appreciate the work), but most spectacular were the Supertrees at sunset as they start to light up...just WOW!!! People come to lie on the ground, looking up as the colors change, and it鈥檚 spectacular!
Remember that scene from Baz鈥檚 Luhrmann鈥檚 Moulin Rouge, 鈥渟pectacular spectacular 鈥?.. this is the embodiment for me...
I was ashamed of my reluctance to get sweaty walking it as streams of locals went by on their evening jog!
Don鈥檛 miss it...
Reckon we鈥檒l go for an encore",,
,,Highly recommend,5,,"We thoroughly enjoyed this attraction, the domes are simply stunning and you can definitely lose yourself in the grounds for a whole day. The night show is certainly worth hanging around for too, loved every minute.",,
,,A letdown compared to previous installments. You have been warned.,2,,"The last time we visited, there were a myriad different species of flowers from many different countries, making it a very worthwhile visit due to the wide variety of beautiful flowers. However, this time round, they were mostly local variety of orchids being inserted into set pieces of balconies, interior spaces etc. If there is any wow factor in this, it鈥檒l be 鈥淲ow, have I wasted my time.鈥?You have been warned.",,
,,Simply amazing!,5,,"The nicest part of Singapore, worth to spend the whole day and evening! The night show is just incredible, I could watch it again and again!The best part of it that most part of this attraction is completely free of charge, just to enter the dome which I found less interesting you need to pay.",,
,,Crowded over an orchid show,4,,"Cray crowd last weekend when visiting . No way you can find a single parking in any carpark or nearby. Way too crowded with visitor and not worth a visit as the flower dome is quite small. The orchid show was great but very crowded and you can鈥檛 enjoy.. probably better during other day. The direction from MBS a bit confusing with no clear direction. The queue to enter WS badly managed as no one tell you where to start your queue . The surrounding of the flower dome is beautiful and you can enjoy a nice stroll to see heritage , Chinese and India garden.do enjoy..",,
,,Gardens by the bay,5,,"One of the most popular and highly visited place in Singapore. It's worth the time and money spent to visit this place. Music and lights show in the evening is mesmerizing. This is next to two artificially created domes, flower and rainforest domes which are equally good",,
,,"Tourist destination, but not much",4,,"This is a fascinating place to go. They have the Avatar trees, and it makes for good views. The gardens are interesting, and this is definitely a place to go.",,
,,Garden festival,3,,"Compare to two years back, the flower concept are more and nicer but arrangementfrom the management were good.",,
,,Perfect to beat SG鈥檚 humid weather in the Domes,5,,"The flower dome was cooling and perfect for Singapore鈥檚 humid weather. The flowers had a huge variety and it was family oriented. I went with friends and it was a perfect, clean indoor walk.",,
,,Impressive elements but cheesy,3,,The construction of the cloud forest and garden dome is very impressive. It鈥檚 unclear why so many cheesy elements are added. The natural wood sculptures fit in nicely.,,
,,Great place,5,,The gardens by the bay is a place not to miss when you are in Singapore. We especially enjoyed the rainforest area and the outside walking.,,
,,Breathtakingly Beautiful,5,,We visited Gardens by the Bay after a tiring afternoon at Marina Sands Skypark & Casino. The Gardens Rhapsody is a really breathtaking show. We didnt pay for the view from up as we saw that the people lied on the floor down the huge trees and saw the show. We were excited to do that and the excitement double when the played Chaiyaa Chaiyaa from Bollywood. Its a great place to relax and watch the show. You can choose if you would want to pay and watch the show from above.,,
,,Gardens - good times to go,5,,"Lovely place to visit and breathe. Most visitors seem to go late afternoon, early evening so they can stay for the Supertrees lighting up around 7.30pm. However it does get busy and noisy at this time so I suggest visiting the Domes early morning then coming back in the evening for the Supertrees. It is free to walk through the Supertree area ( you can pay to go on the Skywalk).
If you come in the evening you can then go to a rooftop bar for drinks or night views. The Skybar is in Tower 3 and although you pay to get in you can redeem the amount against drinks.
Also check the days the Domes close as some are closed on certain days.",,
,,Beautiful!!,5,,"Loved it here, so beautiful & clean. The supertrees are stunning & impressive, both at day & at night. Flower dome & cloud garden cost extra but not overpriced. Highly recommended.",,
,,Wonderful gardens,5,,It鈥檚 my third visit to the Gardens..and each time they have new plants and the pleasure is always there..The night show is wonderful..and the organization is perfect...I will hreatly recommend this visit,,
,,Magical especially at night,4,,Do the gardens by the day to see the extent of all the flower displays but also stay for the sunset concert that happens everyday. Queues to go up the metal tree walk can be long at dusk so be prepared to wait but the view from Marina Bay Sands across the river is possibly better.,,
,,"Amazing technologies, however...",3,,"Amazing technologies, however:- 1) No surau provided for Muslim visitors. 2) Hard to find dustbins to throw rubbish. 3) No variation of halal foods, only Texas Chicken. 3)",,
,,5 star if not for the crowds,4,,Great man made unique tourist attraction that didn't exist 10 years ago. Gardens are air conditioned and would be a great place to walk around with visitors or a date if not so crowded.,,
,,Better than the pictures,5,,We have been looking at pictures of Gardens by the Bay for years and when we finally got a chance to visit we were not disappointed! It is an inspiration for future gardening endeavours.,,
,,Perfect time for family.,5,,Perfect place to bring ur child to as he starts to see the beauty of nature. Ending it of with water park for the kids is definitely worth it.,,
,,A man made wonder,5,,"To all visitors to Singapore, this pace is a must see. The climate controlled interior is so pleasant and comfortable and the gardens with all their beautiful foliage and flowers are just simply incredible. Allow yourselves at least 6 hours or even a full day to do justice to this incredible place. Wandering around inside both structures in the comfortable coolness whilst enjoying the beauty that nature has to offer is an experience not to be missed. The cloud forest mountain complete with waterfall at first glance seems formidable, but in fact access to the top is easy via a lift located inside the mountain, then its a pleasant stroll via walkways and escalators back to the bottom.

I know of nothing in the world that comes close to this other than natural forests and jungles an absolute delight to behold. and then there are the giand steel frames trees WOW",,
,,Innovative display,5,,"There are gardens and then there is Gardens by the Bay. We spent nearly 5 hours roaming around, doing justice to these fantastic, creatively presented gardens. It was worth the $28 Singapore Dollar entry fee per person to visit the 2 domes, although the outside gardens areas including the Super Trees and the light show are free. One finds sculptures unexpected displays randomly which added to the delight. Strongly recommend a leisurely visit.",,
,,Perfect place for Nature lovers Artificially,3,,Got huge collection of flowers/trees from all over the world under one roof. But always crowded and not clear direction.,,
,,Lots to do at a great spot in Singapore,5,,"We attended the Flower Dome, Cloud Forest, and the Sky Walk. All were great for their own reasons. Lots to do here and you can spend hours. We came on a Singapore Airlines stopover deal which I would definitely recommend since most of your entry costs are covered. Beautiful views and a real spectacle. Definitely recommend checking out Gardens by the Bay when in Singapore.",,
,,Surreal & Mesmerizing,5,,Seeing Gardens by the Bay for the first time made me rapt in awe and wonder at human creations. The whole experience feels so surreal and mesmerising. I spent a couple of hours just lying down and watching the twinkling lights on the tree change and flicker. The amazing light show at 7:45pm and 8:45pm takes your breath away. Definitely a must visit .,,
,,"The light show is excellent, and the gardens themselves need to been seen in daylight",4,,"This is a must see in Singapore at night. There are effectively three things to see. The domes, the night show on the space age trees and the gardens themselves by daylight. This is not a botanic garden, but still ok. Brings swimmers for children as there is a wading pool area, plus it gets very hot due to all the concrete paths.",,
,,Beautiful and diverse!,5,,"There is much to see at Gardens by the Bay both by day and night. A drink at the top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel will make your eyes pop! The Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are completely unique. Make sure to walk across the OCBC Skyway at the Supertree Grove and stay to see it all at night. You'll run out of ""Wows""!",,
,,Great water playground.,4,,"If you are travelling with kids of any age, my daughter is 18, I recommend you find the children's play area. There is a great water playground. We were not prepared with bathers, but we still took off our shoes and got wet. Great way to escape the heat and rest a while. This is free, as was the other gardens around the cloud and skywalk",,
,,Woooowwwwww,5,,Like in the Avatar film! Reach the big trees at night and lying on the floor wait at 19:45 or 20:45 until lights surround you and Pavarotti voice will be proud to be Italian!!! A free show you really can't miss in Singapore!!!!,,
,,Stunning Supertrees,5,,"We were at Gardens By The Bay to attend the Singapore Garden Festival. What a spectacle it was! Superb displays both indoors and outdoors. Then, as the sun went down, we watched the Light and Sound Show at the Supertrees area. Fantastic! Set to classical music we were absolutely amazed with the display.",,
,,One of a kind,5,,One of the best tourist attraction in Singapore you should go first and see. You will be mesmerized all the live plants inside the dome . 馃憤,,
,,Big Greenhouses...full of flowers,4,,"Interesting place, huge glass houses with amazing large tree specimens, waterfalls and orchid displays. Very impressive worth a stroll on the way to the airport if you have an hour (its close).",,
,,Lessure,5,,Beautiful place to have a look. Enjoy each and every thing about the gardens. It's a nice place for a family outing with kids. Looking forward to visit again soon.,,
,,A testament to what is possible with enough cash,5,,"Stunning! The enormous, somehow climate controlled spaces of the flower and cloud forest areas are just amazing spectacles, manicured and looked after with all the efficiency you expect of Singapore. You don鈥檛 have to be a biologist to enjoy these, although I am, the waterfall is worth the entry alone. The super trees are an amazing space age sight with the walkway providing a stomach jerking walk.

Well, well worth your time! well done whoever designed this! Allegedly it鈥檚 all powered by biomass energy. Given the power all this must take that must be a lot of biomass.",,
,,Fantastic Concept,5,,we visited Gardens by bay during our visit to Singapore on 23 July 2018. This consists of Flower dome Cloud Forest and Super Tree Grove. The concept of of these structures it self is great. You need at least 3 to 4 hours to see and enjoy different flowers arranged in artistic way. Its a wonderful experience. The Cloud Forest is like a dream. Nothing like that may be available anywhere. For about an hour or so you will be in dreamland. Both these are a must visit for any one on visit to Singapore.,,
,,A magnicent work of men,5,,This place is really awesome especially the light show at night. A must place to visit in Singapore. You will be awed by the technology that men bestowed to main such magnificent place.,,
,,A must see!,5,,"The gardens are beautiful, spacious and the conservatories are the best air-conditioning in town! So good after walking around in the heat. Best go during the week as the weekend was so busy! We missed the light show but they have two every night 7.45pm and 8.45pm. easy to get to by MRT or a stone's throw away if staying at Marina Bay sands.",,
,,Best indoor gardens in the world,5,,"The gardens by the bay is a place not to miss when in Singapore. With a controlled temperature, flowers and plants from all over the world flourish in the garden.",,
,,World Class,5,,Time your visit - Monday morning was great. World class gardens which was a delight. Share the experience and take your time to enjoy. If you can - book Pollen Restaurant for lunch or dinner. Very memorable!,,
,,Very beautiful,5,,"The gardens are beautiful and well planned. Really worth a visit. The two domes are air conditoned and are a welcome break from the heat. They are very different so recommend looking at both. There are a number of people but unlike other attractions in Singapore - no lines. We enjoyed it. If you go at dusk, the lighting in the cloud dome is spectacular.",,
,,Incredible and unique tourist attraction,5,,"Amazing gardens from all over the world, great for families and people of all ages. Does take a number of hours to get through and is very busy but worth a visit",,
,,Explorers,5,,"This was magnificently design .. An indoor park /done , fully air conditioned .. It has several mini attractions like the skyway , dinner/ bar , other park .. We bought Cloud forest dome and and the Flower Park . I have 2 young Kids with me and since Singapore has a tropical weather .. my 2 kids always sweat and will complain that it is hot.. This place is paradise for Mom like me .. I get to enjoy the view and the flowers without the complains from being hot and sweaty . Clean facility that could even cater to able people . Very nice and mind blowing . Very creative as well . Highly recommended to all ages !!",,
,,Chill-out place,5,,"The ""Gardens by the Bay"" area is a great place to stroll around, chat, jog and enjoy the vegetation and the light summer breeze. A good time to come here is in the afternoon or evening after sunset, especially the ""Supertree Grove"", where huge artificial trees are the display for a fantastic lightshow with music. An event one must see once in Singapore.",,
,,Great place to visit!,4,,"Though the place has some distance from the MRT exit to the Flower and Cloud dome, it is a nice place to visit.
Try visit in the late evening hours will be a nicer choice with the lighting display and top view from the higher portion of the Cloud Dome.
It is an indoor style and cooling with lots of air condition.
The view of the waterfall design is nice and cool.
the cloud dome and flower dome both are side by side where the exits of the dome will lead to the same souvenir and gift shop location.

Try both domes when going to the venue. It is worth the visit to both as it is side by side.
The flower dome is filled with different types of flowers and orchids
Lots of visitors at the location too.
the walk around the cloud dome is nice too as can see from far away is the Singapore Flyer at a high view.
If hungry, there are venues for food options too",,
,,Nice view point,5,,"If you want spend your morning time in Singapore, you can visit here to check out the greens and flowers. They have a great garden and a nice view point of Marines Gaint wheel. And also we can observe skyscrapers near by the area.",,
,,Awesome gardens!,5,,"Don't miss this! The cloud forest is fantastic and the flower dome is very colorful with plants from all over the world. There is also a very good restaurant in the flower dome. Buy the combination ticket to see both gardens. Weather permitting, take the skybridge to view the park from above. The light show at 8 pm is very worth staying into the evening.",,
,,Great!,5,,"Great place to unwind and orchid lovers! A cool and splendid place to easilly spend few hours wondering around, the elevated walkways, the orchids and the waterfall.A lot to enjoy in an enclosed space away from the heat, nightime light show was quite spectacular. The hanging bridge connecting the trees was quite fun. Could use a little more food and beverage outlets tho but not a deal braker. A must go.place when you are in Singapore.",,
,,stunning,5,,We took in the gardens in the evening of out stop over and they are clean stunning and definitely worth a visit. The light show isn't bad either :),,
,,Such an Amazing Experience,5,,Gardens by the Bay s truly a MUST SEE. The bay is quiet large and has many things to see within it. The Cloud Forest is located within Gradens by the Bay and also I believe it was the Flower Dome. This is truly a breathtaking tourist attraction,,
,,Amazing place to see,5,,"An amazing place to visit. The fact that Singapore is hot, humid and gets a lot of rain allows for this unique place to exist in a major city. There is a charge to get into various parts of the park, but you can walk around for free. You can spend hours here. Very interesting. There is a MRT station at one on the entrances.",,
,,Serenity in the nature,4,,"Definitely worth visiting, it's picturisque and calm. You should visit the cloud done specially during their miating time. And the wood carvings in the flower done are mind blowing. Truely a sight to behold.",,
,,Man meets Nature for a perfect partnership,5,,"Marina Bay Gardens is one of the most beautiful attractions ( actually it wins the prize) in Singapore. I sort of still think the world class botanic gardens are the best attraction but Marina Bay is in a different class because Nature has been transformed by Man and clearly enjoys it. This mega wonderland has been created on the reclaimed land that the Marina Bay Sands monolith sits on. The hotel is joined to the Gardens by a zany footbridge which is inspired in its design by the mitochondrial helixes of a DNA molecule. Do not miss this! There are two huge natural ""houses"" which are themselves architectural masterpieces, house two separate biological/horticultural exhibitions to delight young and old. Nearby the amazing sculptured trees that are a masterpiece of colour at night and which attract thousands of dedicated followers to watch in wonder. When you're done woth things botanical follow the signs to the amazing satay house.",,
,,Cloud Forest was great,4,,A lovely way to spend the afternoon. It鈥檚 air conditioned so not hot like I expected in a greenhouse in Singapore in July! Well worth a trip,,
,,Too much hype,3,,"I prefer natural surroindings. These Gardens are too interested in techno and bling. We took the driverless car, which was fun, but found the food outlets poor and the layout confusing.",,
,,Great visit,5,,"Get MRT to the Bayfront - come out and turn right - its only a 10 minute walk and you are inside the park. If you want to pay and go inside the pavillions then you can get a golf cart ride to the pavillion entrances - walking under the trees and around the park is free

At about 7:45 they start the sound and light show - lasts about 20 minutes

Nice to arrive 30 minutes or more before hand to walk around the park

We opted, like many others, to lie down in the middle underneath the trees to see the lights",,
,,oasis in a densely populted city,5,,"It is a very pleasant experience walking among the large variety of lush green plants. The unique gigantic constructed tree columns are, of course, iconic images of modern Singapore.",,
,,Must visit,4,,"Gardens by the Bay according to me, the #1 place to visit in Singapore for tourist & residents. We live in Singapore & go there often. Have a chill-out evening, walk around or god for a run. Lots of restaurants, nice sea breeze and fantastic views. Read about the super trees and enjoy them. The 2 domes always have something new & exciting and one of them is like The Spheres in Seattle",,
,,Amazing place,5,,Absolutely worth seeing. Enjoyed getting out of the heat and walking the gardens. Did both dimes and it was totally worth it. Beautiful flowers and plants and like nothing I have seen before.,,
,,Amazing experience,5,,We enjoyed the flora and plants at this place Very enjoyable and great experience .... we like it a lot...,,
,,Average,3,,We visited the Super tree structures. It looks impressive from afar but not so great from near or from within. We went during the day. Apparently there is lighting in it at night,,
,,Lovely man made attraction,4,,"The light show where the electric trees light up is spectacular. Please note this is FREE! No need for a ticket for this. The ticket combo is for cloud forest which was quite nice and flower dome which was fair. You also get a combo with the skybridge included.

In all honesty the main attraction is the free light show with the electric trees and the other paid for attractions could be skipped if you have limited time. Also the electric trees lighted up is wonderful at night.",,
,,A MUST do!,4,,"This a definite visit if you are in Singapore, especially at night when it is all lit up! It can get very busy of an evening and the Q for the cabs can be very long so I'd pre book a cab for after",,
,,Jungle in the city,5,,"If you ever took a good walk in an average city park, you'll get an AMAZING walk in this 'park'! Just the supertrees and the Marina Bay Sands will remind you that you are in a city. The supertrees makes this place very futuristic, like if you're on another planet, but the flowers makes this place like a jungle...
Tip: Go there in the afternoon, walk around the places, visit the Flower Dome or the Cloud Forest (or both of them), and when the sun set, go up the OCBC Skyway. If the sun goes down, wait for the evening lights, it will be awesome!",,
,,Gardens by they bay,5,,Charming gardens beautifull . Species all world over in domes exposed like a museum that teaches all audiences,,
,,Perfect engagement proposal,5,,"The most magical place on earth. Do not miss out on seeing this amazing place, make sure you go during the day and watch the gardens come to life by night.
We were blown away by its beauty.
Sit in the top of the garden and soak in the view while sipping on a glass of wine.
With of course your favorite person in the world.

,,Enchanting World of Floras,5.0,,Gardens by the Bay is a remedy to the hustle and bustle of this ultra-busy urban world. The super grove tree", the cloud forest," and the flower dome are a feast to the senses. These man-made facilities at the Gardens by the Bay offers a quick retreat from the noise of a usual city life. Stroll at your own pace and find your own fantastic experience!"""
,,must visit this when you are in Singapore,4,,"GBTB has the best designed flowers and ambience for all people, young and old! Must visit this if you are a Singaporean, right in your own country!",,
,,Outstanding visitor attraction,5,,"Outstanding, amazing, sensational -what more it there to say. An absolute must for the visitor. The only thing to worry about it that it requires quite a long walk to get to it and this is a problem in the Singapore heat. I am not sure if there is a way for a taxi to get close to the domes. Once you get inside it is air conditioned so leave plenty of time to wander around and admire.",,
,,worth visiting,5,,"Gardens by the Bay, it shows a great planning an execution in creating these wonderful gardens. The maintenance is excellent.",,
,,awesome do the cloud walk around the indoor waterfall .magical!!!!,5,,wow do it awesome once in a lifetime experience beautiful plants and skywalk is exceptional .get there late arvo transition to night to get best line up and city / tree views,,
,,Orchard festival,5,,Just outstanding you have to pay to enter but it is well worth it best example of gardening I have seen,,
,,Man-made facilities,4,,My long time friend in Singapore recommended to visit the place during night time otherwise it would be too hot during the day. The ground is well maintained and lighted. The negative side is that the whole garden is based on man-made structures including those steel frames which were decorated with all sorts of LED lights. Too much artificially made structures.,,
,,Well worth the trip and entry price.,5,,Well worth the entry price. Stay until dark so you can see the lighted trees outside the gardens. The rain forest was excellent. So make sure your ticket price includes not only the gardens but the rain forest too.,,
,,Fantastic in every way!,5,,I came here on a day stopover with my daughter. We spent it here. There鈥檚 so much to do and see. The Cloud Forest dome was fascinating with the waterfall and the temperature providing a welcome relief from the heat. I鈥檇 definitely go in there first. The super tree walkway is breathtaking but hard for someone like me who suffers from vertigo! Worth doing all the same. The Flower Dome has so many orchids I was overwhelmed. The Baobabs and Olive trees were my favourites. Hard to get such mature specimens in a glasshouse. Finally you must stay for the light-show in the evening. It鈥檚 thrilling. I鈥檒l never forget it.,,
,,Takes your breath away!,5,,"We visited here three times, in four days! The first visit we explored the Domes as we only had limited time. To be honest, if we had of arrived a bit earlier we would have had time to explore the Domes & the Super Tree's as well. I would suggest a min, of four hours. We went back in the evening (on a guided Night Tour with Hippo) to see the Super Tree's Light Show (goes for approx. 15mins each night). The entire experience was simply breath taking, even if you are not an avid gardner, just the architectural scale of the structures, the science behind the water filtration systems etc - it is all just fantastic. Food/Drink we didn't find plentiful - but maybe we weren't looking in the right places. There is a McDonalds & a Coffee Shop that we visited, but couldn't find anything else. Simply beautiful.",,
,,Breathtaking,5,,"Every day at 7pm and 8pm there is a light show. And I've been there even after work on Mondays. It honestly is breathtaking and calming, like seeing stars dancing in the sky. Recommended for those who love and appreciate beautiful views.Wear something comfy, long pants so that it wont hurt to sit on the grass. Best to bring a mat!",,
,,"Post dusk, early evening clarity",5,,"After dinner, LOML and me strolled from Marina Bay Sands hotel to the evening show at the Gardens. The heat of the day remained heavy for the slow walk around the bay to the gardens. As we got closer we could hear the music and see the flashes of snychronised lighting, the sea of people drew us closer to the centre of action, beneath the towering sky walkway. You cannot describe this in a brief post, it is something that has to be experienced. Don't worry about the crowds, it is safe, it is family friendly and most of the efficiency of the ""Singaporean"" system means when you want to leave, along with 10,000 others, the combination of buses, taxis and MRT, has you on your way in around 15/20 minutes. Now try doing that New York!!!",,
,,Artificial,2,,"Look, I get that there's not a lot to do in Sinapore so they created these gardens. And it's fine to walk around there. And the 15-minute light show was worth 7 minutes of my time. But we paid 16 Sing to get into the ""Cloud Forest"" which was a complete and utter waste of money. Man-made waterfalls, and lots of plants, both real and fake, and absolutely nothing worth seeing.

My advice: Do the free stuff, skip the pay stuff.",,
,,Second Visit,5,,"We first visited. 2 years ago, it has moved on displays and we visited when the Orchid show was on that in itself was worth the experience",,
,,Delight to the eyes!!,4,,"This is a beautifully and interestingly designed garden.. and surely sets itself apart from any garden concept!!.. i went with my group during the day and it was a quick stop over. But the last day of the trip, we had some ""me time"" to spend, n i just happened to walk out into this garden from the train station at the sands. i had no idea about the evening musical show n as i went closer to these huge towers, i saw people sitting or lying down on the floor.. and before i could realise.. it all darkened and the play of music and light began!! mesmerising!! stunning!! For me.. It was a perfect end to my beautiful trip to Singapore!!",,
,,Beautiful Place! Go!,5,,"We were not expecting much from this place, but what a nice surprise. You might find a bit pricey before you go, but for us it was worth every penny. Don鈥檛 miss out",,
,,Impressiv!,5,,Good place to relaxe and it's one if a kind in the world! The show with the supertrees is stunning!!!,,
,,Stunning by night,4,,"We visited on our first evening in Singapore, just after it got dark. Lights have a stunning effect on the trees. We'll certainly return at during the day at the end of our trip.",,
,,An absolute must see.,5,,This is one of the modern wonders of the world. It is the Kew Gardens of this century. Both domes must be visited. They are fantastic. The displays in the flower dome change regularly. My wife goes every month. The Gardens cost like S$3bn and most of the spend is underground. But the above ground is truly unique when you understand what is being achieved in those domes.,,
,,Visit to Gardens by the Bay.,5,,"We went to the new gardens today and what an exceptional exhibit of plants and structures it is. As an orchid fancier, I was amazed at the variety and colours available in these amazing plants. It is well laid out and an easy stroll down the passageways between the displays.",,
,,Sensational gardens,5,,Amazing the way this garden has been put together. Easy walk around the different levels with lifts for those unable to walk too far. Reasonable entry fee with restaurants to stop at and enjoy a coffee or meal. Kids will love the gardens with elves.,,
,,Singapore Garden Festival 2018,5,,"I attended the Singapore Garden Festival, held at Gardens By The Bay from 21 July to 3 August 2018. The festival mainly promoted the Orchid Extravaganza exhibition in the Flower Dome conservatory, featuring a Peranakan theme directed by local filmmakerRoyston Tan. I attended the free 20 minutes tour held at 11am and 3pm daily at the flower field, which was lighthearted and informative. Alternatively, the Garden Trail brochure also provided details about the orchids. I also visited the Cloud Forest conservatory to walk around and within the misty man-made mountain. I was pleased to find that the Cloud Forest conservatory had additional displays of orchids too, which was a welcome change because the Cloud Forest usually does not have a changing exhibition.

As part of the Singapore Garden Festival, The Meadow and Supertree Grove had multiple installations and activities. Free, fast, and frequent buggy service was provided within The Meadow and Supertree Grove. I participated in a free floral jamming session in The Meadow (Stage) in which I learned about flower arrangement and made my own creation. Of course, I could not miss the Garden Rhapsody show at the Supertree Grove held at 7.45pm and 8.45pm daily, which was stunning even though I have watched it several times in the past.

Gardens By The Bay is easily accessible from Bayfront MRT Station Exit B. While Gardens By The Bay is usually well worth a visit, it is even more spectacular and fun during the biennial Singapore Garden Festival. To top it off, the staff members were all very helpful, friendly, and enthusiastic. I spent a total of 8 hours here. Highly recommended.",,
,,Superb designs and gardens,5,,Come here fro a wonder and was amazed at the structures and designs. It is great fro a jog or just to wonder about. The hotel is nearby so you can make a day of it. Views at night make for great photos.,,
,,Outstanding,5,,"We were so looking forward to our visit to Gardens by the Bay, and were 100% satisfied. Truly amazing plants and creations. A must see. Easy strolling, take sunhat, sun cream and water. Just allow time to take it easy and enjoy",,
,,Wonderful,5,,Amazing design. Beautiful light show which we watched from the balcony of our hotel room at Marina Bay Sands.,,
,,As usual a must see when in Singapore,5,,"Gardens by the bay is a must do think when in Singapore. Even if you have been here before. The lightshow is always something new.

A tip is to avoid the que by the elevated walk and go for a drink in the highest super tree , There is no que and its only 20 bucks incl a drink and with a super view",,
,,Evening light show,5,,Beautiful place to visit. You don鈥檛 have to pay unless you go into the gardens area itself. We went along in the evening as part of City Tours for the light show (to opera music). The show is around 10-15 minutes long. I鈥檝e seen a lot of light shows on my 4 month backpacking experience and this was by far the best. Absolutely beautiful and a lovely way to see the sunset.,,
,,A thrilling experience!,5,,"The sound and light show was out of this world! The orchid garden is amazing, and one doesn't stop wondering how a small nation like Singapore regularly conjures up such attractions!",,
,,You can easily spend a full day here. Wear comfortable shoes!,5,,"Truly amazing oasis within the city. Only spent 4 hours here as we had a lot we wanted to see, and we only got to see maybe 1/4 of it in that time. Would have loved the chance to explore more but simply ran out of time. Definitely make sure you get in to see the Cloud Forest though!",,
,,Nice,4,,"I must say for a country that doesn鈥檛 own a forest, they know how to build one. Pretty amazing. Love the cloud forest dome.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay Singapore,5,,Heaven on earth is what I can describe for the Gardens by the Bay a must visit for lovers / family and young ones / to know what the world has to offer us in terms of natural flora,,
,,Music & Light Show (free of charge) - Garden Rhapsody and Spectra in Singapore,5,,"The Garden Rhapsody at the Supertree Grove is a wonderful performance on a daily basis 7.45pm, 8.45pm. Romantic opera music combined with a beautiful light show. It last 15 min. I recommend watching the 7:45pm performance and then take a walk through the Hotel Marina Bay Sands and the shopping mall and exit on the site of city view to see the Spectra Water and Light Show at 9pm.",,
,,Excellent place to watch flowers and rare species of plants.,5,,Excellent place to watch flowers and rare species of plants. Good place to click photos and amazing back drops at many places.,,
,,Sensory overload,5,,Waaaaaa! This place was amazing. With beauty and ancient trees everywhere it's so much to take in. The visual beauty and the smell of the flowers and the water fall and the little hidden figures like the Cheshire and everything about this place were just amazing. The focus on conservation was a wonderful touch too.,,
,,Amazing!,5,,Just go. This place is amazing. One of the highlights of Singapore. Get a seat / nice spot early for the light show. Tree walk not too scary even for a person who is scared of heights like me.,,
,,Just wow,5,,"This place is great. It has two domes that you pay for and are beautful inside. Totally worth it, they've put a lot of work into both and maintained them well.
The gardens outside of the domes are stunning too. There is a free light show at night which is brilliant!",,
,,A must see 馃憤馃憤,5,,"What a great place to visit: we first viewed the Grove trees, walked the skybridge and had a zip in the 鈥榯reetop鈥?bar, then visited the Cloud Forest (as suggested by others on Tripadvisor), had a drink at the rooftop bar at the Marina by the Bay hotel and returned after a bite to see the sound and light show. This was a perfect combination for an unforgettable afternoon and evening. One small thing to improve for others is to take the times of the clouds in mind when visiting the Cloud Forest as that鈥檚 only a few times a day. It is a great escape from the heat .",,
,,Amazing Experience,4,,It was simply divine an amazing experience for all the family. At the start we thought the kids wouldn鈥檛 enjoy but they loved it as it was fascinating and very exciting even my husband enjoyed! The cloud forest was by far the best with a waterfall and high up walkways. Overall a lovely way to spend a morning.,,
,,Love this place,5,,"This place is truly amazing, and no trip to Singapore is complete without visiting this place. We also attended during the time of the Garden Festival.",,
,,Very Nice,5,,"Its must see! It has Cloud Forest, Flower dome, Super tree grove and OCBC Skyway walk. They also have a laser show at night which is worth watching.",,
,,Finest place in singapore,5,,"superb place to visit. very very good maintenance and beautiful plants,flowers etc etc.Enjoyed a lot.",,
,,One of the iconic places in Singapore,5,,"Beautiful displays in the flower & Cloud forest domes. I am impressed with the arrays of flowers being displayed & the items being showcased. Best to go around 4pm where you can explore the domes first before you enjoy the lighting display of the groves. In addition, buy tickets online to avoid long queues at the ticket counters, especially during weekends.",,
,,The domes are worth the price!,5,,"Even in the stifling Singapore heat, the Gardens are pleasant to walk around with plenty of spots in the shade. If you do struggle, you can pay a few dollars and get the shuttle over to the domes. They are very impressive and well worth the money. The skywalk is good too, and cheaper, but really just gives a higher view as opposed to the different things you see in the domes.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay Singapore,5,,"We had planned this trip a few months ahead - and we were on a 2 night stopover in Singapore on our way back from the UK

Visited the gardens by night on the first day we were there - it was spectacular to see the Supertrees and we took some fantastic night time photographs. It was still quite busy around 10PM, but access was easy and it was all well lit.

The following morning we visited again and experienced the Skyway which was brilliant - the views and the flowers, and again lots of photographs! We had pre booked tickets for the domes - entering the Flower Dome first and that was amazing, plenty to look at laid out really well to give access and allow you to see the entire exhibition.

The Cloud Forrest was next - again access was easy and efficient - This dome is spectacular - starting at the top and working your way down, there is so much to see and experience. You certainly feel like you are floating as you walk round the different levels.

All in all this was a really good visit, the facilities were excellent and everything seemed to run like clockwork.",,
,,SGF,4,,"I enjoyed the SGF and Orchid Extravaganza thoroughly. The event catered to diverse audience. I would like to highlight for your consideration - more tram rides to be catered for the elderly as the festival was spread out and lots of walking is required.

The staff who were on duty were very helpful and friendly.

I visited SGF on 22 July with my 82-year old mum so enjoyed the festival tremendously but she was not able to cover the entire festival ground due to too much walking.",,
,,Natural touch in Singapore,4,,"A beautiful natural habitat created for plants, flowers and trees. Someone who admires nature will surely love this place. It's built quite uniquely and nicely. The display is spot on. The forest theme is pretty amazing and the waterfall is brilliant. The lights at night lit up the place totally and the light show is pretty good as well. Gardens by the bay should definitely be in your to-do Singapore list.",,
,,One of the coolest things ever,5,,"This place is incredible and I mean every word I say. This place should be visited by everyone who goes to Singapore. The buildings fantastic, the plants fantastic, the night lights incredible. I鈥檇 go right back if I could. 10/10",,
,,Nice place to walk,5,,"At night time the show is very nice and free. It is also a nice place to run, or bike. People who love flower and trees, it is is definitely a place to visit. And a nice place for the sunset.",,
,,"A place where you find peace, satisfaction, environment to breath and better mental health",5,,"Gardens By The Bay -
Pros -
Next to Marina Bay Mall
You get awesome view of Marina Bay Mall, Singapore flyer, and night life view of Singapore.
Very easy location to find. Get down at Bayfront MRT station and then follow the instructions and route written of the sign boards at MRT
Evening is very busy at Gardens By The Bay because of awesome Light and music show. There are 2 shows at 7:45 and 8:45 PM. But, it is must watch. Better you get a seat and lie down to watch the spectacular show.
Skywalk on the Tree can be optional as it is nothing great.
Cloud Forest and FLower Dome must visit to see the indoor creation of a spectacular ecosystem. You don't feel like to come back.

Cons -
If you can't walk, then it will be difficult or you to cover the Park
Morning or afternoon can be hot as the weather of Singapore like that

Tips -
Carry umbrella, apply Sunscreen.
Always carry water bottle as you might feel thirsty frequently.

At the end of the day, it is a must visit place. And, after seeing the creation, you will cherish it for a longer time.",,

,,Singapore Gardens by the Bay,5,,"The only air-conditioned Garden in Singapore, at this beautiful country, everything is good, except hot and humid, taking your time enjoying a few thousand types of flowers from many part of the world, it is really a nice experience, I have been there 6 times in the past, just this month, I went two time, will sure visit the place again.",,
,,Must visit this area on Singapore trip.,5,,"CYC+CG ( 18.07.14 )
This area was most popular to Singapore tourist. There was including Super Tree, Flower Dome, Cloud Forest and big garden area. We visited this area at night, that's very good choice. Though there was too many people, but it was worth to visit. We enjoyed fountain show, seeing night view in Marina Bay and walking this area. This area was most place in our Singapore trip.",,
,,Excellent the most beautiful garden in the world,5,,"While in singapore definitely one of the places not to miss specialy at night with the supergroove three鈥檚 light show, absolutely the best ever garden i ever visit",,
,,do not go after 6pm!!,1,,"after sunset, there's no special lighting and the whole place look gloomy without the greenery. a waste of money. only go during daylight time.",,
,,Truly amazing !!!,5,,Housing all the beautiful flowers under one umbrella at different elevation and representing the global flora bouquet is a wonderful experience in in itself. It represents the initiative taken by the authorities to maintain such a beautiful ambience in singapore.,,
,,Just Amazing,5,,"When you visit Singapore as a tourist this has to be one of the top places to visit.
Walking round the flower garden and cloud walk is a experience that truly can't be missed.
Also at 19.45 and 20.45 there is a sound and light show that takes place at the Big Trees which is another experience that has to be seen.",,
,,Bring a sweater !,5,,"Being cold in Singapore is not a common experience, but if you are visiting G by the B, recommended you have another layer with you. The domes are temperature controlled to the point of being chilly. Apart from that, fab place for both adults and kids to visit, thoroughly recommended. When we were there, the waterfall one was the better of the two.

Do buy one ticket for the two domes (rather than two separate entrances), you can do both in a day.",,
,,A Wonderful Place,5,,Nice scenery and lightings! Best to go there in the evening to get the day time and night time look of Gardens by the Bay.,,
,,A must see!,5,,"I have never seen so many beutifull flowers in my life. Under the glas roof we reallyfelt relaxed. A little bit crowded on sunday, but still no problems to see and take pictures of so many nice flowers, waterfalls and plants",,

,,Good but need improvement,4,,The visit is good. We like the content of the gardening show. Only issue is that it is too spread out. Old and younger member are tired for the distance. Also too many dark room which elderly not able to see properly,,
,,Nice park with a Mesmerizing view,4,,"It is a nice place with beautiful landscape,
Place where you can spend family time like picnic in the park spending with little ones, They enjoy the short stage show..we enjoy the amazing view of The Marina Bay..

,,Amazing.,5,,"This place will surely amaze you specially with its size and management. Ideal time to go in the evening before sun sets so that you can have both views, day light one and with lights on. There is a music and light show in the evening 8.45 or so which is not worth missing at all. You can also go on the upper level with lift with extra payment but last entry to that is at 8.00pm so better keep that in mind.",,
,,Amazing garden,5,,An amazing walk where you see different types of orchids from all over the world and by night the spectacular lights where thousands of people gather to watch .,,
,,Remarkable Gardens by the Bay at night,5,,Gardens by the Bay was a pleasant surprise and particularly beautiful at night. With an unexpected musical operatic symphony with lights in the 鈥榯rees鈥?made this a memorable experience of a fabulous city/nation (Singapore: the lion city).,,
,,Must see just gorgeous,5,,Loved Gardens by the Bay. Beautifully put together and maintained. We took the little train around and it was a great way to see the gardens avoiding the heat. Well worth the visit.,,
,,Singapore's iconic gardens that offer thousands of horticultural exhibits and events with leisure and edutainment.,5,,"When government of Singapore designed and built city鈥檚 gardens it aimed at reclaiming and preserving city鈥檚 limited land space; to create nature greenery and to advocate the quality of living in one of the smallest nations and most crowded city state in the world. Gardens by the Bay are the realizations of government鈥檚 commitments. There are three nature parks by the Bay-Bay South, Bay East and Bay Central. Bay South Garden is the largest park; featuring two popular and most visited conservatories Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. So, my review is specifically related to Bay South Garden.
Flower Dome, world largest column-less glass dome replicates Mediterranean鈥檚 mild cool environment and semi-arid dry climate. It provides ideal environment to nurture many rare and exotic plants originally from five different continents. Visitors can learn varieties of succulent plants, unusual baobabs and bottle trees that are rare to the region; it also exhibits many theme display gardens and location-specified gardens. Cloud Forest represents region鈥檚 cool moist mountain climates. First thing comes to visitors鈥?sights is the skyscraper high of man-made water falls rushing down intermittently from top of the Cloud Mountain to keep the place similar to the tropical climates. The man-made Cloud Mountain is the centerpiece of the Cloud Forest where ferns, moss and tropical plants grow on top of other plants; cover the entire surface of the hollowed mountain structure. Visitors can take the elevator to the top of mountain-the Lost World- where you find many small and large intriguing Nepenthes, the insect eating pitcher plants and Venus-fly catchers. On your way down you get the close encounter with the waterfalls from inside walkway of the mountain structure. The Cloud Walk and Treetop Walk provide panorama and close-up views of epiphytes plants and many tropical vegetations growing around the Cloud Mountain. As you loop your ways down from Cloud Walk you will reach the Crystal Mountain where you find exhibits of stalactites, stalagmites and important elements of geological makeup. The Treetop Walk extended from the mountain structure gives visitors closer looks at the makeup of the glass structure and Marina Bay views. Down to the ground level you will find your way to the enchanting Secret Garden, a newly added theme garden replicates tropical cool moist environment of limestone forests and caves. It showcases thousands of moist loving vegetations, rare tiny orchids, small misty falls, and wooden carvings of planet鈥檚 creatures on the tree trunks to entertain the viewers. It is one of the top three themed locations (Orchid garden, Lost World and Secret garden) I rated in Cloud Forest that is worthy of your time. Inside of the Cloud Forest also showcases region鈥檚 exotic flowers and varieties of beautiful orchid blossoms -the Singapore鈥檚 national flower. Orchid themed gardens are the most popular places for visitors鈥?photo ops.

Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are ideal places for all ages whether it is for educational purpose or for leisure entertainment. The structures designed to be environmental friendly by connecting the vent-cool system at nearby Supertree Grove where rain water is collected and then recycled to work as venting-cooling-watering functions for the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. The majority of the operational mechanism run on sustainable energy to minimize the environmental footprints. The sustainability and practicality exemplify high level of innovations for the greener environment.

After you finish your visits to the two conservatories, take a walk to the Supertree Grove and if weather permit you can visit OCBC Skywalk by pay SD $8 for the entry. If you have small children come along take them to Children鈥檚 Garden where water sprinklers jetting intermittently from the playground while water buckets made like Nepenthes Pitcher Plants filling and emptying water from the overhead posts. It鈥檚 a fun place for the children and adults to get wet and cooled off from hot humid weather.

Bay South Garden can be reached by taking DT (blue Downtown line) get off at DT16 or CE (yellow Circle Line Marina Bay Extension) line get off at CE1; follow the directions to Gardens by the Bay ticketing office. The standard adult ticket for non-Singapore residents is SD $28 and 10% off for the Singapore Airlines passengers (just show your boarding pass). It covers admissions to the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest. The park shuttle services are available for SD $3 per person if you want to skip the walks from the ticketing area to the entrance of the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. You can get re-entry permit by having a stamp on you hand when you exit the exhibit building.
Gardens by the Bay covers three locations but all are by Marina Bay. If you have only half day then I suggest you visit Bay South Garden, the biggest of the three nature parks.",,
,,Cool.,4,,"Was disappointed when it was smaller than I was led to believe, particularly the outside walking platform, but such an amazing place. Gardens meets Science, whats not to like.",,
,,Serene yet but isolated garden,5,,A big garden with numerous variety of plants. There was some sort of festival going on but realised that you hv to pay to enter. Not willing to spend the amount I walk around and found several booths set up displaying and selling many types of plants. Itself is refreshing and learning from the stalls on caring n growing plants. Bought some airplants n an orchid after a short lesson on plant care from a stall. Very refreshing walking round the garden. The weather is rather hot n humid though.,,

,,hillstreet coffee shop at gardens by the bay,2,,"visited the Singapore Garden Festival at Gardens by the bay yesterday. it was a lovely and wonderful display of international flower cum landscape competition. fantastic and organised management of buggy transportation of different stops. overall was a delightful experience.

the only Downside was the hillstreet coffee shop which we visited for the first time. ordered nasi lemak, chicken rice set and chendol. food standard was of average. chicken rice was nothing compared to stalls elsewhere in the food court selling the same thing. the chicken prolly was overcooked as the meat was quite tough. condiments e.g. chilli can be improved. as the place is a tourist attraction, may I suggest the hillstreet coffee shop management to look into the food standard..considered the price customer paid for..which is slightly higher than elsewhere.

another observation we had..was a staff was shouting at a group of 3 young gals..gesturing to them a certain section was off limits to patron. maybe it will be more appropriate to approach the gals gently..directing them to the appointed table available instead.

the above suggestions..i sincerely hope the coffee shop management will seriously look into it.",,
,,Singapore garden festival 2018,4,,"It鈥檚 my first visit to GBB, happy to meet PM Lee due to this SGF.

As our ticket only allows us to visit one conservatory, we decided to go cloud forest. It鈥檚 amazing and exciting to get to see the waterfall.

Thereafter we just roam around to enjoy the cool environment.

At the meadow, there鈥檚 plenty of tentage showcasing the highlights of this festival.

For a discounted ticket to GBB, it鈥檚 indeed worth the visit.",,

,,Excellent experience,5,,"Excellent experience at flower Dome. If discounts for credit cards or passion cards are also extended to online booking would be ever great, it would certainly encourage me and family to visit more often.",,
,,Wonderland,5,,It was beautiful to say the least.Also since it was a hot day it was refreshing amidst the waterfall and being surrounded by greenery.The light show was the proverbial cherry on the cake.Evening well spent!,,
,,Fantastic Gardens,5,,"So impressed by the huge gardens and 2 dorms with so many variations of plants/trees + waterfall.
I liked the botanic garden near by Shangrila hotel, but this is such incredible.
The lighting event on those huge tree decorations were awesome! and it's free!
Amazing really.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay - Singapore Garden Festival,4,,Beautiful displays in the Flower Dome and around the festival grounds. Orchids are the feature but be surprised by the scented garden and special artistic creations. Wonderful!,,
,,Outstanding Gardens,5,,Go Later in the day around 4pm and by the time you have done the gardens you can stay for the light show. Go over by Train Cost $4( covers both ways ) and to other stations on Sentosa,,
,,Amazing Place,5,,"We visited the Gardens on Sunday 22nd July, day 2 of the Garden Festival. What a fantastic place with wonderful exhibitions. Along the way some local Girl Guides asked if they could give us a free Guided Tour. They were great, we expect they were doing some community work to improve their skills. We recommend everyone stopping over at Singapore should visit the Gardens even when the main Festival is not on.",,
,,Amazing!!,5,,"Hats off to whoever is the master mind of this amazing masterpiece. A great place for plant,flower and nature lovers and great place for photography. A lot of effort, time and innovative ideas have gone into creating this and a proud result for Singapore. One can spend a whole day wondering though and admiring the various areas.I actually should have arrived earlier as I missed out on the other areas such as Chinese Garden and Indian Garden and so forth as it had gotten dark.
I had first gone to the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest Dome which both require tickets to enter.They both were marvelous and worth the money spent. There are various other gardens which are free. The highlight of the day was the light presentation which happened after 7pm.The super trees were lit up in great colors accompanied by music and transformed us to an enchanted world.
A must for any tourists visiting Singapore!",,
,,Group tour.,4,,16 of us and the place was great to see. Entry was disorganised and with the heat was frustrating. Getting further in saw crowd dissipate.. Really service available but not frequent enough. Worth the visit.,,
,,Beautiful Oasis in Modern City,5,,"A short walk away from skyscrapers you can find beautiful flower and bush arrangements from all over the world in an airconditioned in door area. Very well done and worth to see, if you are a garden and flower fan.",,
,,THE most Amazing plave,5,,"This place is so breathtaking beautiful, visiting here is a must. There is so much to see and do in the cloud and flower domes so would advise to spend the day there. Plenty of places to eat and drink all no the way also. The evening light show is not to be missed!! Absolutely stunning!! For a small fee you can go up in the lift to access the flower walkway where you will get some of the best views in Singapore!!!",,
,,Amazingly designed and full of life,5,,"The domes are meticulously curated and packed full of a huge variety of plants. We were particularly pleased with the large number of succulents and orchids. We also enjoyed the cave section of the cloud forest dome, which was an unexpected treat. The super tree grove was as beautiful and iconic as we had hopes from seeing so many pictures of them online.",,
,,A must see for Plant and Garden enthusiasts,5,,"Breathtaking landscapes, an amazing day spent walking around the gardens. Charge your phones and make sure your battery's in your camera are charged as you're going to be taking a lot of photos all day long.",,
,,Nice gardens!,4,,It is a must see for everyone who will visit Singapore....you must be there in afternoon until evening so that you can see all the views and attractions in daytime and night time.,,
,,Beautiful,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is simply stunning. I鈥檝e never seen something so beautifully done before. The different areas are easy to get to and worth the time to appreciate!

You can go up the flower and do a little skywalk/viewing platform - it鈥檚 not busy as they only allow a certain number on at a time, well worth it!

It can be quite hot so a hat and sunscreen is highly recommended!!",,
,,Spectacular,5,,The free night light show is simply stunning. There was classic music as well. You can go for a 7.45 or 8.45 show. There are many food options even after the last show. Cabs are plentiful.,,
,,Magnifucent,5,,"Absolutely outstanding! Loved the Flower Dome and Cloud Dome. Loved the show at night with the trees all lit up. Loved the skywalk. Loved the views. All outstanding and a must in Singapore. Got there using hop on/off bus, but got s taxi back to the hotel after the shows. Wonderful magical place in Singapore!",,
,,The grandest of them all,5,,"Gardens by the Bay are recognised by the Super Tree Groves rising as high as the skyline. The three conservatories are an absolute delight to be in, tons of flowers and the most charming Cloud Forest. The light and sound show at Super Tree Grove is not to be missed!",,
,,Early mornings and late evenings for a gentler walk in the park,4,,"The park is very well-maintained, easy to access and navigate.
For me, the highlight was the Garden Rhapsody at night. If you like movie soundtrack, challenge yourself to identify each song/movie. Pretty easy and a wonderful show for your senses. (Just a quick warning for those sensitive to mosquitoes: bring repellent for your walk back to the metro station! My friends said there were none, but I am a mosquito magnet and can attest that they are some and very bity! All ok during the day though.)

The OCBC Skyway at Supertree Grove was too expensive for what it was. You can get a good view ont he park from other places for free. I found the other attractions very refreshing, but not so great... not bad either, just manage your expectations! After having visited the Botanic Gardens (a bit further out the city) and the hike through Mount Faber & Southern Ridges, the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest were not as impressive as I expected. If I were to go again, I woudl most definitely skip these two and head for the wilderness and botanic gardens again! :)",,
,,Mind blowingly beautiful,5,,"Make sure you catch the music and light show in the early evening. It is best viewed a little bit off, as this gives you a better overview. Especially the tower with the local far east plants is spectacular.",,
,,Aircon environment under the hot sun,5,,A great place with air condition environment in a sunny hot city. Nice place to see floral and different type of plants.,,
,,Over rated.,3,,"save yourself the taxi fare of heading down to this pace (although taxis are the only thing that is good value in Singapore) and go to the botanic gardens instead. They are much larger, have much more variety and are actually real.",,
,,Garden Festival July 2018,4,,"The festival was held amongst the Supertrees, in the Meadows and the Flower Dome. The entrance in the Supertree Grove area was small and squeezy - some wheelchair users had difficulty due to the very narrow passageways. The Lost Forest was a misnomer, occupying merely an area a few feet around one tree from the entrance - you definitely wouldn't get lost in it; its more of an issue of "" so this is it?"" We waited at the buggy station for a ride to the Meadows. Not many people, though it was the first day of the Festival, and it was a quick and smooth ride which saved us some time and walking. We walked through some of the zones, and particularly liked the balcony gardens - as we were looking for ideas for our own balcony. The orchid displays were in the Flower Dome, which was a really cool place to be and to admire the stunning blooms. Overall a pleasant time spent at the event. You can choose to buy tickets only to the displays outside of the 2 domes or buy the package that includes both domes and the garden area. The signages and instructions could be better, but the staff were very willing to answer queries.",,
,,A must visit Gardens with fabulous lights & sound show,5,,"Located near the Marina Bay Sands & has two conservatories (domes) - Flower dome & Cloud forest (SGD 28 per head) along with skywalk (requires a seperate ticket of SGD 8 per person). I would strongly recommend to do skywalk as it provides superb views of entire gardens, Marina bay sands, Singapore flyer. Ideal time to visit is in the late evenings by 4-5 pm so that one comfortably cover both the conservatories & skywalk. Do not miss the lights & sound show- 'Opera by the bay' which is open for all & happens near the supertree cove (2 shows of 15 mins at 7.45 pm & 8.45 pm). Try to reach before time so that you cab get best place to stand or sit as it can get really crowded. Both the conservatories are beautiful & amazingly fully air conditioned. There is nice waterfall in the cloud forest dome where you can go right upto the top- an experience not be missed. Overall it's a fabulous place to visit & should be definitely in the must do attractions of Singapore.",,
,,Light show visit,5,,"This facility is a must on any visit to Singapore. Try and time it for the light show at 7.30pm, for this, take something to lay on as the best view is from looking up.",,
,,Beautiful Architecture wonder!,5,,"This is one of my favorite places to take photos in Singapore. You can totally see the sunset and sunrise from this place. I love the super trees. These are massive architectural wonders that stands like trees and lights up at night. Fun fact, these super trees are powered by solar power! The view from the rooftop bar in the super tree is amazing!",,
,,Go atg night,4,,Make sure to go at night but arrive early to walk the catwalk as it closes early. GGreat views and fun.,,
,,Excellent Day,5,,"There is a lot to be seen here whatever your age. We spent most of our day in the Cloud Forest and the Flower Pavilion, which were wonderful. We could have easily stayed longer, but there is a lot of walking involved, and in the heat, you need to pace yourself and stay hydrated. The Sky Walk was temporarily closed because of thunder and lightening. So we have it a miss, but it looks fun. Beware the shuttle bus costs SGD 3 each. It should be free and part of the ticket, but it isn鈥檛! A fascinating experience overall and well worthwhile.",,
,,Stunning.,5,,"What a beautiful place to visit. Locals took is there at 7.45 pm. Excellent timing, since a kind of music/light show starts then. It鈥檚 really nice and abovd all you don鈥檛 have to pay to see the gardens. You only have to pay an entrance fee if you wanna go into the flowerdome (so don鈥檛 overpay!).",,
,,Well worth it!,5,,"The Gardens by the Bay is a phenomenal attraction. No expense has been spared in the construction and the ticket price of $28/adult is money well spent. I was particularly taken with the numerous sculptures fitted into the displays, the grove of ancient olive trees, the splendour of the Orchid gardens and the amazing Cacti collection. The overall majesty of the domes was spectacular to say the least. Be prepared to walk a few kilometres to enjoy this attraction.",,
,,Life changing - must see,5,,"I had high expectations for the Gardens and they did not disappoint. This is truly something you must experience in person. The super trees are incredible. Mariana bay sands is a sight to see. Over all just incredible area. You feel like you're walking on a different planet. Such beautiful views. Plenty of shopping, restaurants and museums on the other side by the water (can even see Otters if you're lucky). Wonderful area.",,
,,Beautiful Garden by the Bay,5,,"Beautiful Garden for a walk. Great for singles, couples or families.
If you need to eat, there are a variety of options at Satay by the Bay.
There's also a wonderful light show in the evening at the Super Trees Grove. Perfect for lying down on the greens to relax and enjoy the lights and music.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is a truly beautiful place to visit and it is all air conditioned. You will need at least 3 hours, but you could spend a good part of a day just taking it all in.",,
,,Beautiful!,4,,"It鈥檚 definitely a cool place to explore. It was extremely overcrowded and became overwhelming at one point. A better system for going inside the Cloud Forest and the Flower dome needs to be established. The park is worth a walk through, I鈥檝e never seen something so unique. It鈥檚 pretty cool. I would only go into the Cloud Forest id I had to pick between two, but on a quiet day - I would do both. Super unique!! Loved it :)",,
,,Amazing Visit to Gardens by the Bay,5,,"We visited Gardens by the Bay in April 2018. We were originally only going to see the sound and light show in the evening, but we arrived at around 6pm, and decided to go into both of the domes. My husband initially said it was too expensive, but we went in anyway.
The Cloud Forest was out of this world! It was so amazing, and we both thought it was worth every penny - we stayed in for about an hour and a quarter. The Flower Dome was also very nice, but we didn't need more than half an hour to go through it.
The Supertree Grove was also wonderful, and to think that the sound and light show there is free, is pretty amazing.
Altogether, an attraction not to be missed in Singapore.",,
,,Romantic walk through the garden,5,,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our walk through the gardens. The grounds are huge with plenty to see and explore. The gardens by the domes can be crowded but further south is more private. Definitely a must see in Singapore and also free to enter (the Flower Dome, Cloud Forest, and Skyway have an admission fee). The bathrooms were also immaculately clean and were nicely designed. The weather can be hot and humid so take a bottle of water with you.",,
,,"Stunning, amazing place!",5,,"a MUST if you visit the city. Wonderful park to enjoy nature and learn about sustainability. Perfect to walk, to relax with friends, family, children... You can not miss the daily light show. I would not recommend going up to the bar tree.",,
,,One of a kind !,5,,One of a kind garden in the world. The best part is the going up and admiring the mountain of plants on the way down. It d say it鈥檚 the most worth while attraction during my trip to Singapore compared to the other ones I went. It鈥檚 quite high so not the greatest for people afraid of height and parents with toddlers running around - gives you heart attacks!,,
,,Good view,3,,Good view and very relaxing place in a good weather condition. Drinking fountain however isnt working,,
,,Nice place,4,,"Looks best in the evening. The sound and light show is really nice. It's hot and humid to walk around, but you have to do/ see it.",,
,,Most modern and beautiful,5,,It鈥檚 the most modern and beautiful in the world. Everyone should visit this place. Actually Singapure is all amazing.,,
,,A must see,4,,This is a place you must see when in Singapore. One dome contains flowers and the other a huge waterfall and lots of interesting plants. Expect to use 3 hours in total for a person that has average interest in botany.,,
,,Interesting Place,5,,"Interesting visit, especially the Cloud Forrest is very impressive. Flower Gardens only for flower and plant lovers.",,
,,Best gardens on earth,5,,Overwhelming. Excellent. Beyond comprehension and compare. Went during the orchid show and what a delight! Do not miss.,,
,,Watch the light and sound show,4,,It is free and worth your time. Go there about 20/25mins ahead of time to grab a fine spot. Definitely watch it.,,
,,Fantastic,5,,The entire show was fantastic and presented in buildings thT are fantastic. The variety of flowers trees and succulents are one of a kind. One of best flower shows on earth.,,
,,Lovely but overpriced,5,,Like most of Singapore.. what should be free or cheap is costly. I think it will be better at night. Will come back for a look.,,
,,perfect but not so good as the zoon,4,,perfect nice flowers all over the world lost of it you see also in the zoo . We liked it but it is much walking,,
,,Beautiful indoor/outdoor Gardens,5,,"2 indoor conservatories among the gardens adjacent to Marina Bay Sands. The multi story Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome. Lovely and cool, beautifully presented gardens. Very interesting. We did the daylight version, but at night it would take on a completely new perspective with the Light and Sound shows.",,
,,Beautiful experience,5,,"Don鈥檛 miss the evening show, truly spectacular (and it鈥檚 free!!). Get there early plenty to see and marvel at.",,
,,A delightful experience,5,,A wonderful place to visit. The Flower Dome has plants from all over the world and it is coolin there. Also the orchids are breathtaking Th Cloud Forest is also amazing Well worth a visit,,
,,Wonderful Garden Festival,5,,"When to the first day of the Garden Festival held inside Gardens by the Bay an absolutely must see wonderful exhibition, incredible plants & blooms a good tip get there early to beat the crowds.",,
,,Light and opera show,5,,We are so glad we visited in the evening and managed to catch the light and opera show. Absolutely beautiful and memorable experience,,
,,Spectacular light show,5,,Missed the light show on our last visit so made sure we got to see it this time. The light show is spectacular and runs at 7:45 and 8:45 nightly. We say the early show then had a bite and moved locations and watched again. Garden is great by the day but the lights are wonderful at night,,
,,Impressive and puzzling,4,,"An impressive and beautiful location to visit. A lot of perfectly maintained greeneries, wonderful nature and impressive architecture at the Cloud Forest and the Floor Dome. What puzzled me quite a lot was the amount of stalactites and stalagmites at the expo. Add far as it looked they were real what would mean that they took (and probably destroyed partially or fully) a or some caves. They topic is sustainability what would be a complete joke of those natural sculptures are real and would destroy the whole meaning of the exposition...",,
,,A must for anyone,5,,The contents of the domes and their contents are beautiful and awe inspiring but the free light show at 19.30 and 20.30 on the large tree like vents is an absolute must. One of the most beautiful sights you can see in Singapore....and it's free!!,,
,,Beautiful Garden,5,,Been to Singapore a few times but this is my first time to actually go to Garden by the bay. We walk crossing through Marina Bay sands and enjoying the flower and cloud forest dome for the whole afternoon. Beautiful garden with a lot of beautiful plants. The orchid is my personal favorite. The design and the lighting of this place is awesome. I even stay to watch the Rhapsody. The ambiance of the song and lighting is awesome. I have never enjoy a Garden as much as this one.,,
,,Day at the Gardens by the Bay,5,,"Love this place and we have been to the gardens the last couple of times we have been in Singapore. Delighted that the festival of flowers was on this trip and we spent the entire day there.
Would definitely go back again next time we are here.",,
,,Absolutely stunning,5,,Visited with teenage daughter on last day of our holiday. Thought it wouldn't be her thing but she was so impressed with everything there as was I. A must see for anyone visiting Singapore,,
,,Beautiful light shows,5,,"I was travelling on a very tight budget in Singapore, so opted out of paying for the indoor tour part of Gardens by the Bay, choosing instead to just walk around and enjoy the outdoor gardens. They were beautiful, I arrived at around 6 and had a wander, then the sun started setting and the lights on the super trees came on so I sat and watched them for a while. Then, a wonderful light show on the trees began and it was FANTASTIC! I wasn't expecting it and it was a wonderful surprise. Lovely, free evening.",,
,,AMAZING ATTRACTION,5,,"gardens by the bay was too good, light show of garden by the bay is amazing we had enjoyed too much, lighting show has now any cost, it has free entry",,
,,Nice,4,,"We loved the way they maintained the gardens. It was colorful with the holiday/festival decking. Very good collections. The misting and falls were amazing too. It was pouring the day we visited, but with the enclosure didnt feel it at all. City view n the Singapore Flyer was amazing. Watched the fireworks and snow falls as well in the evening with the Marina Bay view.",,
,,Black mirror meeting Gardeners' world,5,,"Not being a gardening enthusiast, I was a bit sceptic about going there, but the Gardens turned out to be quite an experience! It's a whole experience. Recommended: going there in the late afternoon, before the light show.",,
,,Awesome,5,,"Spent over 4hrs in this truly amazing garden, capped off by one of two stunning light shows which occur each night. So much to see, allow yourself 4-5 hours.",,
,,Amazing experience,5,,Gardens by the bay is fabulous! Both day and night. We did both and loved the whole thing. We were there when they had an orchid spectacular. The domes are a must and the indoor waterfall is fabulous. Both domes are an expense that we were happy to pay but if you only want to walk through the gardens then this is free. A must do in Singapore I think.,,
,,Must do in Singapore,5,,I have been to Singapore many times but usually only as a stop over. This time we spent a few days in Singapore and I'm glad we did. The gardens by the bay are sensational. from the 6 story indoor waterfall to the magnificent rainforest the whole area is stunning.,,
,,Enticing evening @GBTB,4,,"What a lovely place to spend your evening, the heritage gardens experiencing the beautiful elegance of Flower Dome followed by cool highlands of Cloud Forest topping it up with the Light & Sound show.",,
,,Nice stroll,5,,"No visit to Singapore is complete without this impressive tourist spectacle. Walk the sky walk for great views, and be sure to see the orchid exhibit through August 鈥?8.",,
,,Beautiful place,5,,Was an amazing place with so many beautiful plants. Very creative and peaceful place. Teenagers didn鈥檛 appreciate it though.,,
,,Well worth a visit,5,,"This is another gem in Singapore and well worth a visit. Sadly, the day we visited the Flower Dome was closed but the Cloud Forest more than made up for that. It truly is wonderful.",,
,,Very good!,4,,"I visited the Gardens by the Bay domes with my family, and we all loved it. Especially the 鈥榗loud forest鈥? is a great eye opener to kids about our planet and how we are affecting it. I would recommend you going there!",,
,,Beautiful gardens,4,,We visited the Gardens and we into the flower dome who had a magnificent display of orchids. The variety was very big and the displays where very pretty and well displayed and looked after. Likewise the cloud forest dome lots of beautiful flowers and plant in the amazing display Centre. Outside of the domes the gardens surrounding are also very well maintained and manicured with the large avatar looking structures. Very worth while visit and not far from Marina Bay sands.,,
,,Concrete Jungle,5,,A mind blowing environment. The place was captivating and breathtaking especially during the night. There's a lot to see and admire. A must visit with your children as they will surely enjoy it.,,
,,First place to visit,5,,I think it's the first place to visit in Singapore. Very very nice. But you better go there from 6pm-7pm. It's beautiful with the light,,
,,Not to be missed,5,,This just blew us away ... don't miss it ... and I would suggest be in the actual gardens under the ' light trees' 30 minutes before it is to start. we did the light show at marina bay ... then had to travel with the hoards of people from the bay .. to the gardens light show and we're held back by the flow of people trying to get there. do the marina light show another night ... no biggie as it's very viable ... but don't miss the garden lights and music. was mesmerizing!,,
,,Nice gardens and amazing design,4,,"Gardens by the Bat is an extensive garden with free access. Nevertheless they charge you if you want to do the sky-walk or you want to access to the glass domes/green houses. The landscape it鈥檚 superb, making possible a lot of nice pictures with the towers of Marina Bay Sands as a background.
Only bad point is their hypocrite message of protection of the environment inside a cinema on a glass dome which temperature is at least 20 degrees lower than the outside. That space it鈥檚 everything but eco-friendly.",,
,,Must go to,5,,"They had amazing gardens! So worth it to visit this place. Spend an entire day here. I loved seeing their gardens. Although, I did make sure that we were there by the time they would do the mist but I don't think that the mist time was that amazing. Overall, good visit, wear something comfy and spend the whole day here!",,
,,Amazing,5,,Amazing place and also the roof top restaurant. You have to visit the restaurant next time you in Singapore.,,
,,Surpassed expectations,5,,"I had been told Gardens by the Bay were the must-see attraction when in Singapore but I did not realise how amazing they would be.

The whole area is absolutely beautiful and the gardens are immaculately maintained. Within the domes the displays are stunning and the view from the Skywalk is breath-taking.

If you go to Singapore do NOT miss Gardens by the Bay.",,
,,Too Good,5,,"This place can take a full day, so be aware, especially if you are a horticulture lover. There are so many places linked to this one main area. Once there, it is better to stay for the evening show as well, when the Supertree Grove lights up to an opera or a symphony. The Food Court, Satay by the Bay, was a bit of a disappointment.",,
,,Surprise and Delight,5,,"Went to the Gardens early one morning - it is cooler then - we didn鈥檛 get the full ticket package. We walked around first (free) and then decided to go to the cloud expo in the gardens. There is a small fee but actually well worth it. You go up to the top of the man made waterfall and get great views. Then meander down taking in some of the breathtaking surroundings. One tip to note, if you want to go back later in the day, perhaps at night, you can get a re entry stamp on the exit. In sum a delight to go to. If your after a coffee after head to the McCaf茅 which has an ok coffee to then stroll further round the gardens. Worth exiting via the big Marina Sands hotel as you can look back and get a bit of a view. Access can be gained back to the MRT.",,
,,Amazing!,5,,"These gardens really are worth visiting. I am not that into my plants or flowers but this place really is quite breathtaking particularly the two domes. Extremely well thought out, interesting and informative. Well worth the money!",,
,,A quick visit,3,,The light show was really enjoyable but I the other attraction that we paid to see were disappointing,,
,,Fantastic setting and experience,5,,My wife and I visited the Flower and Cloud Domes but we didn't have time to visit the whole gardens. I would say that you would need to put aside a day for this. The setting near Marina Bay Sands hotel is fantastic and the plants and experience was incredible especially the waterfall in the Cloud Dome. Thoroughly recommend it!!,,
,,Amazing,5,,"I am still gob smacked at the originality and vision of this fantastic creation. Yes, they are gardens, but the structures are totally unique in design. They are apparently environmentally friendly too with solar panels and water recycling. The music show with the lighting at night is cool.
(conservatories and cloud walk are not free, but gardens are)",,
,,Nighttime spectacular,5,,We visited only at night for their free show. Was truly worth seeing. It can get crowded so try and arrive half an hour beforehand,,
,,Very pretty at night,5,,This is my 3rd in this place. It is so pretty at night and you can also walk on the bridge with some entrance fee. I didn鈥檛 go up to the bridge and the restaurant. There is also a very nice restaurant on one of the tower. Very nice place,,
,,Best viewed at nighttime,5,,"This area is easily accessible via marina bay sands hotel or via the MRT. You can visit in the day, which is fine for the two big dome鈥檚, however this place was really designed so you can watch the sound and like show at nighttime. Normally around 7pm or 8pm and run twice, but check their website or ur hotel for the leanest time as it changes due to sunset time.",,
,,Beautiful!,5,,"A must do while visiting Singapore, just amazing to walk around and take in the lovely gardens, well maintained. Would visit again.",,
,,Amazing - Must visit,5,,"Gardens by the bay is fantastic attraction, super trees, domes, kids garden are all amazing and definitely worth staying for the light show in the evening.",,
,,Good for garden lovers,4,,We enjoyed the Gardens by the Bay as a low-key family activity to do on a sweltering hot Singapore day (the garden domes are chilled which makes a welcome respite from the heat). My kids were probably more interested in hiring the electric scooters that we saw other fams enjoying around that area... but still enjoyed the gardens.,,
,,My second time to visit garden by the bay,4,,"My second time to visit here, still amaze on this place. I loved so much and my 2years old girl are very happy here.",,
,,A reason for Garden lovers to go to Singapore,5,,"Gardens by the bay is a destination not just an attraction. It is worth going to Singapore just to go to the gardens. Although the big enclosed domes are the highlight the surrounding, mostly tropical, gardens show the diversity of trees, palms and plants in a magnificent setting.
The flower dome has a huge array of plants, mostly in flower, from all over the world and is set out in countries and regions. The cloud rain forest dome is a little more specific as most of the plants are from higher altitude, cooler tropical area and has numerous more ""indoor"" types of plants. A large diverse array of orchards adds much of the colour in there along with gesneriads and other exotica.
There are flash more expensive places to eat but my preference is the food market area near the children's playground - satay is great.
If your love plants, plan on seeing this over two days.
A must see in Singapore.",,
,,Singapore'most amazing Botanical garden behind Marina Bay Sands,5,,What an amazing Botanical garden! The visit is free of charge and you can stroll through many beautiful lanes an theme areas. Only the 2 indoor gardens cost an entrance fee and the sky walk. Attention there is always quite a line up for the Skywalk and you will have to calculate with at least 30 min. waiting time. The light and sound shows at 8 and 9 pm are breathtaking and touching with opera music and again free of charge.,,
,,Oasis in the middle of city,5,,A nice walk far from the noise of the city. A walk between the trees is to be advised although it turns out to be shorter than it seems. We didn't visit the conservatories.,,
,,A must see,4,,"Gardens by the Bay can be reached by the Hop on/off bus tours on the Green line. As we visited during the daytime we initially took the tourist shuttle around the outskirts of the property which although had a small cost, was well worth the extra as the audio explained the meaning and history of each section of plantings and we would have missed this portion of the gardens had we not taken the shuttle. Once back at the entrance area we then paid for entry to the flower Dome and cloud forest with walkway. Both beautiful structures and plantings however visiting them it is a mission to get past the huge number of selfie stick users. This could do with monitoring by the Gardens as its the worst have ever come across as a tourist. However the venue itself is certainly well worth a visit day and night.",,
,,A must visit!,5,,"Buy tickets ahead of time for the dones, since the line can be insane, and take the 'super tree' catwalk. The view of the city is worth it!",,
,,New landmark in Singapore,5,,"Very large greenhouse and beautiful, you have to spend one day at this location. The atmosphere is full of nature live.",,
,,Loved the Cloud Forest,4,,"Under the domes is the Cloud Forest on one side with sky walkways and it was full of orchids. Beautiful. The other side was a bit of a letdown I felt. Outside is undeniably beautiful, but it is so hot in June we didn't want to do that much outdoors!",,
,,Fantastic Visit,5,,It is a real botanical garden which is worth a visit both during day time as well as night time. There is nothing really spectacular about it other than the fact that your soul gets a lot calmer in this green garden and at night with the soothing lights that calms you down. Just go there to relax and regain energy.,,
,,Must-see part of Singapore,5,,"I feel that this park is a must-do. It's really nice, well kept and clean, and entry is also free, with lots to see. You have to pay to go into the two large greenhouses (Cloud Forest and Flower Dome), but really, it's well worth it - super displays in the Flower Dome especially. Also you can walk around the supertrees for free, but you have to pay to go up to the high-level platform at Supertree Grove (again well worth it for the views). The trees light up after dark, and there's also a music/light show based on these trees - don't miss !",,
,,A must seee if you are visiting Singapore,5,,"Great place to visit, the kids loved it as much as the adults. Lying under the stars watching the light and music show was a highlight and the water park was a welcome cool down on a ridiculously hot day",,
,,Wow!,5,,Free light show a must for all! Fantastic easy to access and lots to see! Gift shop closes after light show so go before hand!,,
,,Spectacular,5,,"Visited GB in the evening, just in time for the night light display at the the Super Tree. The theme on my visit was 'Opera Night'. The light accompanied by the operas was so good. Dazzling display like fireworks surrounding you. Visitors were just comfortably sitting or lying on the ground enjoying the night cool breeze and romantic music under the simmering sparkling lights.",,
,,The waterfall is so amazing!!,5,,"I visited gardens by the bay with my family and my nieces. They love the cloud forest dome, we didn鈥檛 have time to visit the flower dome because we鈥檙e so amaze with the cloud forest view. After we enjoyed the garden rhapsody. So beautiful!",,
,,"An Artificial Central Park of Singapore which is Friendly, Nice, Safe and a walk in the park",4,,"It's a huge park in the city by Singapore standard. I would recommend to come in the later evening when the weather is starting to cool off from the hot humid climate of Singapore if you are not from the region. There are two Dome parks to check it out and also the man-made wonder - Super Trees around the Gardens by the bay. Perfect for family outings, couples as well as lone rangers who like to seek solitude immersing in the park. There are a few cafes and the park can be accessed easily by the public transport mainly the MRT Bayfront stop and also close to the infamous Marina Bay Sands Hotel. There are also free lighting shows at night so do check out the schedule with the sometimes friendly depending on the mood of the information staff. I would also recommend for joggers to explore with their light foot as well as couples having a splashing time dining at the Super tree with no advertising fees from the Indochine group. Enjoy.",,
,,Best Place in Singapore,5,,This is a must visit place when you are in Singapore. Very beautiful and peaceful. At the evening you shoud stay for a Super tree grove lights and music show. It is very impressive!!,,
,,Beautiful but boring,3,,This place is beautifully made but nothing much to do. Full Marks to SIngapore for this but I am not much for a Garden Person. Would prefer shopping or a beach,,
,,Great Place to visit,5,,"The structures were great to see. We did the walk across the top of the trees. Also did Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. Flower Dome was ok, Cloud Forest was much better. The waterfall was great. Since it was very humid, both places were great to escape the heat and humidity. We went back at 8:30pm for the light show. That was great to watch.",,
,,Overrated,3,,"Decent views, it's free. Near marina bay sands. Big place, you need to pay to enter specific area...",,
,,Very cool at night,5,,"We wandered over in the evening and did the free stroll through the gardens to see the ""trees,"" which are metal structures covered in plants that are covering them over. They change colors and are spectacular to look at. We didn't pay to go on the tree walkways. I'd like to go back and see more of the gardens during the day.",,
,,Great Gardens,5,,"We went here three years ago and were thrilled. Back again and it's just as impressive and thrilling. Truly a great set of gardens and the two ""greenhouse' (understatement) are a real thrill to walk round, especially the Cloud Forest with all its orchids and other exotic plants,
All the outside gardens have matured and the Skywalk has been added since our last visit - and the Skywalk is an extra treat to be enjoyed.
Great Gardens - a must see in our view for anyone who is a plant/ garden lover. Well laid, beautifully kept and with first class facilities.
Expensive - but it is worth it; this is a first call, super excellent place to visit.",,
,,Garden built on reclaimed land,5,,"The garden is free for everyone, there are supertrees with light shows twice a day, lots of green and two domes with tropical forest and flowers inside. Views are amazing.",,
,,Skyway is the most beautiful Garden,4,,Cloud forest and Flower Dome are the first point all visitors choose to go. Ticket price at the counter: Adult: 28SGD. Travel time can be from 1 to 4 hours because Garden by the bay quite wide.,,
,,ok,3,,"nice to walk around the flowers and gardens, also temperature is good! t is ok and a nice place to visit but not cheap!",,
,,"OMG, it's awesome and so is the air-con!",5,,"Singapore is humid and hot 365 days a year (just in case you weren't aware) and air-conditioning anywhere is an absolute blessing. We took a taxi from our city hotel for $12 and arrived 20mins later at the front entrance. Bought a combined Cloud Walk and Flower Walk ticket and were absolutely blown away by the beauty, adventurous looking skybridge and the special Orchid Exhibition, which I think runs til mid August 2018, the friendliness of staff, the cleanliness and spectacular 360degree views of...well, absolutely everything. We went mid afternoon and were sorry to not be able to see the lightshow at night, but, even if you only have a few hours between flights, this is definitely the place to see.",,
,,Beautiful gardens to explore,5,,"We spent 3 hours exploring the Cloud forest, Flower dome and the Supertree grove. We saw all in daylight but then stayed for the light show which was magical. It was fantastic listening to wonderful opera while the super trees were lit up in all varying colours of the rainbow. Well worth a visit.",,
,,A magnificent place for young and old,5,,The nightly show is great - make sure you're in a good spot well before it starts because it can get crowded. The cloud forest is amazing and don't be put off by queues - they move fairly fast. Allocate yourself a few hours to wander through both glasshouses - we went at 6pm (latest entry is 8) and just made it to the light and sound show.,,
,,"Amazing creation, although hard to compete with other green houses like Kew Gardens for example. N",4,,"Amazing creation, although hard to compete with other world famous green houses like Kew Gardens for example. Nonetheless, the green house and the cloud forest are architectural and engineering wonders. We also really appreciated the environmental message passed on to the many visitors coming from a great variety of horizons. We truly enjoyed walking through the surrounding park and were lucky to spot some special birds and a swimming monitor lizard. We are truly delighted we waited for the sun to set to enjoy the light show from the suspended bridge linking the metal tree structures! Would not have wanted to miss this. We finished the evening at the bar of the Marina Bay Sands hotel from where we took more pictures of the Garden by the Bay.",,
,,Captivating displays and plenty to explore,5,,"My family visited the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome, as well as eating in one of the cafes, on a hot and humid July day. As well as the domes providing a great respite they were magical to visit for the amazing displays and the views presented high up in the domes.",,
,,Great Day Out!,5,,"Visited recently. Spent all day here and for our family the Flower Dome is a highlight. Don't underestimate how much time you'll need exploring the gardens, both indoors and outdoors. Remember to stay for the light show!",,
,,Nice for a quiet afternoon,5,,"A great place to take a walk and relax. You'll also find some great food at Satay on the Bay, which is quite a nice hawker centre here.",,
,,Awesome,4,,It was our first visit to the gardens and we found it a great tourist attraction. The gardens are nicely laid out and areas are properly marked.,,
,,Flowers,5,,"These gardens are amazing, absolutely a must see when visiting Singapore, every imaginable colour and easy to access.",,
,,Blooming great time,5,,"This is a fantastic place to visit. We arrived at around 6.30pm and spent around an hour walking through the Cloud Forest dome. It is amazing how this is built and the displays are fabulous. We timed our visit for early evening because we also wanted to see the display under night lights, which makes them look even more amazing. Highly recommend you visit this.",,
,,Enjoyable,4,,Unusual and interesting but can become congested for the Rhapsody in the evening All in all a pleasant experience,,
,,a must visit in Singapore,5,,The gardens is a must visit part of Singapore. The two domes are excellent displays and the views to the city are amazing. The domes can be busy but not too crowded that you can't move around easily.,,
,,Amazing Place!,5,,You can spend the whole day in this area. Day time just enjoy the Gardens. Beautiful flower garden a nd Cloud Forest is amazing. It is like something out of this world. It is for whole family. Ticket prices are around $20 so not expensive. Night time enjoy a magical light and sound show in the garden.,,
,,Wonderful Experience,4,,The Gardens by the Bay is an amazing attraction and a must see for visitors to Singapore. You could spend days walking around this area viewing the many different zones but well worth at least half day wander.,,
,,AT THE END OF DAY - ANOTHER GARDEN,3,,"We were not overly impressed with this place. It is a giant indoor garden which, although pretty, didn't have anything special going for it other than size. It is located in the park right across the street from the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. if you have extra time, stop by, but I wouldn't go out of my way.",,
,,Magical place!,5,,"Gardens by the Bay consist of different areas to visit and see. The park itself is very impressive with the SuperTree Groves. There's also two different conservatories, the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. Both you would have to purchase tickets to enter. The park is free with a light show at night. You must visit if you're in Singapore.",,
,,Very nice but with a not,4,,"Amazing gardens. The Light show ... lovely !!!! It's a very nice place in Singapore. Try to take your time to profite of this gardens. Such beautiful. But with a ""not"".
In fact, the Cloud Forest was my deception. Ok it's fun if you see this like only an attraction. If you go in Singapour and in Malaisia, you can go in the jungle. So the cloud forest .... but the architecture ... yes. The other building for the flowers is more interesting.",,
,,Very beautiful,4,,Very beautiful garden to walk and to enjoy your self and play with your kids. You can bring your kids to play at the splashing zone.,,
,,Great gardens,5,,A fantastic must see. Deals with the large crowds very well. Well worth seeing for such a great display of orchids and other native vegetation.,,
,,A must in Singapore - such beauty,5,,"A lovely place to spend a few hours relaxing and taking photos of beautiful flowers, and shrubs. We started at the Cloud Forest, which was a surprise at every turn. A lot of thought has gone into this, and we were overwhelmed. Then we did the Flower Dome, and enjoyed seeing flowers from around the world, including many of my favourite such as begonia and hygrangea. The skyway was good also, and we did imagine just how beautiful this could be at night time. Also a clean and tidy place.",,
,,Spectacle Light Show,5,,Nice to visit at night around sunset to view the light show and then the Marina Bay Sands' light show follows after here.,,
,,Must see in Singapore!,5,,"If you are in Singapore and you haven鈥檛 been to the Gardens by the Bay, stop everything and GO NOW! Not only are these gardens documented on many travel channels, but they are even a part of the Planet Earth series.
The super trees, which are one of the biggest draws of the space, are among the most magical sights I鈥檝e seen in my life.
I鈥檇 suggest setting aside a few hours and going around sunset so you are able to experience the gardens during the daylight and also when the trees are lit up at nighttime. Enjoy all of the different orchids and spend some time walking through the cloud forest.
You will not regret this experience.",,
,,Never ending beauty,5,,"The garden is what you expected it to be. Too many wonderful flowers, plants and collections of crystals.",,
,,Worth going,4,,A lot of beautiful plants! Remember to bring your camera. It鈥檚 like a plant gallery to me than garden. A place that combine art and plants.,,
,,Surprisingly interesting for teenagers,5,,"Everyone says it鈥檚 s must do???

What I was really surprised by was how much the teenage kids loved it.

Great photo opportunities for them, the cloud walkway although scary was also a highlight.

At the same time they also experienced and learnt some botanical concepts and the environmental messaging was great.",,
,,A must visit,5,,Set out on 3 kilometers of reclaimed land it is really good and free. There is a free 10 minute light show in the evening too,,
,,"Amazing, beautiful gardens. Great kids area.",5,,"Such a great way to spend the day, walking around the beautiful gardens. My son played in the kids garden. Take swimming stuff. We then watched the light show towards the end of the day.",,
,,Wonderful venue,5,,"The Gardens by the Bay are just fantastic. We went in the afternoon and visited the Flower Dome. There was a begonia festival which was breathtaking. Walking around the gardens is very relaxing, and there are other attractions (unfortunately the Skywalk was closed due to the weather). We went back in the evening for the light show in the Supertree Grove. It was quite spectacular. The whole experience is not to be missed!",,
,,"Amazing , super, peaceful, don鈥檛 miss it",5,,"Amazing , super, peaceful, don鈥檛 miss it... Wonderful, green gardens and so peaceful ! Go in evening and visit domes first !! Flower dome was heavenly and cloud forest was magnificent!! You would be amazed by such an experience We absolutely loved it !! Go in evening , around 4 , do the domes and then do the outside and watch the Super tree show We we鈥檙e so glad that we bought tickets from Klook as it was bit crowded and saved our time!",,
,,Lovely Gardens!,4,,"Gardens by the bay is a lovely place to stroll around, there are many themed gardens to enjoy, though, in my opinion, they are all very similar. The supertrees are absolutely spectacular and satay by the bay is positively humungous!",,
,,one can stay at marina bay and enjoy gardens by the bay and supertree grove and singapore eye,5,,any body who stays at marina bay has a view of these three things from the hotel and are really near by,,
,,Amazing!,4,,"For something so original and out there this is an amazing place! The gardens are out of this world with a bizarre range of plants, great art and wonderful architecture. Even with a 10yo and 7yo they were captivated the entire time. My only complaint would be the number of people but I guess you can鈥檛 stop that!",,
,,Spectacular light show,5,,"We went to watch the light show at 8pm. It was amazing. Similar to what we have seen at Epcot, with music. Can't believe it was free!",,
,,Don't miss the light/sound show at night,5,,The whole place is well worth a visit but the light show is the outstanding highlight. Best to go in the mid to late afternoon and finish with the show.,,
,,A fantastic attraction,5,,A wonderful day and evening spent wandering around the expansive gardens and under cover exhibitions . The evening light show is wonderful and it is a great place to take children .,,
,,A must see,5,,"Could easily spend multiple days here. All gardens are well maintained with information provided explaining the plants. The small themed gardens are free and are worth wandering around. The domes are ticketed but are definitely worth going in to. They are air conditioned so offer a nice break from the humidity. You can choose to go to one or both domes. The SkyWalk (ticketed) offers a view of the city and the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. However, you can only spend 15 minutes on the SkyWalk. There is a free light show set to music each evening for approximately 15 minutes, in which the Super Trees light up in time to the music.",,
,,Very nice but too crowded,4,,Lovely visit to the garden by the bay. Very interesting garden.Try not to go over the weekend in the evenings as the crowd is chaotic and taxi lines unending. The walk to the MRT is killing!,,
,,Beautiful and air-conditioned,5,,"We loved the flower dome because it had plants from lot of different regions and the sculptures of animals out of wood was amazing especially the dragon. We went into the cloud dome as well which was a nice experience because it had a water fall and it felt like you where in a rainforest (apart from the temperature). I would not recommend walking on the elevated bridge down from the mountain if you are afraid of heights.
Awesome for families and a great experience.",,
,,Magnicent!,5,,"What a stunning addition to the tourism offering in Singapore! The gardens are immense, and the Supertrees are quite fascinating. The Skyway walk is well worth it.
The two domes are a pleasant escape on a hot day, and the Cloud Forest reminded me of my first visit to Disney's Epcot - a fascinating and educational experience.
We also went to the light show at night - all in all a wonderful experience.",,
,,Night walkers...,5,,"After checking in to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel which had a view over the gardens and beyond, we decided on a walk around early evening.

Unfortunately we missed the show and the admission into some of the other attractions like the rooftop walk but nonetheless it was well worth the visit and is spectacular lit up at night.

Not disappointed despite the majority of attractions closing at 8pm.",,
,,Wow! Must visit,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is not something you will find elsewhere. It's man made but yet natural. I really like this place, calm, serene and to be surrounded with all the greens and variety of flora amazes me. Definitely a must visit and a place I will go again. Young children may not appreciate it as much but they will love the water play area! So bring along swimsuit. It's definitely a place the entire family will enjoy.",,
,,Beautiful concept and amazing light show at night,5,,"I only went here once and by night but it was such a magical experience. The trees were lit in a beautiful blue light. Even if these are man made, they make you realize how incredible trees are.",,
,,Magnificent Garden,5,,"I have visited this place together with my two sisters and niece first week of this month, If you are a garden lover, this place is for you.I love the awesome man-made waterfalls that makes the place a little bit cooler. Perfect to enjoy the beauty of nature. Singapore is a warm country the whole year round because it's too close to the line of the equator and you'll tell that those green plants will not survive but they do because of proper care and well maintained temperature suited for those kind of plants. The people who take care of the place, you are perfectly doing a great job.",,
,,Amazing,5,,Highly recommend Gardens by the Bay. Flower and Cloud domes are spectacular. You must stay for the lights show at 8:30pm for 15mins. Very mesmerising.,,
,,Outstanding tourist location must see and highly recommended,5,,"Two paid scenic gardens that was sd $28 per person and worth every cent.
Exquisite gardens, cool rainforest environment with easy walk but bring comfortable walking shoes as location is huge.
Respect to Singapore planning and development to support creation of this eco friendly tourism venue. It鈥檚 a clear tourist winner which is good for the envrt and educational",,
,,Good break from the Concrete and Roads,4,,"With Gardens by the Bay having two domes - Cloud Forest and Flower Dome, it does give a respite from the Concrete and heat and humidity. Super tree concept is nice, and also the Skywalk. There is a light and music show at night. There are wide Gardens outside the domes, but during a hot day not many people were around. Cloud Forest is OK, if one has been to other Botanical gardens, though it's curated well and has many species and veers towards environmentalism and conservation, sometimes being preachy. The highlight was the Flower Dome where the Orchid Extravaganza was on display- it was a riot of colors and different shapes of the Orchids. I also managed to get a free guided tour inside, lucky to be there at the time tour was starting. Gardens by the Bay are worth a visit when in Singapore.",,
,,Amazing,5,,"I love this place ! We went to the night light show which was free. Lasted 15 minutes, set to music and was spectacular. As we were walking across the bridge into the gardens there was a fly by of aircraft and helicopters (no idea why) but it was amazing- right place at the right time - just added to our enjoyment. Haven't done any of the domes- perhaps next time.",,
,,Lovely,5,,Lovely garden! We went on the buggy tour as it was too hot to walk around. Very well maintained. We loved it. Nice children play area.,,
,,Best tourist venue ever,5,,"We enjoyed a full day at the Gardens by the Bay. Amazing display at the flower dome, spectacular display in the cloud forest dome and the sky walk was terrific. This whole park if spectular. Can highly recommend to anyone visiting Singapore. We did some of the visit during the day and came back to see the evening lights both great.",,
,,Fabulous,5,,This is a definite to do when in Singapore. We went to the cloud dome and spent about two hours photographing everything. It is amazing. So many beautiful flowers and plants. Catch the shuttle if it is really hot.,,
,,Truly amazing,5,,"It was a very pleasant visit, very cool inside surroundings with all kind of plants. You just feel so relax after that.",,
,,Flower Dome & Cloud Forest,4,,"We visit nearly afternoon, enter Flower Dome & Cloud Forest. It was long queue, so they over us to take stair, & i guess it nearly broke my knee. But we love it. Unfortunately we're in hury so it's only short time visit.",,
,,Best tourist attraction in Singapore,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is beautiful- it is a must-see of you go to Singapore, The cloud forest is the best part- but aim to be there when they are misting (which is every 2 hours) which makes it even better. Try not to go on a weekend night to see the light show as it soooooo busy.",,
,,Fantastic gardens,4,,"Up on the walk way the breeze offers some relief from the heat. The platform does move and shake as people move around, this may make some people a little uneasy. The views are great looking back towards Marina Bay.",,
,,A must do,5,,"Great design, great views. The cloud forest dome is excellent, and is air conditioned for a break from the heat.",,
,,Beautiful dome,4,,"I went on a Monday morning. One of the cimb was under 鈥渃onstruction鈥? so I could not visit. So best to check if the place is doing plants replacement to avoid disappointment.

The best time to visit the domes are when there are seasonal flowers then you will get to take more beautiful pictures.",,
,,Amazing!!!,5,,One of my favourite spots in Singapore. Impossible not to go! All details are perfect and the atmosphere is amazing,,
,,Beautiful Garden with Flowers from all around the world,5,,Beautiful Garden with Flowers from all around the world. Garden by the bay located close to Marina bay sands hotel and Singapore flyer. Lovely Garden. it will take 3-4 hours to visit full garden. you can take ride by paying SGD8/-. There is light show around 7.45pm......wonderful show......Must visit place in Singapore,,
,,Absolutely amazing!,5,,"The gardens cannot be described in words, they are truly amazing!

We got the metro to bay front and there are clear signs when coming out of the metro where you need to go. The gardens are very nice and look amazing! Great photo opportunities, we walked round the whole garden, ate at satay by the bay and it is very cheap! (This is coming from a student) And lots of different choices.

We didn鈥檛 go in the conservatories but the price was about 24 (roughly 拢13) so we left it. We walked to marina bay sands and went up there instead which gives great views over Singapore.",,
,,Worth visiting,4,,It's a nice place to visit atleast once if you are in Singapore. Plan a day to roam inside worlds largests green glass building. It's worth visiting,,
,,Unique and beautiful,5,,We spent some time walking around the gardens and were so impressed by the level of detail and beauty of the gardens. We stayed for the light show - what a treat!,,
,,the outdoor gardens are beautiful,4,,We paid for the cloud gardens and this was ok but over-priced. The must-do are the outdoor gardens which are stunning especially on a hot night after a long flight,,
,,Unforgettable,5,,"Was in singapore for 4 days for business and went to Gardens by the bay 3 times. Why you ask? Well - it's outstanding, mesmorising and generally out of this world. Firstly the domes are hilariously cheap for something so great. 25 singapore dollars (maybe 拢15) to do both and you can go in and out as many times as you want in the day.

Secondly at night (7:45 and 8:45 (i think)) they light up the trees surrounding it (which is free). When I was there they did it to opera music which was truly amazing.

Top tips

1) Go to this place during the day to explore the domes
2) Go back at night and do the domes again as they are different under darkness
3) Go to the lightshow (it's free)
4) Walk from the gardens to marina bay sands and walk through the hotel (it's a nice walk and the hotel is amazing).",,
,,Great experience,4,,"we had a great time, the place is huge, we sent a couple of good hours, looking at both dooms & with many great things to look at, we were amazed at what they had done with the plants",,
,,Brilliant ?,5,,"Great attraction. We walked there from the Marina Bay Sands hotel and explored around the ""trees"" before heading to the Flower Dome followed by the Cloud Forest dome. They are both amazing but definitely do the Flower Dome first because the WOW factor when entering the Cloud dome is memorable. Top tip - go early afternoon (it is hot) & buy the ticket for the sky walk amongst the metal trees first (you can use them later that day & it saves you queing up for the tickets later). Then go to the Flower Dome, then the Cloud dome (they have the misting at 18:00) then do the sky walk at sunset, then find somewhere to sit with a clear view of the central tree & wait until 19:45 for the epic sound & light show !!! There is another show at 20:45.",,
,,Beautiful venue,5,,I visited Garden by the bay with my family and we were amazed at the beautiful greenery. There is an observation tower with wire bridges at the center of the venue and it is a must see for anyone who wants to see the entire singapore island from a birds eye view. I highly recommend Gardens by the bay for anyone looking for a very different experience,,
,,Absolutely brilliant displays,5,,"An unexpected highlight of our trip to Singapore was our time spent meandering around the Gardens by the Bay. We spent a long time going through the Flower Dome and eventually did the Skywalk. Earlier in the day there had been a potential for lightning strike so the walk was closed but it opened up while we were engrossed in the Flower Dome.

The variety and scale of the displays were awe inspiring. The accompanying sculptures and interpretive displays were very complementary. If you enjoy nature, have an interest in beauty and nature then this is the place for you.

Unfortunately we were unable to visit the Cloud Forest as it was closed for maintenance when we were there. Definitely next time!

One last thing - tucked away in the Flower Dome is a little caf茅. If you are fortunate enough to get a table in here try the Strawberry Mousse Cake. It's scrumptious.",,
,,Cloud dome is a winner.,5,,Visited both domes and the flower dome was nice with gardens from all the continents. But the cloud dome was better. Just going to the top and slowly winding down past all the vegetation was lovely. Be thre for a misting session.,,
,,Plenty too see for free but a visit to the Cloud Forest is a must,5,,Gardens by the Bay is a must see in Singapore and we decided to do both gardens. The Cloud Forest was definitely our favourite and a great reprieve from the Singapore Heat. There is also plenty to see without having to go into one of the paid gardens and I would definitely stay for the light show that lights up the Supergrove Trees. If you want to go up into the Supergrove trees do note the opening times. We were too late for the last entry.,,
,,Always looking good,4,,"The core Gardens by the Bay area near the 2 domes is an attractive exercise in landscaping. Although it's a bit hot during the day, it's still worth taking the time to walk around and admire the beauty of the plants and the water features. The main highlight is of course the 2 domes, but you'll have to pay to go inside. Note that the gardens on the east side of the river are not quite so pleasant at the moment because of all the mrt construction work taking place.",,
,,Fabulous and iconic,5,,I haven鈥檛 been to Singapore for 10 years and and was pleasantly amazed when I returned with my family for a stop off. The gardens by the bay are amazing and really come to life at 7:45pm when the light show commences. We saw it accompanied by Opera music . Truly magical,,
,,Beautiful,5,,"The best time of the day is to go late afternoon, it is beautiful to walk through the different themes and then bxring you into the best position for the evening light show. This is trully spectacular",,
,,Not Just Conservatories and Supertree Grove,5,,"The gardens by the bay are famous for the conservatories (flower dome and cloud forest) and super trees. But besides these there are other parts like Indian garden, Chinese garden, floral clock, dragonfly island, world of palms and so on. Along with these small gardens there are also educational exhibitions showing how plants have evolved, types of plants, life of trees etc.

One could easily spend an entire day visiting different parts of the gardens. There are several restaurants and cafes in the garden. Also ample of places for children to play. At night the gardens take a different avatar when the lights come on.",,
,,Don't go too early in the afternoon,4,,"This a brilliant light show but is best experienced just as it gets dark. So you need to time your arrival right otherwise you'll be hanging around for ages waiting for it to start with very little to do.
Going up and along the walkway offers a very good view point but the staff try to keep you moving along so, again, time it right so that you see some of the light show.",,
,,Stunning,5,,Worth going . Beautiful surroundings amazing views and stunning displays. Very busy with school trips,,
,,Beautiful at night!,5,,"The show at the gardens at night (19:30 & 20:30) are absolutely beautiful! Lay on the ground, as the rest does, and look at the beautiful displays of lights combined with classical music! At daytime the domes are impressive, the rest of the park not so much.",,
,,Wow! Incredible gardens,5,,"We ended up only having 2 days in Singapore due to flights being disrupted, so had to reduce our list of places to see - we're so glad that the Gardens by the Bay stayed on there!

We walked here from our hotel fairly early in the morning to try to avoid the heat, but even so we were so glad to get into the domes as they were so much cooler than outside!

There were no queues for entrance tickets when we were there, but you can buy tickets online to avoid long queues at peak times.
We went to the Cloud Forest first, which was just incredible. We then headed to the Flower Dome, which was still very impressive but didn't have the same wow factor.

The grounds are amazing, with so much green space and a huge variety of different gardens. It perfectly reflects the mixed cultural heritage of Singapore.

This is a must do!",,
,,Amazing!,5,,"These Gardens are incredible, amongst the most beautiful in the world. You can spend an entire day here. The two massive indoor gardens are air conditioned and a wonderful escape form the Singaporean humidity.",,
,,A Futuristic Garden,4,,A futuristic garden in the bay area of Singapore.It鈥檚 a good place to spend with your children.The price is somewhat expensive.,,
,,Cloud Forest and Flower Dome,5,,If you are saving money then skip the Flower and just do the Cloud Forest. Buy tickets online before hand at a discount and redeem queue is quicker. Very efficient exhibit flow and an amazing feet of architecture and landscaping. Beautiful waterfall and misting time. Disability and pram friendly too.,,
,,"Great walk, right in the heart of Singapore",5,,"A lot of people think that you need to pay to come here - you don鈥檛. Only the two domes and the treetops are paid.

From the casino or train station the walk is lovely and you can get into the dome area in under 15 mins. On the other side you can continue walking to the east coast or take a left back to MBS. It鈥檚 a lovely walk with great manicured greenery",,
,,Must visit,5,,"This is a very recent development in Singapore showing off the bay area. The ambiance is nice, especially if you're traveling with family. There's an area for cycling and running, if you're into those things. Definitely spend a leisurely evening here.",,
,,Simply Amazing,5,,"Beutifully designed structures and amazing collection of flowers and plants from all over the world...never knew there was something called a ""Bottle Tree"" in Australia",,
,,Best thing to see in Singapore,5,,"Hats off to the master minds who have built ""Gardens By the Bay"". Must visit place in Singapore. Although i visited this place in the morning and liked it very much but i have heard that during evening, the place look more beautiful.",,
,,Gardens with air conditioning,4,,"Air-conditioned gardens, enjoy the man-made nature in a country that destroyed it for development and rebuild it for recreational purpose.",,
,,The beautiful big garden,5,,"It is a very beautiful garden but if it rains I couldn't get through the garden but walk in the covered area instead. If you want to entry in some gardens, you have to pay a few $. My tips would be don't pay extra costs beside the entry cost on the main garden because you will spend almost a day just to get around the garden.",,
,,Buy tickets beforehand,4,,"We stumbled upon an opportunity to buy slightly discounted tickets beforehand at the Chinatown Visitor Centre, which turned out to be a great idea, as the lines at ticketing were very long. Our favorite part was definitely the Cloud Forest. When we were there, it was too hot, so we didn't really explore the outside part (which was free admission), although we did walk through it to get to the light show (outside the shopping mall). In all, it was a fun but tiring experience. I would definitely recommend some really comfortable walking shoes, as it seems like every place to sit down is already occupied. If you're into photography, this is a great place to have a photo-op and take some gorgeous photos.",,
,,An incredible nighttime experience,5,,"Wow! This is like nothing I've ever seen before. In daylight it's fascinating and lots to see, but at night, the 19.45 and 20.45 music and light show is spectacular. The trees come alive with lights to the music from La Boheme, Tosca and Carmen. A unique experience!",,
,,Think of Roses in a silent place,5,,"This is a nice place, when i was there it was at the evening the it was nice and cool. we been there with our family. Th Garden was nice and well arranged. i liked the place.",,
,,morning walk,4,,"This are very interesting and have lots to see, the all family enjoyed it, a good way to spend a morning or the all day depending how thoroughly one wants to be.",,
,,Came for a visit,5,,"This is by far the best futuristic garden the world has ever seen.

Everything is so technologically grown and the arrangements of flowers/plants is simply amazing and breathtaking.

The only thing that I would give a negative comment is that if a person who has altophobia, the walk down the aisle might not suit you (I have altophobia).",,
,,Very Unusual,5,,It is one of the most amazing garden one can see. It is very well structured and well maintained. There are so many varieties of plants and trees and the way they have been exhibited is truly surprising.,,
,,Well worth a visit,4,,Excellent mixture of plants and man made structures. Very good arrangement of examples from different areas. Plants I am used to seeing indoors outside in their natural environment.,,
,,This place is awesome!,5,,"So many different species of flora and fauna, it is huge and awesome at the same time. Do plan to spend at least 3 hours to do complete justice to this garden. And the architecture is out of this world!",,
,,Amazing place,4,,Allow enough time to thoroughly walk around this place - you need at least 2 hours and expect to see a lot of people.,,
,,Great experience,5,,"This is an excellent day out and worth doing on a visit to Singapore. If you do all the attractions (Supertree Grove, OCBC Skyway and the domes - Forest and Cloud) it is an expensive outing but a worthwhile one.

The Supertree Grove has lots of useful information about the trees and how they contribute to environmentally sustainable functions while the skywalk provides good views of Singapore, the gardens and the Marina Bay area.

A short walk from the Supertree Grove are the two domes; both very different. The Flower Dome has gardens from different parts of the world and is kept interesting by wonderful life size carvings of animals made out of wood, sculptures, colourful flower beds and interesting themed garden beds. The Cloud Forest is a large mountain like structure that allows you to explore tropical highlands and see plants and ferns from tropical climates. It has the worlds tallest indoor waterfall and you descend down from the top along walkways as you explore the various tropical highlands.",,
,,"Stunning architecture, waterfall is amazing.",4,,"Really enjoyed the Waterfall in the Cloud Forest & OCBC Sky Way in 'Gardens by the Bay'. Stunning architecture and a fantastic job by the engineers who designed and created this beautiful attraction.

The Waterfall was a real highlight of our trip to Singapore. The Sky Way also gave great views over the bay and a unique view of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel.

I wasn't as impressed with the Flower Dome Conservatory, for the admission price we preferred our visit to the Botanical Gardens. The Conservatory itself is a great building, and is visually stunning - but compared to the Sky Way & The Cloud Forest it was a little cramped in terms of people and walk ways. The Botanical Gardens was a much more pleasant experience for seeing the flowers & trees.",,
,,gardens by the bay,5,,"Hello Guys,
Gardens By The Bay Is Best Everybody Knows That But My Advice To You Is You Visit TheGarden By 5Pm So That You Can also Get The Day Lookout And The Light Show Which Happen Around The 8Pm . Must visit if you are in singapore.",,
,,Great place to visit,5,,"Lovely garden by the bay, the name says it all. Nice to walk around and enjoy all the art and architecture.",,
,,Fantastic,4,,"We visited Gardens by the Bay was fantastic!!
It took a couple of hours to go through both conservatory鈥檚.
The tulip displays were wonderful. Coming from Canberra in Australia we have an annual tulip display but it is outdoors and the poor flowers can get a bit beaten up by the weather whereas this display being inside and in a climate controlled environment the flowers were stunning.
We liked how the space was broken down into different parts of the world and some of the sculptures that were made out of the plants were spectacular.
Highly recommend Gardens by the Bay.",,
,,gardens,5,,im not a flowers buy but this was a nice place to go anyways. I have been here twice and loved it. :),,
,,Amazing,5,,The gardens are beautiful. The two dimes are cool and the plants are excellent. The sculpture are creative and it鈥檚 very easy to get around. A must see,,
,,A highlight of the Singaporean holiday,5,,We鈥檙e advised by friends that this was a must to do whilst in Singapore. So glad we did. We spent 6-7 hours here cumulating in a light show whilst listening to opera. Wish that this show had continued longer. We got a taxi back to the hotel. This was 鈥渙rganised 鈥?chaos!,,
,,Amazing Attraction,5,,The cloud forest was awesome and the supertree grove had an excellent light show for around 15minutes. Definitely worth going to and spending an afternoon/evening there.,,
,,Well Worth a Visit,4,,"Two beautiful domes to visit, both air conditioned and full of wonderful plants and flowers as well as a huge indoor waterfall. You can get to the top of the waterfall and see all the mountain plants. Lots to see, we were there for 2 or 3 hours.",,
,,A beautiful feat of engineering,5,,"This an outstanding man-made area. Sustainability is the key here, this over 100 hectare site is somewhere everyone, young or old should visit. It's stunning, attractive and mind blowing. One trip is not enough. The cloud forest is amazing. Well worth the entry fee.",,
,,Best to spend on hot day,5,,You can feel the humidity in Cloud forest like in actual tropical forest. Vegetation collection is surprising in such small area. You can climb to trees level and above. Flower Dome is always cool for entire year like spring season. My favorite is tulips festival.,,
,,Lovely place,5,,We love it. From the landscape to the space to the number of things to see. This is well worth the trip. Please make time to visit this place.,,
,,Beautiful,5,,"This place has many garden inside, entry is free to see all however two major attraction flower dome and cloud forest has tickets for entry. You need good 4 to 5 hours to complete entire space.",,
,,A must do in Singapore!,5,,"I had read and heard a lot about the Gardens by the Bay, but nothing truly does it justice! The gardens are phenomenal!

Make sure that you check to see if both domes are open before you visit. They are periodically closed for maintenance.

Don鈥檛 miss the Skyway in the Supertree Grove. It is def worth the $8to go up and walk in the canopy. The views are gorgeous. Again, check to be sure it is open before you go, as weather and maintenance can close it down.

Also, make time to check out the Gardens that are outside as well. So many things to see! It will take some time to get through it all!",,
,,Paradise for enthusiasts,4,,Very beautiful garden. Although I am not an enthusiast but still it is really worth visiting. A must visit,,
,,Stunning,5,,Absolutely stunning gardens that are beautifully kept and extremely clean. Toilet facilities are provided and it's disabled and buggy friendly. Best to visit during the evening though once it's a little cooler if you have little ones though.,,
,,Gardens by bay visit with xmas village,3,,"Went there for a visit with my family during Xmas season to have a look at the seasonal flowers. Overall quite good. Able to take lots of nice shots. Xmas village is excluded from the main tickets. You need purchase separately. However, I don't find the Xmas village worth your money. Besides some lighting decor and expensive game booth and rides. You don't really find much worth. Better off at the main gardens. Not a place that kids will enjoy much if you are not prepared to pay for some rides.",,
,,Family outing,4,,Great place to visit with family especially with kids and elderly. Nice and relaxing place to take a slow walk and enjoy the beautiful scenery.,,
,,Must see destination,5,,What a beautiful place they were getting ready for the orchid festival staring on the 13th and all the orchids were being planted but did not spoil our visit spent 5 hours wandering around the gardens. Visited the 2 domes but not the sky walk we went in the day but I would recommend going early evening so you get to see the day time and the night time as we missed the lights,,
,,Lovely light show,5,,"We enjoyed the light show, I鈥檇 say it鈥檚 not a highlight of our trip but I think it would be a bit like going to Paris and not checking out the Eiffel Tower. The gardens are lovely though.",,
,,"AMAZING Trip, AWESOME Experience, AMIABLE Staffs",5,,"Had become Garden by the Bay members for about 5-6years, my last review was a negative one (similar to many who had sound their unhappiness over 2016 Christmas arrangement , lucky that poor encounter never happen again)

But thing get improved and system get better at Garden By the Bay now!

Each time visit was an amazing trip! Differ theme over few months and have Awesome Experience each time! Well done for those creative thinking designer, hardworking worker who done all these great job!

Recently renew my membership again, face some problem, but fortunate got quick thinking & Amiable staffs able solve our problems. Thank!

A Country in a Garden, live this vision & impress each and everyone who visit! Take the feedback sincerely to improve and Garden by the Bay will reach next highest level!",,
,,not wow,3,,Only the OCBC skywalk was good. Flower Dome and and the other things was boring. I am not a flower fan. Could be interesting for garden lovers.,,
,,Worth All the Hype!,4,,My Mom was in smiling all the time we were in them. The cooler temperature of both Cloud Forrest and Flower Dome is a relief to the heat of Singapore,,
,,Terrific 鈥楳ust Do鈥?lightshow,5,,"To sit in the Supertree Grove, listen to great music and watch the light show was a great tourist treat. Only in Singapore are such beautiful things free. The city clearly puts a strong emphasis on beauty, well designed gardens and easy public enjoyment of it all. Show lasts about 30 minutes and the kids loved it.",,
,,Really quite interesting,4,,"We enjoyed most of the experience especially the cloud dome.
We also found the evening light and music show to be excellent.
The staff were friendly and helpful and the gardens were full of interesting sculptures and very interesting plants.
This is a credit to Singapore and the people working in it.",,
,,Spectacular - Day and Night,5,,"The Gardens by the Bay really are one of the jewels in the crown of the amazing city of Singapore. Whether you're looking for a free stroll trough the expansive natural gardens or prefer to enter one of the 2 domes featuring incredible structured garden displays, you'll be impressed by the sheer beauty. As the sun sets the gardens really come alive with a colourful light show set to classical music. Well worth waiting around for",,
,,Wonderful walk,5,,"Ah Singapore why are you so good in making your country beautiful? Your parks are so lovely it's so nice to walk around your city. This place is very beautiful even if it's just man-made. It's very well-maintained and looked very, very natural.",,
,,Fabulous,5,,"Just visited here last week with my daughter, we absolutely loved it, so beautiful all the different gardens and flowers not to mention the waterfall. We stayed for the light show which was spectacular. Well worth a visit.",,
,,Lovely bay walk,5,,"Several parts of the gardens are inaccessible for the time being, due to reconstruction, but the rest is stunning. The lovely walk around the bay, the high-end mall with fine dining and designer stores, the spectacular view of the shining skyscrapers - Singapore at its best!",,
,,Light show spectacular,4,,Stay for the night light/music show absolutely spectacular. Get there early as it is very busy. There is lots to see that is free and the walk along the bay is lovely,,
,,Beautiful,5,,"Enjoyed walking and takig pictures. You should try to go both in the day and the night for different photo opportunities. At night, you can enjoy the Gardens by the Bay Rhapsody where you can sit or lay down (on the floor - bring something to lay on to be more comfy).",,
,,Much better than I thought it would be,4,,"I came here on a sort of rainy day and it was also a holiday, so the place was very crowded. I walked from the MRT station and it's a nice walk. I didn't bother with the paid portion of the gardens because it was so crowded. Just getting a ticket would've taken a long time. The gardens and the super trees and everything were really nice. It probably took about 1.5 hours to walk around quickly to see most of the gardens, but I have a feeling there was still so much more to see.",,
,,Worth the visit if time permits,4,,"I really like what they have done with these two gardens.

Both are immaculate in their presentation. The fact they are also air conditioned provided a welcome relief from the Singapore heat.

The Flower Dome was beautiful but a little hard to navigate with a stroller. No such problems with the Cloud Forest which was amazing.

I felt that the prices were a little high for the attraction and that children three and under should be free.

Overall a pleasant afternoon!",,
,,A wonderful place to visit,5,,"You can鈥檛 stop admiring this man made marvel. The place is huge with a variety of plants, trees, flowers, sculptures, souvenir shops, jogging track, kids water play area etc.

The cloud forest and flower done are a must watch but at a few. And you can just stroll around the rest of the garden for free.

Amazing place. My kids and my parents both loved it.",,
,,"Beautiful, a must see experience when in Singapore.",5,,Stunning views and a great day out. My family explored it by day and enjoyed the light show by night. Eat at the Hawker food stalls at Satay by the bay and let the kids run through the water features at the children鈥檚 garden.,,
,,Thank you for everything! 馃槉,4,,"Staff were decent. Never came across rude. Wished operating hours would close a little later as many would like to experience the evening concept. This is our 2nd visit. We purposely came in time for the evening experience. Simply insufficient for one to really enjoy all the beauty without tryna rush through taking pictures, the crowd and still embracing the nature鈥檚 aesthetic details. The super trees set an awesome expectation with vibes like an Avatar movie. Was hoping the domes were even more creatively lit up to set an abstractly super sool ambience. Day experience was superb!",,
,,Well worth the visit,4,,Anyone planning to visit should consider an afternoon visit so that the evening light show is enjoyed completely.,,
,,Amazing experience,4,,"It鈥檚 a cooled conservation, so you dont have to worry to visit here in sunny afternoon. You can educate your children here with plenty flowers, rare plants, supertrees.",,
,,Beautiful but frustrating,3,,"Wow this is seriously spectacular and very worth a visit. The only concern is how busy it is with bus loads of families coming in for the light shows in the evening. The logistics for getting a cab is a nightmare with buses blocking all entry points so no cabs can get close.

Lots of areas for refreshments but doesn鈥檛 cater well for the unbelievable number of ageing people requiring wheelchairs. There are so many interesting areas, hard to take in during one evening, give yourself one night and a day to enjoy properly without being crowded and rushed.

So beautiful though a credit to Singapore",,
,,Worthwhile visit,4,,"Gardens by the Bay is easily accessible as it is in the city adjacent to the Marina Reservoir . The whole complex is well laid out and sign posted The Cloud and Flower Domes which are sea shell shaped greenhouses are interesting for the young and old .
There are a couple of hundred species of plants and flowers in the domes which are air conditioned This offers a cool respite from the heat and humidity .
The steel framed trees are unique and taking the walkway linking the 2 or 3 steel trees is
a worthwhile trip The restaurant at or around the centre of the steel trees offers a good
aerial view of the Gardens . I am not sure of the food served at the restaurant . There are a few restaurants in the complex including a food centre where local food and satay are sold",,
,,Superb experience!,5,,Amazingly beautiful place! Excellent staff and easy to find location. Highly recommend to anyone... Make sure to bring camera as this place offers fantastic photo opportunities,,
,,Beautiful flowers,5,,It is a special an beautifful place. You can walk inside the domes. Outsite in the nigt ther started a ligtshow it was beautiful. This is a great place to take family and friends fo a nice walk and see all this.,,
,,Awesome,5,,"Amazing place to spend a few hours. The flower dome, cloud dome and skywalk are paid entry but there鈥檚 plenty to see for free.",,
,,Beautiful gardens by the bay,4,,Wonderful flower and rainforest domes. The OCBC walkway is awesome. Must visit location for all tourists.,,
,,A great night show,4,,"The Gardens by the Bay is a 鈥渕ust visit鈥?destination in Singapore. There is a night light show (twice a night) that is FREE and is stunning. The light and sound compliment each other and makes the 鈥渢rees鈥?a delight. Three things to note however. The Gardens are a bit out of the way although you are near the iconic Marina Bay Hotel (the one with the 鈥渂oat鈥?on the roof!), so there is a bit is a hike to get there. The MRT makes a bit of a meal of getting to the nearest station and lastly there is the mass of humanity to deal with. Maybe I am getting old but good manners seems to be sadly lacking. But don鈥檛 let that put you off a great FREE (I said that before i think) experience and it will likely pull you back to see the rest of the gardens by day.",,
,,A must-see!,5,,Absolutely beautiful. Highly recommended during your Singapore visit. I would go out of peak hours. Wear comfy shoes,,
,,Beautiful Oasis in the Middle of Bay,5,,"Contrary to recent review from Craig, I beg to disagree it is not hot in the day. The dome is temperature and humidity controlled cooled to 25degrees or less whole day long. It is perfect place to get out of sun but still in the sun light. Of course, for best photo op should always be before sun totally sets anywhere on earth. Anyways, the theme in park change regularly, from Sakura blooming to roses to sunflowers and the grounds are meticulously kept by the hardworking horticulturist. There is wide variety of pictures you can snap and not travel world to see all the various species of flowers on this Earth. It is definitely a great place to literally ""chill"" out, enjoy many flowers in their full blooms and sometimes you can also see persons who came dressed in kimono and cosplay. Highly recommended for the whole family.",,
,,A must-see in Singapore,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is a must-see attraction in Singapore. There are the two paid conservatories: Flower Dome & Cloud Forest. The Flower Field in the flower dome change every 3 months or so. For example, there is Tulips on display during April to May. Cherry blossoms on display in mid-March to early April . During Chinese New Year, there will be Chinese-inspired flowers. During Christmas, it would be the Christmas decorations and flowers. The Super Tree is a sight to be seen at night. It is an awe-inducing Avatar-looking structure. The rest of the gardens is a good place to take an evening walk and just enjoy the greeneries.",,
,,Garden by the bay,5,,Garden by the bay at singapore is a must see place. What a quality product they have produced and type of services and facilities provided are really superb. Great place. With visit.馃榾,,
,,Flowers and more flowers.,5,,Nice cool place. Never see so much beautiful flowers before in my life. And the waterfall is a wonder. Minimum 2 hours required to walk through the flower dome and cloud forest.,,
,,must see place while in singapore,5,,"must see place while in Singapore , recommend everyone . visit during the night awesome view . fantastic photos . Enjoy the place .. capture good photos",,
,,A must visit,5,,Gardens by the Bay is beautifully landscaped and the light music shows at 7.45pm and 8.45pm are a must for every visitor. We went 3 times!! And it's even free. The flower dome and cloud forest are also breathtaking and worth the money spent.,,
,,Too good,5,,"Visited June 2018,one of kind in whole world can spend half a day if want to see each and every thing,",,
,,Always a joy to come here,5,,"I regularly come here with my family for special events and special occasions. It's good to bring visiting friends and relatives too as I am proud that Singapore has such a beautiful garden that I can boast to overseas visitors. The garden itself is free to enter, so those on budget, feel free to browse the Supertrees and don't forget to watch the Garden Rhapsody (light show) every night at 7.45pm and 8.45pm. For those who are willing to spend more, do visit the conservatories. There're two: Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. Both are worth visiting, but if you're tight on budget and can only go for 1, I'd suggest the Cloud Forest as I feel it's more exciting and dynamic compared to Flower Dome. If you're visiting with Elderly persons with wheel chairs, Flower Dome would be better, as it's more levelled and more wheel chair friendly. There's also a free Children's Playground and water play for both young and old. If you have more time, walk to the next stop which is Satay by the Bay for some local food although GBB (Gardens by the Bay) do also have some eateries but not much option.",,
,,Excellent. A must visit attraction.,5,,"You can literally spend all day here.

The outdoor gardens are free, open 5am-2am. The conservatories, the Cloud Forest and Flower dome, are open from 9am-9pm and do have a fee but are well worth it. The conservatories are cooled and indoors so they can be visited regardless of the weather.

The supertree groves is the star-attraction in the outdoor garden and should be visited both in the daytime and at night. There is a skyway that you can pay S$8 to walk along and the supertrees are amazing from both the ground and the skywalk.

At night, the trees are lit up by lights. Try to time it right and visit when free Garden Rhapsody sound and light show is on - 7.45pm, 8.45pm (Daily). If you're lucky, as I was, you can be on the skyway when the show is on and watch it from there.",,
,,Beautiful place,5,,"I would recommend doing two domes and starting with the flower dome. They have a different theme garden every month in the middle and they are beautiful. But then, over at cloud forest, you are greeted by a huge waterfall! Just stunning. Then the views from the top of the dome as you work your way back down to earth are amazing. Highly recommend!",,
,,Very impressive,5,,"For Florist and lover of florist or lover of all flowers, this is real oasis in the city. Place is very cool (both literally and figuratively ). Place is temperature controlled and very beautiful... its very nice to just sit there and relax, be it in the hot sunny day or rainy day...Super !!!",,
,,Fabulous Gardens.,5,,"We have visited these gardens many times since their inception five or six years ago and each time they are more amazing. We took our friends this time and they loved it as much as we did. There is a walk-way from Marina Bay Sands which takes you through the gardens and to the many restaurants before you even get to the two domes and the Super Trees. We visited on a Monday as the weekends tend to be very busy with families and if you wander the gardens, visit the domes and have a coffee or a meal as it gets dark you will be in time for the incredible light show at the Super Trees. Gardens by the Bay is also accessible from the MRT.",,
,,Nice place to walk around,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is a very well designed place to walk around with your family, especially with your kids.",,
,,Not to be missed,5,,Gardens by the bay - an amazing place. Even if you are not really into plants. It is beautiful and should not be missed on your holiday to Singapore.,,
,,Lovely Gardens,5,,Lovely flowers in the cold dome. The ticket q is very long on the weekend so you better get it from the travel agency. I bought my ticket from Sea Wheel in China now it's cheaper than buying at the Garden,,
,,STUNNING,5,,If you are heading to Singapore head here. We walked from our hotel (around 10-15 minute walk) and went in the morning thinking the afternoon will be too hot. However it is very cool in there so you can walk around comfortably and take your time. You can also go in the evening to see the light show which is free,,
,,Impressive indoor garden,5,,"Gardens by the bay is an impressive structure, both indoor and outdoor. The unique futuristic trees outside is irresistible for pictures. The indoor gardens are amazing, and the temperature is much more comfortable than the outside. There are a lot of different kinds of trees and flowers in the domes for more picture taking. We enjoyed our visit there very much.",,
,,It is amazing,5,,It is amazing. We were wondered. It definitely worth its money even if you don't like trees and flowers a lot.,,
,,Stunning gardens,5,,"I was not sure about this garden, as it is recent and ""artificial"", but it is absolutely amazing! the range and presentation of plants in the various climate zones is brilliant, the 2 glasshouses are fantastic (paid entry), while the outside sections (free) are peaceful and easy to wander.",,
,,Good for walking at night / morning,5,,Used the overhead link-bridge from Marina Bay sands to get there from the hotel . More comfortable to walk in the evening or go for a morning run.,,
,,Brian Arnold,5,,This was truly an amazing experience to see all the different plants and natures of around the world.loved it very much I recommend this to everyone who visits Singapore,,
,,Relaxing and Pictureque,5,,"Nice to walk around the Garden by the Bay under the Super Trees. Good spots for photography and nice to walk around in the evening. The views of the Super Trees are nice with the differenr sizes and height. Descrptions of the sustainable practices on recycling the biomass are on the benches, good to have s better understanding of the beautiful structures and good sustainable practices. A good evening walk whisg enjoying tge scenery.",,
,,Viewed from Singapore 360 degree Flyer,5,,The view from Flyer was really nice and all those who saw my posted photos were charmed to see this one.,,
,,Always something new to see!,5,,"We love going to the 2 cooled conservatories of Gardens by the Bay. Our grandchildren love the Cloud Forest Dome with its tall waterfall and exotic tropical plants. The Lost World which is reached by an elevator and a flight of stairs (another elevator for strollers and wheelchairs and elderly) is amazing with its pitcher plants and venus flytraps and other exotic plants. The cloud walk allows a view of the tropical vegetation at different levels and the treetop walk gives a view of the lower level. Give yourself at least an hour if you want to enjoy the walk without rushing. The Flower Dome has sections for plants from different regions like the Australian Garden, South African Garden, etc. However, the most attractive section is the Flower lawn where the display changes every season. Some of the flowers featured were Tulips, Cherry blossoms, chrysanthemums, begonias. Prices for the two domes are higher for foreigners but those who don't want to look at flowers from temperate countries can walk around the Gardens where no fee is charged.",,
,,Must do in Singapore,5,,We took our young girls there early in the morning to beat the crowds and it was peaceful and idyllic. Beautiful gardens with amazing 鈥榯rees鈥? We could have spent hours exploring the gardens.,,
,,Great Garden,5,,My family came here twice and is in awe twice as well. A must visit if you are in Singapore. It is quite cold inside the Flower Dome so bring a long just a thin jacket or cardigan will do especially for the little kids that are not used to cold. Overall experience was great.,,
,,Such a lovely place,5,,"I usually see this place when I'm touring my friends, when doing photography and when I'm just riding my bike from east coast park. Simply one of the best in the world, it's such a wonderful place. The Water, the plants and the domes mix them up and you'll see an awesome place like this!",,
,,AMAZING !!,5,,The whole area is a MUST to visit place in Singapore. Day or night you get different view. The evening tree show was awesome !,,
,,Spectacular Gardens by day and light show at night,5,,We had a lovely day wandering around the gardens.. Each of the domes houses gorgeous displays of plants and flowers... incredible orchid displays.. We returned on dusk to experience the fabulous light display up in the man made trees.. the night we were there Classic Opera was the feature and it absolutely delighted. Laying back underneath the display was truly enjoyable.,,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,"A great place to bring your companion or family for a stroll. Beautiful view during sun set and night time. Famous Satay by the Bay and other nice local food for your selection. On the right hand side of the satay stalls are the local's favourite Marina Barrage where you can fly kites and enjoy awesome view with your friends and loves one. A place for couples, family with young children, teenagers and friends!",,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,"We visited the Gardens durung the afternoon and stayed till the night show. Well worth the visit to see them at night..Lucky we went early to get a spot as there was thousands of people there as it got dark..
Then after ot finished, the line up to get a taxi was enormous, but in Singapore style it was very well organised and didn't take too long to get taxi..Beware of hawkers...
A definite must see while in Singapore.",,
,,Could this be the Garden of Eden?,5,,"A wonderful magical tour. A huge variety of plants, very well maintained and a refreshing experience as every once in awhile you can be in a vapour shower!",,
,,Amazing !,5,,A must see for any visitor to Singapore. Nothing like it anywhere else in the world. Our little family thoroughly enjoyed the experience.,,
,,Unique,5,,"There are different themes during different seasons for the paid domes. Free entry areas are also very well kept and beautiful. Paid domes are unlike any other gardens you've seen, definitely worth a visit. Do bring a light cardigan though as the domes can get a bit chilly. Worth checking out marina barrage and / or satay by the bay for food before / after your visit.",,
,,"Wow, Wow, Wow!",5,,"This place is AMAZING.
Obviously, by the name, the gardens are the draw-card. The displays and varieties in the flower dome are fantastic, and definitely a must see. Then, you walk into the cloud forest. *Mind-blown*...
The size, the levels of the rain forest display are amazing and architecturally, the structure is unbelievable!
Very happy that we visited, and highly recommend to all that travel to Singapore.",,
,,Unigue gardens in an air-conditioned setting with changing exhibits,5,,"The two main areas are the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. Not my first vist but continued to be impressed and fascinated by both. As in previous visits, I prefer the Flower Dome, although both are impressive. There is a changing exhibition during different periods of the year . Guide told us the flowers and plants are grown months in advance in their nursery and displayed at the Flower Dome. It requires months of forward planning, selection of flowers and the displays require imaginative landscaping.",,
,,Enjoying,5,,If I say one word about this place is amazing..v could enjoyed the real natural beauty.. real experience for rainforest..,,
,,Manmade attraction that delights the visual senses.,3,,It's a nice stop for a one-time experience (day/night) but especially at night for the musical lights show.,,
,,A Floral Walk,5,,Wonderfully design with beautiful flowers welcoming each guest. Just can't take your eyes away from any floral plants. Each visit is greeted with a different theme. Great place for floral lovers.,,
,,Dome Gardens,5,,These were spectacular gardens under glass domes - one was a tropical forest and the other flowers. Both exceeded our expectations. It is worth going late in the afternoon and staying until dark to experience the mushroom shaped domes light up to opera - a spectacular show.,,
,,beautiful,5,,"beautiful garden, very good light show at night, just put on insect repellent and be prepared for the heat. but it's cold inside the domes. so you may need a jacket for that.",,
,,lovely time in Garden by the Bay,5,,"as a citizen of an asian country, we have more in common in our home base the plants that Garden by the Bay have. But, we still enjoy this place so much. they offer much variety in such beautiful arrangement that can makes our kids love their time spent in there.",,
,,Relaxing Experience at Gardens by the Bay,5,,"We have visited Gardens by the Bay several times, going inside twice to see the beautiful arrangements of flowers and views which are definitely worth a visit as they are breathtaking. We have also enjoyed walking around the free outside area, which is really great after a flight. The supertrees are amazing - it's so good to see what can be done to show nature in all its beauty, combined with the feat of constructing the supertrees. We were fortunate on this trip, to witness the display by the Singapore Airforce parachutists who were performing as part of the upcoming celebration of Singapore's National Day. The air is good, the scenery superb with the amazing Marina Bay Sands hotel as a backdrop for selfies. We haven't yet seen the light show but we enjoyed watching the huge fish and turtle in the big aquarium. Gardens by the Bay is the best place to relax and refresh while getting some exercise.",,
,,Something new in Asia,4,,"Being a resident of Singapore, I have visited the place many a times. In deed a nice place with totally different experience. Both the dome has enough attractions to amaze you including your family. conveniently located in city center with a rain forest experience and flower dome will give you a new whole world of flowers.",,
,,Amazing,5,,"I bought on line to avoid cues on site.
This was our highlight of the trip. It is easy to navigate even if you are a little older or in a wheelchair. There are ramps and elevators throughout. The inside is a nice cool break from the humid weather.
The whole facility is well presented and worth the price of entry.",,
,,Gardens By the Bay,5,,"Loved this place, would go again in a heartbeat. Clean, easy to get around, so much to see. We spent about 3 hours there and was enough time to see everything, easy walk to Marina Bay Sands for more sightseeing",,
,,Great Gardens best in the world,5,,"Must visit when in Singapore, took my family including my 5 year old grandson, everyone really enjoyed there is something for all ages",,
,,Great family day out!,4,,"Went there as part of my daughters school trip, not only did she learn something so did the parents. Lovely place to go, quite abit to see too they have sky garden. Best to bring ur own Sandwhiches n water coz its abit expensive there. But could always hop on the train to suntec across the road and there is loads of food options.",,
,,nice place. have a water area for kids.,5,,Garden by the bay is really a nice place for a stroll and there is a great water play area for the kids. remember to bring a change of clothes for the water play area.,,
,,Lovely place for scenic beauty.. Feast to the eyes,5,,"We had been to Gardens by the bay couple of times, however it was limited to doom and rainforest. In our recent visit we visited the children park, it was a great experience. Kids will have best time and wouldnt want to go back..",,
,,Handicap trip to garden,5,,My handicap mom (on wheelchair) finds gardens by the Bay a great place to view flowers & all the themed events organised. Lovely place to spent the day with family & sure a place to bond and admire all the things.,,
,,Review,4,,Nice to include in your iteneary when in Singapore but do go in the late afternoon to avoid the heat and wait for the light show at night.,,
,,Beautiful!,5,,"The gardens are so well done, very clean and tidy and great photo opportunities. Everything is kept well looked after.",,
,,Oasis,5,,"Gardens by the bay is an oasis of plants and flowers. We visited during Christmas and the decorations were gorgeous. The air in the dome is refreshing and a great time to visit is after lunch where the heat makes it difficult to visit the outdoor attractions. Do set aside 2 to 3 hours to enjoy. In the evenings, best to bring a sweater as it gets chilly.",,
,,Cloud dome is a must,5,,"An amazing place, very spectacular even if your aren鈥檛 a horticultural expert. Well worth a visit. It takes about 40mins to stroll round or longer if you want to take an in depth look at all the exhibits.",,
,,Delight at every step,5,,"I really like Gardens by the Bay. Seen from above at Marina Bay Sands viewing platform (especially at night) you get a true sense of the magic of this beautifully landscaped garden. I love to cycle through -or wander on foot through the many avenues and lanes - it's a place with many different moods from the central avenue with its two biospheres looking like mechanical armadillos - housing tropical rainforest species in one and desert cacti in the other - to its forest of artificial trees that glow so magically at night. It's a romantic place to stroll In at night beautifully illuminated in soft glowing tones, or an energetic place to enjoy during the day amongst the joggers, cyclists and day strollers - you may even see an otter or two if you are lucky. With many sculptures awaiting to be discovered it's an open air art gallery too and if you have children it's the perfect place to let them loose. Like all things in singapore it's beautifully maintained, very accessible and a place I visit at least once a month because it's simply lovely.",,
,,The gardens are lovely to visit but there is limited information available about the flora and fauna.,3,,Need interactive display. More helping and visitor friendly staff required. More hype than reality. It鈥檚 certainly a display worth a visit. Gift shop is over priced and so is the food in prema cafe,,
,,Impressive,5,,"I've been invited by my friends and my kids to visit the garden, but I was hesitant about the level of surprise for a ""garden"". My last visit was an eye opener, I'm truly impressed. Thank you for having us for such a world class garden in a topical country like Singapore.",,
,,Nice garden and good view of the Singapore river and city scape,4,,The garden is in the city area and offer a good view of Singapore river and city view. It offers a scenic walk path and is good for morning walk or jog. A must-go for all foreign visitors to Singapore.,,
,,A must to see on your trip to Singapore,5,,My favorite thing we did in Singapore! Absolutely beautiful gardens and seeing the light show at night is absolutely worth the trip back in the evening. We walked over from Marina Bay during the day which was great for the views and went to Satay by the Bay for a cheap bite to eat.,,
,,A Wonder of the World,5,,"When in Singapore this attraction is a must to see.
A combination of outdoor gardens, Flower Dome and Cloud Forrest.
A man made wonder on reclaimed land using state of the art engineering.
You might need to wear a jacket in the indoor gardens as it can be a bit cool from the amazing natural convection system.
The outdoor night time light show is a must to see and it's free. Get there about 7:15 pm to get a good location for pics and videos",,
,,World Class Site,5,,"This is a very pleasant way to spend half a day. It has wheelchair access. Garden dome is world class with interesting plant species and displays. Cloud dome is slippery in parts and anyone with an aversion to heights will not enjoy it,More suited for over 50's and flower lovers.
Stunning light nightime show to music in the palms outside the domes at 7.45 and 8.45pm which finishes the experience.",,
,,Nature within the busy city,5,,We went here for some relaxation and this place did not disappoint. It was the closes to nature that we can get if you are in the middle of a city. Worth every minute of our time!,,
,,Repeat visit,5,,"Its not my first time for sure, but they will always change the theme for the flower dome to suit the season. About 4 times a year. Great visit even if its just outside the domes and the sky walk is another view to see.",,
,,Lovely Gardens,5,,"Spend a couple of hours in the gardens which are quite spectacular, sadly we did not have enough time in Singapore to be able to visit the domes but we did manage the skyway walk. Light show was also quite excellent",,
,,Amazing experience,5,,"My family and I had a great time there.
You get to see not only native plants, but also plants from other parts of the world. If you鈥檙e lucky, like we were, you also see exhibits from your home. We were very excited when we saw this.
Apart from the plants there were lots of beautiful exhibits with artworks.
It鈥檚 a must do while in Singapore.",,
,,European Garden,5,,Very interesting European garden with roses etc ...so like home!! View the Gardens by the Bay from the Marina Sands Hotel...Fabulous!,,
,,Very nice view,5,,It鈥檚 very nice view the garden wow so amazing place must if u very Singapore 馃嚫馃嚞 u must visit the garden 馃槏,,
,,Memorable experience,5,,"It was a memorable experience and the orchestra was super exhilarating. Wonderful service, though a bit expensive, at Super Tree IndoChine Restaurant. Had the opportunity to meet the founder of the restaurant Mr. Ma馃憤",,
,,Excellent!,5,,Went to the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. Both are great! My parents were in love with the variety of the flowers. Cloud Forest was exceptionally breath-taking. Worth the visit!,,
,,A must see in Singapore,5,,If you are in Singapore for a very short stay and have to select a must see then gardens by the Bay and night safari are truly unique experiences which you will not find anywhere else,,
,,Nature's paradise,5,,"Really beautiful garden, a must visit in Singapore. The flower dome is colorful and amazing. The waterfall and the plants in other done is also worth the visit.",,
,,Good for afternoon,5,,"Probably spend an hour for each of the Dome if you are not ultimate picky on each of the photo you take, and come out around 7:40pm to catch the light show in the super tree areas. Perfect.",,
,,The air couldn't get any fresher,5,,"Went there a few times either to explore/walk around and for the annual Christmas Wonderland. Inhale a breath of fresh air and away from the hustle and bustle of Singapore's fast paced urban jungle lifestyle. There are plenty of food amenities within the vicinity catering to different budgets and cuisines. Tourist can check out the IndoChine restaurant and rooftop bar and Pollen restaurant (located inside the Flower Dome) or if you you'd like a taste of local flavours, head over to Satay By The Bay and enjoy a sumptuous spread overlooking to waterfront.",,
,,Family trip to singapore,5,,"2 buildings with a cloud forest and plants this is a wonderful place to enjoy your evening in singapore. You go up there in the day time and walk around the walkway, there's also a bar at the top of the highest one. There's a show at night from around 7:30 and 8:30 . Truly one of the most amazing places I have ever been and I really look forward to coming back.",,
,,Amazing,4,,"I鈥檓 not easily impressed but it was a great experience to spend a few hours in these 鈥榞ardens鈥? The entrance is free however to visit the 鈥榙omes鈥?you have to pay a fee.
Like many things in Singapore very well maintained. One dome was closed (the trees) and some construction going on. Nice to combine with nearby chopping malls.",,
,,Easily the highlight of the holiday,5,,"The whole area, including the two domes that require paid admission is fantastic. It's amazing how they have created the indoor gardens. The Rhapsody light and music show in the supertree grove is an absolute must for any visitor.",,
,,Sight Seeing,5,,"Well set out. Clean. English signs clearly displayed. Walking distance to Casino. I visited at 7.45pm and the park closes at 9.30pm on a Saturday night. If you enter near 8pm, you miss out on seeing this attraction properly. Aim to get there at 6pm at the latest so you can truly enjoy the whole experience. No cost to see the trees which light up at night, so you could see the gardens during the day if you want and go see the tree light shows around 8pm. Definitely plan to visit this place again on my next visit to Singapore.",,
,,Amazing light show,5,,We only went for the light show and it was really very beautiful. Lots of people but as it mostly was high up in the supertrees everyone had a good view.,,
,,Wow wow wow wow !!!!,5,,"Absolutely amazing.
I could have spent 4 days here and only just seen all there is to experience.
The actual outdoor gardens are free to enter and are beautiful and sprawling.
Each night there is a 15 min show during darkness amongst the tall trees that is set to music and features spectacular lighting anongst the trees that changes with the music, all set to the amazing backdrop view of Marina Bay Sands Hotel.
The actual 2 paid attractions, the indoor climate controlled cloud forest and flower dome are equally amazing.
I won't go in to detail other than to say that Gardens By The Bay should be listed in 'The 7 wonders of the world', it's that amazing.
Can't wait to go back again in the future.",,
,,Spectacular,5,,Definitely visit this whilst in Singapore. Monumental sights all around and you'll need your camera handy!,,
,,Love this place,5,,"Fantastic visit, loved it the gardens are well looked after and amazing. We paid for the 2 domes and the skywalk.
Don鈥檛 do the skywalk if you are scared of heights it really is high with amazing views over the city.
The Domes were breath taking, we were not rushed round and felt totally at ease to take our time.
The place was also spotless, even if
master chef final was being recorded (won鈥檛 revel the winner)
Great place to visit",,
,,Beautiful visit,4,,"Beautiful visit, both domes and the skywalk are a nice visit when in Singapore. The whole garden is a nice place to take a walk in, much to see.",,
,,Wow! Unique!,5,,"This is a not to be missed in Singapore. The Cloud Forest is beyond description. It is a man made feat displaying foliage within tropic and mountainous climates. Even if you are not a garden lover, and I am not, you need to visit this site.",,
,,One of a kind,5,,I had recently been to gardens by the bay. It was so fascinating. Singapore never fails to disappoint. It was world class and the audio tour i took was wonderful. they took us on a 20 minute tour around the place and it was incredible. will surely visit again.,,
,,Mixed bag,2,,"We visited during the morning on a Monday only to find out that one of the conservatories was closed for maintenance. Based on the information I received this happens Monday and Tuesday - Monday the Cloud Forest is closed and on Tuesday the Flower Dome is closed. Thus being there on a Monday, open for us to see was the flower dome, I was less than impressed after seeing the National Orchid Garden on the previous day - Yes it was nice to be in cool place but the garden as such was 100% Disney, not at all worth the $14 per person spent.

The Supertree grove was kind of cool and futuristic but probably much more exciting to visit in the evening.

Unfortunately left the place less than impressed.",,
,,Fancy gardens and epxensive,5,,you get two closed chambers with plenty of gardens and water fall and flowers. amazing to see and worth its pricy tickets. it is a signature of Singapore. it is very close to the lovely super tree where you can enjoy free light and music show at night.,,
,,Awesome place,5,,"The gardens are fabulous, but you need a whole day to walk round them, do the sky walkover which is spectacular. The places to eat in the park are very reasonably price as are the souvenir shops.",,
,,Incredible,5,,It was worth it. The display was amazing. But It was crowded. Gardens By The Bay is on the metro line. It is very easy to get to. Recommend!!,,
,,Impressive,5,,"We were fortunate enough to be here for a wedding. The wedding was held in the Fields of Flowers Hall. So beautifully set up on the night. You felt like you were on a movie set. The food on the vending was lovely and plentiful.
The Gardens by the Bay are quite impressive. So many different areas to look at it and views to take in. As mentioned we saw it at night when it鈥檚 all lit up and returned the next morning to see them by day.
There is a sky walk you can do which you pay to use. The only down side to that is that you are limited to 15 minutes and they don鈥檛 tell you that when you purchase the ticket.
However I would recommend a visit to the Gardens and definitely take your camera.",,
,,Visit this at night!,5,,"The Gardens by the Bay looks awesome from afar at day time, but it is best at night.

At around 9pm, there was a show (opera songs) for free. The entrance to the area, directly under the tall structures, is also free. You have to pay for special exhibitions, though.

It gets crowded on weekends, so avoid said days. Also avoid rush/peak hours, since getting a cab will be difficult and a lot more expensive.

One of the most convenient ways of reaching it is through the bridge from Marina Bay Sands.",,
,,Stunning,5,,Beautiful place and really well done If you are in Singapore this is a must Make sure you go into the kids area as well great if you have little ones,,
,,Thoroughly enjoyable experience,5,,Lovely green area in Singapore that is surprisingly large. Great to walk around the free parts but the paid for Cloud Forest and Flower Dome are well worth it. The waterfall in the Cloud Forest took my breath away. Would thoroughly recommend.,,
,,Excellent for the family,4,,A huge parkland and gardens area to be explored on foot for a few hours with much to see and do. Highlight is the evening light show with music which is sensational and free.,,
,,Unforgettable light show in amazing Singapore,5,,"We were very pleased! Thank you for the unforgettable show which we came to see on our first evening in Singapore
We are looking forward to visiting the Gardens in one year and to seeing more new things and lights! Singapore is the most amazing place on earth",,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,"We visited the Gardens by the Bay last week in Singapore. The gardens were so vibrant, full of colour, so healthy and lush and such a wide variety as well. The nightly light show is a must see also. It was so fantastic. Definitely a must see on your things to see in Singapore.",,
,,Enchanting indoor garden,5,,"The huge indoor garden was very well Maintained. It had a very nice collection of flowers, cactus, succulents, and exotic plants. Felt cool and fresh inside. Staff were nice and ticketing were very helpful. A must visit when in Singapore !",,
,,Amazing!!!,5,,"We were told by our daughter to visit Gardens by the Bay as it was spectacular and we were not disappointed! We spent several hours there and could have stayed longer if time had permitted. All of the displays are truly breath taking. The Flower Dome is well laid out and the displays are magnificent. It is not just the plants but the way sculptures are blended in is imaginatively done. Would recommend this to anyone.
A tip: spend $3 on the shuttle. Worth every cent!",,
,,Wonderful,5,,"Gardens by the Bay should be on every itinerary when visiting Singapore, with or without children. This is a unique experience hard to find anywhere else in the world. Go and see the shows with light and music in the evening. It is nothing short of magical. And it's free! Consider paying to visit the cloud forest and flower dome too when you are there. You've probably nerver seen anything like it and it is well worth the money in my opinion",,
,,Must see,5,,"Has to be seen. The whole area is spectacular. The $3 investment for the shuttle is great value for tired feet and lasts all day back and forth. You鈥檙e given a rubber stamp to confirm your purchase but I鈥檇 keep the receipt if you sweat a lot on hot days. The same system applies for the flower domes as well.
The domes are a gardeners nirvana. The size and variety amazes.
The evening outside light show to orchestral is a joy. Felt like being in an avatar movie. We went twice an watched from a platform attached to the amazing hotel overlooking the park and then up close. Both were truly worth it.
At the end try and go through the hotel to the water light show on the other side. Another great experience.
Then back to what has to be the best subway system in the world. Enjoy.",,
,,Singapore must Do,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is a breathtaking attraction which amazes and educates.

The Cloud dome takes you to a fresh mountain environment and gently leads you back to the forest floor. Introducing thousands of beautiful plants along the way.

The Center of the display is a beautiful 30m high waterfall with elevated walking paths that lead out into the clouds.

A truly amazing experience.

Hints:
Take bottled water. There are stations to refill.
Take cash or card. Such an advanced country still doesn鈥檛 widely accept pay wave or phone pay
Pay the $3 per person (ride all day) for the electric shuttle bus, saves a 15 minute walk each way in the heat.
Wear a hat and comfy shoes.

Take your time and enjoy the experience",,
,,A must visit,4,,"A top attraction , the design and thought that has been put into this place is substantial and is very easy to appreciate certainly a must visit.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,"So when you first get to Singapore, the first thing that will hit you is the heat and humidity during this time of the year but a trip to gardens by the bay will help cool you off. 2 wonderful gardens inside air conditioned domes that offer alot of great views and foliage. A must visit when you come to Singapore. Check out in the indoor waterfall!",,
,,Unique place.,5,,Spent half a day here. If you have only day or 2 in Singapore. This is the place to be covered. The giant tree structures are unique to Singapore. If possible plan to stay for light show around 8 pm in the night.,,
,,Great place to go,5,,Went here on day I was due to fly home. It was a good venue when conscious of time. We visited the cloud forest and flower dome. Both were well worth the visit,,
,,Amazing and Beautiful,5,,Amazing place with beautiful range of flowers.You can see everything naturally created. Both sections are so nice and creative. It is must see place.,,
,,What鈥檚 the fuzz all about?,2,,"I鈥檓 not sure how to rate this but really, it鈥檚 an exaggeration. Yes the plants were beautiful. Yes the waterfalls is nice. Yes the other parts of this side of Singapore is nice but the hype is an overkill.

Maybe because it鈥檚 not really the garden per se that is enticing people all over to go gaga over this garden. Maybe it鈥檚 the ingenuity of the Singaporeans it self.

The price is just way too much outrageous for such a place.",,
,,Truly Amazing,5,,"A must see in Singapore, the flowers dome and cloud dome are both definitely interesting and well worth a visit.",,
,,"This is probably your highlight, that doesnt say much for Singapore",3,,"It was a nice walk around the gardens but knowing this was one of the best tourist attractions in Singapore kind of makes you think... what am I doing here... there isn't much to do in Singapore and it is an extremely expensive country, even in relation to Australia, my advice is transit through KL, HK or BKK... Singapore isnt worth the effort.",,
,,"More too trees ,green leaves. Very little flower",3,,Place is big and the dome comes with aircond. So disappointed no much types of flowers to see. Can't even find sunflower. Everywhere u see is just green colors. Even if there is flower is very normal and small. Was hoping to see more big colorful flowers,,
,,Excellent,5,,"It's an amazing place to see all kinds of flower & plants under one roof , with excellent presentation. Great location, place is well connected by all the modes of transportation. Cloud forest is amazing place with water falls & skywalk etc.",,
,,Lovely visit,4,,Headed here for the day on what was a humid day and was pleasantly surprised by the cool temp inside the gardens. The skywalk among the super trees well worth the extra money and a definite must to stay and watch the light show at night time.,,
,,Worth the walk,2,,Enjoyable walk around the gardens and trees. Weather was looking unpredictable so was a quick visit.,,
,,Night tour of Garden by the Bay Singapore,5,,"Our Hotel suggested this tour as something different that we might enjoy. They were right. Firstly we were picked up from our hotel, then returned back to the lobby at the end of the night. This makes things easy and convenient. The experience of visiting the Gardens by the Bay was very unique. The plants are from every country and are housed in a specially designed building with a controlled environment that promotes prolific growth. There are small flowers, climbing vines, huge trees all interspersed with interesting themed sculptures all set out in individual country sectors. Then was a light display that with opera music was very entertaining. The tour the moves on to the top of the highest building in Singapore for a finale that is a real standout. From this vantage point we got an outlook that includes the gardens, the Bay, the city of Singapore and then the guide pointed out how much of this is built on reclaimed land. I can truly recommend this tour as a great experience.",,
,,Money,4,,This place is beautiful.. but bring your wallet if you plan on doing more than wandering the grounds. We accessed the park by walking across the helix bridge and then entering the large mall. There are escalators leading to the roof where you can walk across the highway to the marina bay sands. You are free to wander but the high walkways and cloud forest and flower garden will cost you quite a bit.,,
,,Don't miss them,5,,"Having visited Singapore's botanical garden in the morning I personally thought Gardens by the Bay in the afternoon would be overkill, especially for our 9 and 12 year old grandsons. Far from the truth. The botanical garden has a traditional species collection orientation; the Gardens by the Bay have the ecosystem perspective - so in fact that are complementary. The super trees, the greenhouses and the skywalk are all great ways of better understanding the ecology of forests and the plant world in general. Highly recommended.",,
,,Amazing!,5,,"It's an amazing man made jungle! I have interest in botanic, and this place has plenty variations plants.",,
,,Out of this world,5,,"My second time in singapore, and didn鈥檛 go inside the domes or up on the boardwalk.$28 best value for money. A true highlight, not to be missed.",,
,,Everything so tidy up!,5,,The gardens were just amazing and I was lucky enough cos it was a rainy day and by the time I got there it stopped :) I would suggest you pay and go up the main tree so you can enjoy some air con and have a really expensive coffee or water and of course have a great view of marina bay sands sky deck!,,
,,Relaxing and enjoyable,5,,"We had a relaxing and enjoyable day in the garden. In the evening we stumbled upon a great light show in the middle of the garden. All around a very nice experience, would recommend.",,
,,Good for evening.,3,,"It鈥檚 an ok place for an evening visit.
Actually it鈥檚 rated highly which actually it is not.
There is only one light show and that too an ok ok thing.
The staff are courteous and helpful.
I suggest if u planning to visit please reach early as its heavily crowed at the time of light show and the place to watch it from is not that gud.",,
,,Nice garden love it,5,,"Awesome... good view,, country clean, garden so beautiful 馃槏馃槏馃槏 Recomended for relax, transportation MRT and Bus very good.. I will miss this place 馃巹馃巹馃巹",,
,,Amazing!,5,,"I visited the gardens of the bay both during dayyime and in the evening. It's very nice! In the evening it gets very crowded because a lot of people want to enjoy the lightshow. If you want to return to your hotel or wherever, and you want a taxi, go to the mainroad and grt a cab there, so you dont have to wait in line..",,
,,The light show is not to be missed,5,,"Generally, these gardens are great, they are large, lots of education information and something on offer for couples, friends and families alike. There are several places to eat and buy drinks.

However, the main reason to visit the gardens is the light show! It is free to access the gardens and each night there a light show is conducted on the trees within the gardens, with accompanying music.

Whilst the light show gets extremely busy every night, you cannot miss this when in Singapore. By far the best light show on offer and it really will overwhelm you with a happy feeling of being lucky enough to visit Singapore and witness this show.

DO NOT MISS THIS WHEN IN SINGAPORE!!",,
,,"crowded, hot, but have incredible view.",3,,"The garden best viewed at night, with colorful lights, and beautiful city lights surrounding the area. But sometimes get too crowded, and too hot to walk and to enjoy. Perhaps better to visit late at night when not so many people come.",,
,,A great family venue,5,,We spent a relaxing day at this venue in Singapore. It caters well for children and also disabled children. We were even able to take our wheelchair bound grandson on the sky walk thanks to appropriately placed lifts.,,
,,Exceptional,5,,"A must visit when in Singapore. Well worth the money to go into the domes. Both very good, but I prefer the mountain cloud dome, it's spectacular. The night show in the gardens is not to be missed",,
,,wonderful,4,,"it is so wonderful place, well organised and all the plant are amazing. The light show at night is so so not too fancy if compare with the one at harbour.

tips : save your energy for this place, you might have to walk a lots!",,
,,Must do in Singapore!,5,,"Beautiful gardens that are really well looked after and maintained! We went several times during our stay in Singapore! We walked around the gardens, the supertrees and even did the sky walk in the super trees. The view from their was amazing! We then stayed to watch the light show during the night time and that was incredible! Definitely not to be missed by anyone in Singapore! The following day we came back to go in both of the biomes which were even better than what we expected! The sheer amount of flowers and plants were incredible and it was absolutely stunning the way that they have laid them all out on display! Another thing I can definitely stay is a must during your stay in Singapore!",,
,,So damn good I went back for seconds!,5,,"Possibly the best value tourist attraction in Singapore. Apart from the giant glass houses / herbariums one can stroll around this giant park for free. There's plenty of wonderful gardens, great vistas back toward the city and the light show (also free) is most impressive. This show is held twice per night and it's worth seeing from one point then watching an hour later from another. Although it costs a few bucks to get into the glass houses these are worth the expense.",,
,,The Spectacular in a close touch,5,,"Seeing it in pictures is nothing compared to being in the real place...""Gerdens by the Bay"" is a must-be-there place for everyone when you are in Singapore. Whether you go there to roam around for free or you pay a little more for interesting touch and feel, you will find it totally worth your while. Nothing much said but to actually be there!",,
,,well worth a visit,5,,"this site is an engineering marvel, well organised, 1st rate in every way, take a guided tour by trolly car for overview, then continue on foot, hot & humid, but plenty of shade & cafes,",,
,,Manufactured tourist attraction,3,,An islet built on reclaimed land from the sea. A lake to walk round with loads of aquatic plants. It is a free tourist destination to admire loads of greenery. A safe place to have a long stroll.,,
,,Super activity for a non-activity person,5,,Most of my travel activity revolves around shopping - the Gardens by the Bay are a breathe of fresh air and highly recommended for Singapore visitors and residents to recenter themselves,,
,,Beautiful place to visit,5,,The supertrees were just amazing. Be sure to visit at night for the light shows at 7:45 & 8:45. Each for 15 min time. The light dances with the music. It was great. Walk on the skyline between the trees & take some panoramic pictures.,,
,,Must visit,5,,Beautiful natural settings surrounded with lovely plants. Don鈥檛 forget to stay for the light show! Best place for photo as you can also capture the Marina Bay Sands Facade.,,
,,Ok visit,3,,Gardens by the Bay is ok to visit. We visited late in the evening to enjoy the lights and sounds show. There's not much to do here other than enjoying green plants and lights show.,,
,,Lots of photo opportunities,4,,"A lovely place but so crowded even on weekdays. It shows how successful the gardens are . The floral dome is worth visiting, any time. The special exhibitions are meticulously planned. If you have time, make a reservation for tea or lunch at Pollen and your visit to the flower dome will be free.",,
,,Must visit,5,,A must visit place ... And dont forget to check cloud dome ... And if you are a flower fan ... Flowerdome will make you crazzzyyy,,
,,Nice Attraction,5,,Fun place to go with kids and interesting for adults as well. The cloud forest and flower dome are a must visit.,,
,,"Amazing place, must visit!!!",5,,"The domes are a sight to behold, nothing like I have seen before! The sky walk is also a must do experience, so is the light and sound show there. Lying in the grass, looking up at the play of lights was one of the best experiences i have had! the costs are like 1.5k per dome and sky walk, but totally worth it!",,
,,Not to be missed!,5,,"If you thought Gardens by the Bay was a place to visit at only at night, you'd be wrong. We first took the audio tour to get our bearings and then joined the very efficiently managed queue to buy tickets to the two domes. Both the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome were spectacular in different ways. Truly marvellous!",,
,,always loving it,5,,coming back with family and friends regular. First time I thought I dont like these artificial type of buildings but its actually eco and the plants are stunning.,,
,,Garden with wow effect,5,,Very nice and exotic garden. You can see that the garden is arranged with lot of love to details. There are awesome light effects in the entrance area. Unfortunately you need a lot of time to explore all. One day is not enough for sure. For people who love exotic Vegetation it's absolutely a must go.,,
,,Disappointing hype,3,,Heard a lot about the gardens back home and when i did a tour it was very disappointing. Super trees galore and a light show. Maybe it was the tour I did but the emphasis was on the Super Trees which are man made trees with foliage covering them. Light and sound show was ok but not really a lot of gardens to see. Probably an hour or so in total spent here which was plenty. A lot of money was spent apparently on these gardens and probably money best spent elsewhere.,,
,,"Beautiful gardens, spectacular indoor waterfalls.",4,,"A must-do when in Singapore. Beautiful gardens and floral setups, with spectacular indoor waterfalls. Can be very crowded at times.",,
,,"""Treat to the eyes""",5,,Thoroughly enjoyed the gardens by the bay. Superb varieties of flowers and excellent arrangements. Lastly the sound and light show was really mesmerising. One should't miss this while in Singapore.,,
,,Enormous and beautiful,5,,"Allow plenty of time, even for just the glass houses. Don't miss the tiny orchids under magnification. Afternoon tea was the best!",,
,,Tranquility,5,,Stunning layout & lovely designed gardens. Even though busy with tourists it鈥檚 not uncomfortable. Light & music show in the evening. Well worth the visit,,
,,Fresh.,4,,"Good to have a garden next to the bustling city. Right next to the Marina Bay Sands and the railway station. Must go to the skybridge, the view is stunning!",,
,,Beautiful lightshow in the evening!,4,,Absolutely stunning light show in the evening! I would recommend this to anyone going to Singapore. Enjoy!,,
,,Amazing,5,,This place is amazing. The flower dome and cloud forest are well worth the entry fee. Lots of other free stuff to look at. The garden rhapsody light show at night is very good.,,
,,Gardens By The Bay Singapore,5,,"This has to one of the best plant collections in the world 鈥?it is certainly one of the best presented. The gardens themselves are free, tickets for the domes were $SD56 (around 拢30 for two). The gardens are beautiful and then you go into the domes 鈥?WOW! Pleasantly cool in the Singapore March heat, the domes are simply breath taking. The whole site is impeccably clean and the sineage excellent, you could easily spend a whole day and evening here. This attraction is very popular, the food and drink outlets were frantically busy. However with a little patience we got some excellent photos without tourists or selfie sticks in them. TOP TIP 鈥?Make sure that you stay until the evening music and light show in the Super Tree Grove - it is very, very impressive and you also get some fantastic views of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel as you exit the park.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay,4,,"This place is also one of the main tourist attractionThe best time to visit this place is after 5pm. You can spend few hours exploring the Garden & Sky walk. There is musical show around 7pm onwards which was fantastic & not to be missed.

Would suggest buying online ticket in advance which is available at very cheap price. We bought it from Voyagein.com a Combo pack that includes Gardens by the Bay with sky Walk, Flower Dome & Cloud forest.",,
,,Wonderful,5,,"A must see in Singapore. Includes various outdoor theme gardens (World of Plants, Heritage Gardens, The Meadow, etc.; free), glasshouses wonderlands (entry fees apply), water features, restaurants, walkways and the Supertree Grove with its Skyway walk (fee to go up). Nice by day but stay till early evening to see the lights, especially the spine tingling light and music show Garden Rhapsody in the main Supertree Grove (7.45 pm and 8.45 pm shows). Access via Bayfront MRT and combine the day with activities at Marina Bay Sands.",,
,,Excellent Gardens,5,,So glad we visited flower displays were amazing so many beautiful colours . Well laid out with pathways and seats for enjoying from every aspect . The cloud forest and tree top walk is a must do too!,,
,,Singapores jewel in the crown,5,,"Singapore has outdone itself!
The work and beautiful displays here was a sight to behold.
So much to see and take in.
Everything here from beautiful flower displays and tall waterfalls in the dome to small lakes with lillies and dragons, turtles and cranes.
We visited twice to take in the evening light show also.
So many beautiful photo opportunities....
Well done Singapore!",,
,,Best!!!,5,,Gardens by the bay is one of the most beautiful places we鈥檝e seen. The light show was amazing 馃槈 Must not miss this when visiting singapore 馃嚫馃嚞,,
,,Tomorrow's Gardens?,4,,"Two weeks ago we spent the afternoon and evening at This major tourist attraction. We visited the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome interspersed with a seafood lunch at Majestic Bay Seafood Restaurant and then enjoyed the wonderful ""son et lumiere"" in the Supertree Grove. You could almost imagine yourself in the forests of Pandora (brought to life in Avatar). However, there was a strange sense as we walked through the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome of artificiality - that the beauty and magic of nature was being held captive by giant glass-houses. Tourists flocked to see a world that might well be disappearing from parts of the planet (so well-portrayed in the 1972 film Silent Running).

Let's not forget the beauty of nature while we still have it!",,
,,Fantastic daytime and spectacular at night,5,,"A must for everyone , an amazing design with plants from all over the world.
Arrive in the afternoon to see the gardens by daylight and you have to stay for the music and light show at night it's absolutely spectacular.
Garden Rhapsody light and sound times are;
First show 7.45PM
Second show 8.45pm
Each last 15mins
Don't forget to have a drink at the INDOCHINA BAR , have a look at the photo. $20 entry but includes a drink.",,
,,Em's on Tour,5,,"Fabulous addition for a visit to Singapore. The beautiful, developing gardens are free to walk around at leisure and charges are made only on visiting the two biosphere domes - each very worthwhile.
A nominal charge to walk the Skywalk would be an adventure to be among the Grove of Trees.
The audio tour was insightful, a little costly for 20 minutes but it outlined the breadth of just what the Gardens by the Bay has to offer. We visited twice and could still find more to see when we return.",,
,,Fantastic in every way,5,,What an amazing place. We absolutely loved it. The whole place us wonderful. We spent the whole afternoon wandering around taking all the amazing sights then took the sky walk as it got dark. We stayed for the night show which was truly amazing. Cannot recommend thus enough.,,
,,Garden of the future,5,,"Gardens by the bay is absolutely stunning, from the grove of super trees to the flower dome and cloud forest it is easy to spend hours wandering around this park. There are multiple different sections with different themes and fun structures. They even have informative plaques around to learn more about all the different plants and why the park came to be.

There are a couple of different restaurants around here and every night at a couple different times there is a show out on where the super trees light up and change to the music(garden rhapsody). Many festivals are held in gardens by the bay throughout the year, my friends and I were able to partake in the harvest festival as well as the Christmas festival, both were very fun as the park was filled with decorations and vendors.

I visited here many times during my stay in Singapore and every time I fell in love. Such a magnificent place, a must visit while in Singapore!!",,
,,Breathtaking,5,,"This is a must visit for anyone going to or through Singapore. These man made wonders will have you in awe. The Gardens are free, but if you want to go up to the bridge, there is a fee, and a maximum of a 15 minute visit - this is worth it for the view, and the different perspective of the Gardens",,
,,Magical,5,,Gardens by the bay is a must. Walking from one flower to the other so high above the ground in amazing. Try the bar above one the the flowers for the best views of singapore The night show is spectacular for all ages. 10 out of 10,,
,,Landscape Architecture,4,,"Flower gardens combine plants of different heights, colors, textures, and fragrances to create interest and delight the senses.",,
,,A beautiful spot,5,,"Beautiful gardens, the cloud dome is my favourite. So green and cool and beautiful and has education sections on environmental issues and sustainability which is great! Worth the money for the entry ticket.",,
,,Great Space,4,,Over all this space is pretty cool. There are restaurants and of course gardens. I would recommend doing the 2 main exhibits (Cloud Dome and Flower Room) and then staying for the show at the SuperTrees.,,
,,Amazing place,5,,We came by as it was just adjacent to our hotel. I've been to Singapore a couple of times but never had a chance to visit gardens by the bay. Its a huge futuristic nature park with an indoor greenhouse. I'd love to comeback soon with my kids,,
,,Try to beat the crowd,5,,"Whatever flowers are in display, they are always beautiful and fun to vsit. If you have nowhere to go, always good to visit Garden by the Bay as it won't fail you. Just know how to beat the crowd or if you can't avoid them at all, know how to entertain yourself while queuing for entrance. I would suggest to avoid weekends if possible.",,
,,Can't get enough of the light show,5,,Can't get enough of the light show. They have thematic light show and this time we watched the Jurassic World version. Tips: Bring your mat to enjoy the show,,
,,Eco friendly attraction,5,,"This is a free area to visit. Magnificent combination of environmental care, beauty and interest. Night music light rhapsody show the best thing I have seen.",,
,,Stunning attraction,5,,Easily understandable why this is Singapore's No 1 attraction - an absolute must see. The two main domes contain so much to enjoy and the rest of the park is a great walk. The light show at night is a must see.,,
,,Watch at night,4,,We visit the Gardens by the bay bevor we went to Maria Bay Sense. The view is very awesome but I think it's enough to see the supertrees at night,,
,,Cool green haven,5,,Had not been to the gardens before and would have liked a lot longer to explore. Beautifully laid out and maintained. The trees are amazing day or night.,,
,,Stunning Super trees,5,,"We went in the evening to watch the sound and light show. It was amazing, a must see. The gardens tend to get very full in the evening so ensure that you have some time fully appreciate the sights.",,
,,RUDE STAFF,2,,Was there with my mum and my grandmother. There were so many people and a staff just pushed my grandmother over until she fell. I confronted her (i think her name starts with an,,
,,Great time with the family 馃槉,5,,"Went to the Cloud dome first and it was very cooling inside, the flowers were donned on the greenery beautifully. Then went to the Flower dome and saw the various decorative flower displays. Took lots of photos of the flowers and with the family. 馃尭鈽猴笍",,
,,Very beautiful place to visit!,5,,"My family and I had a great time here, the gardens really are beautiful and I have never seen anything like it!
The light show at night was wonderful, the music and lights looked amazing in the dark. All of my family thoroughly enjoyed it.
We would definitely visit again!",,
,,It is a beautiful place,5,,"The gardens by the bay was a beautiful experience
It is a must see
It is a half day visit
We gave the domes a skip Big visited the super tree grove for the light and sound show
That was just awesome.
Also my 4 year old had a blast as the place had a waiter park for toddlers and she had a lot of fun
Getting there is also easy . Actually getting any where in Singapore is super easy of your prepared to walk a little bit
This is for sure a half day thing and a must see",,
,,Mandatory pit-stop for anyone new in Singapore!,4,,Cloud forest is a must-visit. Flower dome - skippable unless you鈥檙e madly into flora and fauna. Wear comfy shoes as you gotta walk around a fair bit. Go around 3-4pm as the whole site visit won鈥檛 take more than 3-4hrs.,,
,,A must in Singapore,5,,We arrived mid afternoon. The entrance was free. We purchased tickets on the tour of the site for $8.00. This gives you get a good overview & cuts down walking to more distant parts of the gardens. We left the tour at the domes & purchased entry tickets for the domes for $28.00. There's a lot of walking to go through but domes thoroughly but how rewarding to see the amazing exhibits. About 6.00pm we looked for somewhere to eat. Some of the more well known chains were very crowded but we eventually found a place that did the job. Not a memorable meal by any means but enough to tide us over. Just outside the restaurant was a grassed area where we were able to stand & watch the 7.45pm light show. A quick stop at the souvenir shop & into a taxi & back to the hotel. I wouldn't have missed the attraction for the worlds but the above itinerary was enough for me. I was wilting by the time I reached the hotel. A worthwhile afternoon & highly recommended.,,
,,A disappointing visit,2,,Not much flowers and mostly are greens 鈥?wonder why it is called a flower dome when greens are more than the flowers. Some flowers were been damaged by visitors that its stalks had snapped and fell on the ground. Had seen a kid plucked a flower and was holding it. Some of the plants鈥?leaves are turning brown and looks dry at the cactus area 鈥?seems like these plants were not been maintained well anymore. Was not a good visit this time compared to the tulips mania and cherry blossom. Pretty sad with the visit to see that most of the plants were not in good shape anymore.,,
,,A good place to chill but be aware of the time limit and announcements,4,,"The flower dome was cool and refreshing. But during my visit, Cloud Forest was closed for maintenance (I am aware of this so it is okay). So make sure to check out any announcements before visiting. And make sure to queue for OCBC Skyway before 8.30pm(?) I didnt know there was a 'last entry' / time limit so I missed out on that one.",,
,,Perfect all-weather outing for the family,5,,Visit the lovely flower dome & cloud forest on rainy days cos its all sheltered. Visit the outdoor gardens and funtastic children鈥檚 garden on sunny days. Take a stroll down to satay by the Bay for dinner. Quite perfect for the family.,,
,,Great site,5,,Really nice place with a beautiful show at 7:45. Really recommend this place. It is great for small children as well,,
,,Great afternoon and night,5,,"Had a great half day here, you can walk around free just need to pay for access into the greenhouses. You must make your way back and sit in the trees for the light shows of which there are two an hour apart.",,
,,Worth visiting - once,3,,"When I told people I was intending to visit Singapore this was one of the places that was highly recommended. So despite my horticultural prowess peaking at running a mower over a lawn I decided to pay a visit.
We went on a Saturday morning, it was not overcrowded and the staff we encountered were helpful and pleasant.
In layman's terms this was a visit to two big green houses. The smell inside the domes is very pleasant and the aircon makes it a refuge from the intense Singapore heat. It took us just over an hour to walk around both domes. I'm sure some horticulturalists could get lost for hours in here but for us it was nothing more than a pleasant walk through the air conditioned greenery. I've been once and that will be enough for me.",,
,,Beautiful Place,5,,"Beautiful Place to Visit, Clean & Natural. We are enjoy our trip here, my children loved this place as well.",,
,,Unique and Impressive,5,,"A real must see while visiting Singapore. There鈥檚 nothing like it anywhere else, with huge indoor gardens and walkways, waterfalls and fascinating sights throughout.",,
,,A Wonderful Garden,5,,"It's a wonderful place for sightseeing, outdoor activities such as jogging, picnic, photography, and etc. The night view is even more attractive with the lights on. To see more plant varieties, do visit the Dome!",,
,,A great efforts to show nature has to offer,4,,A great investment and knowledge to grow flowers and plants and to good way to teach children to appreciate the beauty of the nature,,
,,Outing with friends and seniors,5,,"It鈥檚 been a long time since we last visited the flower dome. It is still as beautiful and fragrant as before. The variety of flowers change with the season and the fragrance of the air in the dome is just so nice. Great place to hangout and also to enjoy nature in a cool ambience, especially in the hot and humid Singapore.",,
,,Worth the look,4,,"Although a little speedy, this is worth a visit. Very unusual & the flower displays change regularly. The view & flowers in the larger of the greenhouses are fabulous. We have been twice & will go again!",,
,,Mesmerizing,5,,Visited twice on our short break. First time in the evening to see the sound and light show at the Supertrees which was delightful and then came back during the daytime to visit the garden and see the begonias inside. Blown away by how amazing the whole place is.,,
,,A must visit,5,,Stunning! Breathtaking! Serene! A must do in Singapore. The skywalk and the waterfall are amazing. It is much cheaper to do the two domes than one. Air conditioned. Even if you are not into gardens/plants- you will still love this place.,,
,,Best free show in town,5,,The light and sound show that starts every day after dark is not to be missed. We were in Singapore 5 days and saw the show twice it was so wonderful.,,
,,Veery nice!!!,5,,"The are two domes who are full of nature.. One is full of flowers and the other one has a waterfall. Very nice to see. We paid $28. If one buy through SG app you can save some dollars! One can go bynus or mrt both leave one just some mts from the entrance.
The entrance of the sky bridge one buy separatly, its at the moment 8 dollars. At 7.45pm starts the light show andin my opinion is nicer to seat on the ground and watch in from the floor but one can also be seen from the bridge..",,
,,Must visit for gardening enthusiasts,5,,"Most amazing indoor garden experiences ever! The night time sounds and lights show at the garden bay bridge was good. Overall fun experience, the dome gets darker after sunset and not easy to photograph. Other than that, loved every moment I spent there with the family!",,
,,Beautiful city garden,5,,What a beautiful place of tranquility in a busy bustling city. Try the restaurant inside one of the giant trees or walk the skywalk above the tee tops. Not to be missed,,
,,Highly recommeneded to spend time in th evening,4,,"If you are taking a taxi to Gardens by the bay, then avoid visiting the place during weekends. You can also take a walk from Marina Bay Sands shopping mall to the Gardens by the bay. The trail is excellent (provided the weather is good) Try to reach the Gardens before 7 PM if you want to enjoy the Super Tree sound and light show.",,
,,Artificial Gardens in middle of City,3,,"This is an artificial Garden smack in middle of the City. You are in awe of the man-made creation but lacks the effect and impact of a natural beauty and wilderness you get to see in other parts of world. Its very informative and kids love it. Wooden shapes of animals / birds are done very well and the entire garden is designed ascetically. Take a shawl / light jacket with you especially during summer, its very cold in the domes.",,
,,excellent place to visit,4,,"The Place is excellent to visit, one must not miss it. The facilities at the attraction of high standard",,
,,"Good, but not great",4,,"A tremendous undertaking with two vast domes and ersatz trees. All a bit monotonous and not until we had started did we appreciate that there was an Audio guide available - so the signage could be improved. But then we never saw anybody with an audio guide so perhaps not an essential.

Every view clogged by people doing selfies. Overall glad we went but frankly not stopped in our tracks 鈥?pleasant enough but one I would have to say is overrated.",,
,,Beautiful garden,4,,#NAME?,,
,,Always a highlight,5,,Gardens by the Bay are unmissable. Open all hours they accommodate jet lagged tourists perfectly. No visit to Singapore is complete without a visit here.,,
,,Brilliant a must see loaction,5,,"Singapore has spent hundreds of millions of dollars creating this incredible area. It has plants from just about everywhere in the world in magnificent garden settings, all airconditioned and under irrigation. It is definitely a must see if you are visiting Singapore.",,
,,Great place to spend the day,5,,"Beautiful venue to spend the day. Enjoyed the Skywalk in the Trees, Cloud Forest and evening light show. Lots of families taking photos. Plenty of places to grab some Tea, lunch or snacks. Wear comfortable shoes - lots of walking. Bridge takes you to Marina Bay Sands shopping as well.",,
,,Must see,5,,"You can spends hours upon hours down there... and we did. There are things to see and do everywhere. Check it out during the day, but don鈥檛 miss coming at night! When the Supertree Grove puts on there nightly light shows, it is like nothing you will see anywhere in the world! We went three times in two nights",,
,,Gardens,5,,Spectacular.Best value for Money.Light show at night was the best thing i have seen.Appreciated reentry stamp,,
,,Must do,5,,"Stunning gardens. Would recommend the
20 minute ride around the garden as it gives a brief description of each area. I would also recommend paying for the flower dome and cloud forest - worth the money. The light show was good but the taxi queue afterwards was not. Lots of people jumping the queue and security not policing it.",,
,,Wow Amazing Place,5,,"love this place, Lovely place for all age group, credit to all those who are maintain and develop for people, must visit this place when ever any one at singapore, easily any one can pass 3 to 4 hrs or more, amazing place.",,

,,Garden By the bay,5,,"just lovely place for the all the group, just shows how singapore has grown technologically. just dont miss evening show",,
,,Amazing gardens,5,,I visited these gardens during a short trip to Singapore. It is a must see attraction. The place as with all Singapore is meticulous and the organisation is of a very high standard. The displays are fantastic and the climate control makes the visit pleasent at all times of the year. There are educational areas for children. It is a must visit for those traveling to Singapore.,,
,,The One place you must visit in Singapore,5,,"As recommended in other reviews, we went here mid - late afternoon into the evening. I hadn't realised that essentially it is a free to enter attraction and you pay to enter each of the domes and the skywalk. However the sky domes are really worth the entrance fee. If you present your Singapore Airlines boarding card, you even save 10%.

The cloud dome takes your breath away with its amazing waterfall and walkways. The flower dome is absolutely beautiful, particularly with its special display of begonias which were running at the time, but this changes throughout the year.

We stayed for the short sound and light show in the Supertree grove at 7:45, which was really worth the wait, although get there 30 - 45 mins before the start time to ensure you get a good seat facing the tree with the restaurant at the top.

There are also a number of places to eat and drink from fine dining to McDonalds.",,
,,Must visit ...,5,,"What an amazing place. Although the entire Garden is great, we found the Flower Dome to be very refreshing, the vibrancy of the place is super",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"We purchased the full ticket, although it rained we got a shuttle to the gate, its well worth spending about 15 gbp to see. The gardens are beautiful and colourful. A lot of tourists however and can be very crowded when taking photos",,
,,One of the best attractions in Singapore,5,,"You would be amazed at how beautifully it is constructed. There are musical lighting shows in evening at 6.45, 7.45 and 8.45 MUST WATCH!
There's also Domes tickets for which you can buy on klook on discount it will take approx 2 hours to explore the rainforest dome will blow your mind with the variety of flowers and plants that flourish in rainforest",,
,,Massive and impressive construction,5,,One of the most memorable places in Singapore during my trip. I like the show at night even though they change the topic for the last time I visited. Viewing the whole city at night just like a small NYC,,
,,Didn鈥檛 know what to expect and was fascinated,5,,"I found myself in Singapore for the weekend so I looked at suggestions for what to do. Gardens by the bay came up. I looked for 30 seconds, said this looks interesting and decided to go. Really wasn鈥檛 sure what to expect. I went to the flower dome and the cloud forest. Both were fascinating combinations of man made art and the beauty of plants. I spent a couple hours between the two attractions and found the whole thing an afternoon well spent.",,
,,Garden by the bay,5,,"This is a very good place to see differnent kind of trees, plants & flowers.... you can visit all three places (gardens by the bay, cloud forest & OCBC skyway). Over the counter the tickets to these parks are expensive compared to online & local travel agents. If you can bargain you can get a good deal from local agents...",,
,,A Very Different Experience!,5,,Temperature controlled. Exquisite Plants from all over the globe. Beautifully landscaped. Its a pleasure to see these Human made wonder. The Cloud Forest was the best part of the Gardens by the Bay. The whole Set up is amazing. Highly Recommended.,,
,,Amazing,5,,"Visited here on a day when one of the two Domes was closed So check before to make sure both are open or come back. Much preferred the cloud forest, bigger and more exciting. Flower garden was still very good. The night show is very good, lie down underneath the big tree in the super tree grove. Satay by the bay is a good place for dinner or lunch, cheap with lots of variety of stalls. On top of Marina barrage is a great place to watch the sunset over downtown Singapore and can also see out over Singapore harbour",,
,,Special Gardens,5,,"This was our second visit here and most enjoyable again . Different time of the years so all very new and delightful.
We enjoyed a trolley ride around the outside gardens this time and it was well worth it. Don't leave Singapore without a visit here .",,
,,Take a walk through after sunset for a spectacular view,4,,We walked through both of the glass houses at night and the lighting effects were amazing. Well worth a look if you are in Singapore.,,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,Have seen the night show on a previous occasion but not the Flower Dome or Cloud Forest until this visit. Definitely a must see as both domes are spectacular and it is easy to understand why it is one of the top ten gardens in the world.,,
,,Amazing!!,5,,"Visited the place with tickets bought thru Trip Advisor / Aviator.
Important to know that the place is very big, but the 2 paid locations admit entrance until 8 pm, so allow at least una hour to visit each...
The flower dome and the cloud forest are equally interesting and beautiful. The flower dome changes the topic and exposition often.
And the free area is amazing as well. Tons of walking, so wear comfortable shoes.
In order to walk by the high bridges there is a small entrance fee and the last access is at 8pm.
The nightly music and lights show I saw in the trees (free) was at 8:45pm and for 15 mins, absolutely amazing!",,
,,Amazing,5,,Spectacular even on a rainy day! Our whole family thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The staff were extremely friendly & very considerate of travelling families & limited the wait times. Can鈥檛 wait to come back & explore the gardens on a sunny day,,
,,Worth it for the views alone,4,,"This is a great place to spend an afternoon with attractive gardens, sculptures, a selection of cheap eating outlets and the famous artificial trees and sky walkway. If you don't fancy walking too much take the tram. You can get on and off as many times as you like and it will also take you back to the MTR when it is time to go back to your hotel.",,
,,"Good in the day, better at night",4,,Very well done and insetting displays of plants including a cloud rainforest. Make sure you also watch the light display at night.,,
,,Fantastic view,4,,"We had relaxing time in the afternoon. You must spare 3-4 hours to visit all the places.

OCBC skywalk is great but you can surely skip it if you have been to Singapore flyer.

I recommend to watch the light show by watching the trees from downstairs instead of going to skywalk.

Relax under the trees and watch the beautiful light show around 6-7pm.",,
,,This is another must see in Singapore,5,,"This is another must see in Singapore, the gardens are fantastic and are constantly attended so they are looking their best, the do close the domes for regular maintenance, so check before going if they are both going to be open on the day of your visit.",,
,,Amazing place. Dont miss it!,5,,In Love with this magic garden! Everything is so beautiful and well looked after. Evening light show runs at 19:45 and 20:30 and is free.Lots of staff to see and you can spend there whole day. Must visit!,,
,,Astonishing!,5,,It`s the result of hard work and intelligent engineers. It`s the proud of this wonderful country. It`s amazing and worth all the money and effort.,,
,,Disappointed,5,,We visited the gardens by the bay and took the 20 minute audio tour to save our legs . We found the gardens very nice but have seen better at Q gardens in london,,
,,Amazing display,5,,This is a must see location in Singapore. Get there later in the afternoon about 4 & pay for the shuttle bus to have a look around. Then do the 2 domes. Have dinner Athen watch the spectacular light show at 8. Excellent night,,
,,wonderful day in wonderland,5,,"we took the mrt to bayfront station . There are well marked signs to gbtb . there was slight drizzle when we reached there . Enter gbtb you are trasnsferred to a different world altogether . You shoud take a moment to think about the effort planning and dedication which has gone into the making of this wonderful indoor gardens,photo spots galore in this place .you can visit this place during day also as it is indoors and air conditioned. Allow 3 hours to stroll leisurely through both the domes . After visiting the domes and around late evening one can visit the outdoor gardens which are beautifully landscaped and equally magnificient like the indoor one .",,
,,Easy Walk Wonderful Flora,4,,"Take the opportunity to see some of the unique plants of Asia. Clearly a lot of money has been spent to achieve this garden oasis. I remember when the Marina complex was being constructed in 1991 and to see it now is a remarkable transformation. Spend sometime appreciating the sculpture. Can't say I thought much of the 'floating baby"" however. The description tended to waffle on about what is simply a floating baby....other than this it is a great experience and must to see in Singapore.",,
,,Simply Amazing,5,,We only had one full day in Singapore and so glad that we choose to come here. We only did the inside domes but this was simply amazing and well worth the 28 Singapore dollars to get in (to wonder around the outside grounds is free). The first dome is full of different garden displays from around the word and the second dome is like one big rain forest with a waterfall and huge sky walkway. I wish that we had had more time here to have a look around the outside as well. Also has a great gift shop here.,,
,,Worth the visit,4,,"Ensure to catch the light show at 7:30p. Large variety of different activities, good for with kids, adults a great stroll",,
,,One not to Miss,5,,"could have spent more time than we did (legs/feet ready to fall off) such a beautiful and functional place, everywhere we went there was something to see, spent most of my time saying Gost! or OMG, will come back some day",,
,,Gardens by the Bay,4,,Super trees phenomenon is unique lighting with music show is marvellous you find yourself in the new world it seems that heaven is on earth It is new arrival in Singapore those visited earlier 4-5 years back can go again to this wonderful country,,
,,A must see in singapore,5,,The gardens have themes regularly and makes an effort to give the experience of being in that place. Recently they had japan Sakura and then tulips. It鈥檚 amazing experience.,,
,,Wow - a must see in Singapore during the day & night!,5,,"The Gardens by the Bay was amazing! It was such a unique attraction in a very metropolitan city. I visited here mid-day and took the elevator up to the bridge walk. Singapore is definitely hot, but there was a breeze once you were on the bridge walk. I then went back during the evening to see the light show. I would recommend seeing it both during the day and night!",,
,,Xmas date,5,,Lovely atmosphere and picturesque background. The theme changes regularly too. Will come again & well recommended for a brisk walk or family or couple leisure walk.,,
,,Lovely place to visit - mind the crowd and stay for the light show,5,,"Within the domes you鈥檒l get to see a great variety of plants - all very well maintained and curated! Look out for the sculptures that live among the plants too. They come in all sizes, just like the plants.

I recommend that you come either really early or at about 4 or 5pm on a weekday to avoid the crowd. However it鈥檚 unlikely that you鈥檒l avoid crowds altogether. That鈥檚 the case with most tourist attractions. I would recommend that you also stay for the music and light show. It鈥檚 held outside the domes, among the super trees.",,
,,A peace of paradise in airconditioned comfort,5,,A great way to spend a couple of hours out of the heat. Not only is the architecture spectacular but the diverse range of plants and landscaping are unique under the domes. The solar trees and the surrounding park are also nice to view.,,
,,Good Scenic Experience,5,,You can experience good scenic experience at Gardens by the Bay with very diverse flower and plant types. It is a good walk and there might be some activities held there at special times such as lighting exhibition during the Christmas period - its really good to especially night time with your loved ones. Gardens by the Bay is an easy walk from Marina Bay Sands and the Marina Barrage (where you can have a picnic with your loved ones).,,
,,good place,5,,i came here for the night view. there's no entrance fee required except for the parking fee. usually it will be crowded at night.,,
,,Awesome experience,5,,Extremely beautiful and well kept is a must for every traveller even if u r not interested in plants. Luckily visited during flower festival and was amazed by the colours and variety of flowers. Ideal place to take loads of pictures. Waterfall in cloud forest will take ur breath away and refresh u for ur travels forward,,
,,Beautiful Gardens,4,,"Beautiful Gardens by I would say the Cloud Forest with it's ""waterfall"" is the better of the two. Leave that one to last",,
,,Words can't do this attraction justice!,5,,"This is one of the most incredible complexes I have ever seen! It includes 2 immense glass biodomes completely devoid of any internal support 鈥?the Flower Dome is the largest all glass greenhouse on earth and the Cloud Forest Dome features the world鈥檚 tallest indoor waterfall 鈥?鈥渟upertrees鈥?linked by a walkway 7 stories above the ground, Heritage Gardens which tell the history of Singapore, a sculptural rock garden, a floral clock and 40 sculptures 鈥?some monumental 鈥?scattered around its 250 acres.",,
,,Great place to visit,5,,Well worth the visit to see Gardens by the Bay. Interesting and beautiful displays of flowers and nature. A great example of how Singapore merges nature with its city.,,
,,The Lightshow!,5,,"We stayed in Singapore for 4 nights in April 2017 as part of our honeymoon.
We visited Gardens By the Bay at night as we were told by our Taxi driver to visit then due to it being cooler and nightly lighted etc.
We had no idea until we got there that there is actually a light show on every evening. I won't go into too much detail about the show as do not want to ruin it for anyone but will say that it was amazing and not at all what we expected.
We absolutely loved it, so much so that it actually made me emotional. Such a brilliant experience, Singapore is one of my favourite cities for many reasons and Gardens By the Bay is one of them!",,
,,Worth a visit.,5,,Go in the evening around 4.30pm. See the Comes first and then go onto the light show. Adult kids and teenager as well as the pensioners in our family tribe loved it.,,
,,After hours visit,5,,We visited here late after the place was closed. It was great as it was quite and we still got to see the amazing trees.,,
,,Totally amazing.,5,,Totally amazing it was like being in a different world. I would highly recommend putting this on your list of places to visit.,,
,,Nice Place to visit,4,,"Travelled to Singapore with family, Really enjoyed at the Bay Area, beautiful view, specially at night, really appreciate the way Singapore Preserves the Natural habitat.",,
,,Review,5,,"A truly amazing place. You get to see a variety of plants, from all over the world under one roof. The most noticeable fact is that the temperature indoors is way cooler than outside.

A very quiet place as such to pass time. Kinda pricey, but price doesn't really matter when you are out on a tour",,
,,A lovely walk along the lake and those trees are impressive!,5,,"This is yet another example of the Singaporeans ingenuity and greening process. The massive supertrees towering above the lake. Soon they will be completely green, with the clematis and other climbing plants reaching the metal boughs. I'll have to come back in a few years' to see how they look then. The other feature that caught my eye...you can't miss it...is the massive floating baby. A beautiful massive statue.",,
,,Beautiful place to visit,5,,"My husband and I visited late June 2018 and loved the gardens. We also went into the Cloud Dome (S$16 each) and it was fabulous. The plants and flowers were just beautiful, and the waterfall was wonderful. Walls of plants everywhere. We actually did an audio tour in a trolley around the gardens first at a very reasonable price of S$8 each.

A great place to visit and highly recommended.",,
,,A must see,5,,"Fantastic gardens the cloud dome and flower dome are very well done, so much to see. Just a short walk up the road is Satay by the Bay worth a visit also and you may see the otters on the way.",,
,,Experience of nature in a buzzing city.,5,,"We walked there from Marina Bay Sands - in light rain but the beauty and tranquility experienced was a super. These -people are just surprising me more every day as this is a real gem of Singapore. Definitely my #1 place to visit in Singapore. The detail, layout an plants with lots of water sets an environment to find peace and relax. In the busy city. Dont skip this one.",,
,,Closed for Filming,1,,"Went to the Cloud Forest at Gardens by the Bay at 8am this morning to take pictures but was chased away by some minders who told us the whole area was closed for filming by drone. Judging from the fact the OCBC Skyway doesn鈥檛 open until 9am but it had people (obviously fake tourists) doing different things, like taking wedding photos and just standing around like cows so they could film them from the drone, I assume it was for their own publicity.

Checked the website but there was no mention that this main attraction for the Gardens by the Bay would be closed for filming today. Now that鈥檚 bad publicity.",,
,,Boring Tourist Trap,2,,"There are not too much to see in Singapur, so they buid this Gardens to have something to show.... but still not worth making a trip here and pay the high cost of the entrance...",,
,,Gardens by bay- An Oasis in city,5,,"A place that offers so much to see under one roof with varieties of flowers & cactus. It's a showpiece of horticulture and garden artistry that presents the plant kingdom in a whole new way, entertaining while educating visitors.

Entry price allows access to Flower Dome and Cloud forest which can be purchased online in case you get a good deal or coupon. Tickets to OCBC Skyway walk are sold at counter as its subject to weather condition [I missed it due to rains :( ]

I went on Saturday during holiday season which was a crowded day and still could easily get to spend time admiring all those flowers as its managed properly until some tourist just want to take numbers of pictures.

You might have to queue up to reach on top floor at cloud forest though waiting time is not more than 10-15 mins.

Once you are done with all the above I suggest you can get rest or take a walk towards Helix bridge and come back at late evening to admire Light show in Gardens by bay. Just get a re-entry stamped.",,
,,Walk In the park.,5,,"It was just a casual walk along the promenade and we decided take a peak I side park little further and it made my day, both of us awwed vy every thing around us and for awhile we felt like we are not in Singapore. Perfect location for all types of people. Certainly brings you closer to nature and calms one's mind instantly..",,
,,Spectacular event,5,,Great afternoon visiting the flower & Cloud domes with light show to finish at 8:00pm. Worth the price of admission and some great pictures that won't do the show justice,,
,,best pace in singapore,5,,"If you only have time to visit just ONE major attraction in Singapore, then Gardens by the Bay is THE place to go. And I believe that most Singaporeans will agree with me.",,
,,Magnificent Gardens and light show of the Super Trees was truly inspiring,5,,Gardens on the Bay was really great and it is truly wonderful what they have done. The whole area has been beautifully upgraded and has exciting venues. The light show with music in the evening at the Super Trees was incredible and inspiring. I would highly recommend a visit.,,
,,Worth every penny,5,,"We live in Singapore and visit Gardens by thr Bay often. We have two children ages 4 and 6.

You can visit Gardens by the bay and walk around outside for free. There is a fun splash pad and tree house area that our children love. Make sure you pack a bathing suit, because you're not permitted in the water unless you're wearing one.

The cloud forest is amazing, we love the waterfall and it always amazes our guests we bring here.

The garden dome is busy on weekends, but pretty empty during week days. If you go during the week, pack a sweater because the A.C. can be cold! We love the changing displays. In December, we loved the ""Santa"". He looked like he came straight out of a European folktale.

The super tree view is great and we've heard the evening show is wonderful...but our children are always too tired to be out that late.",,
,,A must...,5,,Even if your are not into plants or gardening etc you have to appreciate the sheer magnitude of what has been accomplished here. Beautifully set out and immaculately presented what a great overall experience.,,
,,Day at Gardens by the Bay,5,,"I went there expecting to spend an hour or so and ended staying all day, just beautiful and amazing. I really enjoyed this place and saw as much as I could. I recommend this as a must see in Singapore",,
,,Disney Style Botanic Garden,3,,"One of those showcase projects for which Singapore is famous. Everything created artificially this century.

Two large greenhouses showcasing flora from two different climates. Visitors need to pay separately to go into each greenhouse.

Another showcase items, some tall artificial ""Trees"". Again, you need to pay to walk along the bridge joining them.

In keeping with the image they're trying to project, there is a restaurant, ""Pollen"" attached to the greenhouses where a set dinner will set you back about S$200 per head.

Clearly targeted at tourists. Locals will likely visit the garden once out of curiosity.

If Botany and local flora be your interesst, a much better bet is the 150 year old Botanic Gardens opposite the US Embassy. All natural!",,
,,Great light show,5,,Amazing trees in the day and great light show in the evening and all for free. There is a tree walk for $8 which I advise to do during the day as it does get crowded for the nightly light shows.,,
,,Singapore Icon,5,,"If you come to Singapore it's worth a wander through the gardens. There is lots to see & do for free as well as the paid attractions. We even brought our own lunch & had a picnic on the grass.
The kids waterpark can be fun for little kids to escape the heat but it is open so suncream is needed.
We made a visit during the day & then returned at night for the light show which was pretty cool.",,
,,I wish if i could live in their secret garden forever,5,,"Both domes & super trees are impressive, amazing and Wonderful.
S锛勶紥8 for two domes is money well spent. The cloud forest reminded me Laputa ~ Castle in the sky, and it is cool (the temperture wise) I'm glad i had a big scarf. Flower dome has themed gardens like Alice in the wonderland, octopus garden etc. I love them all. I have to go back, i missed the laser show!",,
,,A Highlite of Singapore,5,,This is a must see it is fantasic. To see it all you have to allow at least 4 to 5 hours. It is a large area outside so pay for the open air little bus you will see heaps. The two inside exibits (Cloud Forrest) are just breathtaking and a MUST SEE.,,
,,How to see the light show low cost,5,,We just wanted to see the Supertree Grove light show at 7:45-8:00pm. With a hop on hop off bus ticket the Yellow line stops at Marina Bay and gives an audio description along the way. That is good for daylight gardens viewing however their last bus is 6pm at Suntec City Duck and Hippo tour centre. If you are too late then from Suntec go to the Esplanade underground and get a Circle line to Promenade then change to platform B for Bayfront station closest to the Gardens. There is a Gardens shuttle inside the grounds if needed. After the show at Bayfront station we took the Downtown line directly to Fort Canning station closest to Novotel and Clarke Quay.,,
,,Worth the effort,5,,Even if it is humid make the effort and walk around. It is about 5km around the gardens but with plenty of seating and rest areas. Pay the entrance fee and go inside the buildings. It is a must visit,,
,,Great depiction of Nature!,4,,It's a really nice place to walk around and get lost among the flowers! I was on a school trip and I can confirm that this is one of the attractions everyone has enjoyed!,,
,,A Garden which is unique,5,,Nice atmosphere to stroll in this beautiful garden. It would great if you can see when the sun setting and the lighting starts to glow. Really worth a visit.,,
,,Nice place,5,,Really happy to visit this nice place. Love lights & plants. Must bring my family and friends to visit again.,,
,,great night view,5,,been here on 8.30 pm. nearly close. but. really love to see the light on this place. you can take walk and bring your family here. its really near marina bay sands,,
,,Good to experience rain forest within City...,4,,"Just after the marina bay sands skypark, we walked our way to the opposite garden which is called gardens by the bay. The garden houses multiple attractions including a water front with fountain and huge metal insect structures. We could easily spend about an hour sitting near the water front and relaxing ourselves. There is a transportation facility (charged) to move within the park from entrance to the cloud forest, flower dome. I would suggest a leisure walk to experience the garden.We had cartoon network theme activity centre during our visit and kids enjoyed the fun activities in the garden. Good park to spend leisure.",,
,,Simply Amazing,5,,Would highly recommend visiting here. Beautifully maintained and a peaceful place to walk and enjoy nature in the middle of Singapore.,,
,,Luxury,4,,"It is close to Chinatown, 1 time by MRT.
huge garden with modern design. It is great to visit in the evening cause you can see the light of giant trees.
If you wish to see the flowers, recommend to come in the day time, during day time, they provide buggy for transportation.",,
,,Don't miss this when in Singapore,5,,"I have been to GBTB twice now and always find it very rewarding.This time I was able to bring along a friend who has not been there before which made it even more special.
This is an amazing feat of architecture and horticulture combined and the whole experience is something that should definitely not be missed.
Visited June 3rd 2018",,
,,A Mystical place to immerse yourself in cool and beautiful surroundings.,5,,Take the time to saunter through both the Gardens and Cloud land Canyon. Enjoy the beauty and take a break from the heat! Very welcome oasis.,,
,,Wonderful wonderful...,5,,"Two reasons to visit Gardens by the Bay. One is to go during the day, then for something spectacular number two, a night visit is a must, fantastic light show like nothing else. enjoy the walk through the gardens & witness the magnificent way the plants are held onto the structures.",,
,,Interesting Visit to the Cloud Forest,5,,Visited both the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. Found the Cloud Forest more interesting as there was a very high indoor water fall. First thing to do is to quickly queue and get on the lift to the top of the Cloud Forest. Easy walk down. Views are different in the day and at night. Best to visit around 6 pm to catch the different views.,,
,,A Singapore Highlight,5,,"This site is a ""must see"" for any new traveller to Singapore and most likely for any return traveller. Brilliant, beautiful, amazing and the list could go on.

This was our first visit to Singapore since 2005 and so much has changed. If possible, try and go for the night-time light experience. Things to consider are possible long queues (we had to wait for an hour as we shuffled forward to get to the lift that would take us to the sky walk), time on the sky walk is limited to around 15 minutes and unless you are comfortable with heights, you may need to reconsider getting close to the edge - we had to help a young man who was ""on all fours"" trying to get back to the lift.

If heights don't frighten you, kick back and enjoy your time.",,
,,gardens by the bay,4,,"this is a very grand location in santosa island, singapore. The beauty of the same is excellent and beyond words, it covers a large area near the beach. the night lighting is a real feast to ones eyes. coloured lights dancing to the music is wonderful. it operates two times in the evening.",,
,,Simply Outstanding,4,,It is a very nice place for nature lovers to visit. The man made park houses an extremely rich and beautiful collection of flaura. A must visit.,,
,,A must see,5,,"We were short of time before our flight so we took a taxi to the gardens
We got onto the trolley for $8 each and saw all the gardens in 20min
We then went into the flower dome at a cost of $16 each
Well worth the money
A must see in Singapore but allow half a day not the 2hrs we had",,
,,beauitful garden in the centre of the business hub,4,,visit the cooled conservatories next to the biggest garden in the centre of the business hub in Singapore. great place to visit with young children. pleasant and relaxing to walk through the wide variety of plants in manmade nature.,,
,,A must see while in Singapore,5,,"Whether you live or are visiting Singapore, a stop at Gardens by the Bay is a must see stop. The indoor beauty and pleasant air conditioning makes for a wonderful day of touring. It is a great options with kids and when the weather is inclement or hot. My recommendation would be to see both the Cloud Forest and the Flower Garden.",,
,,"Beautiful Building, great area for a walk or a visit with friends or kids",4,,"The Garden by the Bay is a great complex, well organised, well connected and very impressive. The space outside with the super trees and the plants is very nice but the 2 domes are really nice both architectonically as well as for their content. Strongly advised.",,
,,Great place to visit - a must to visit,4,,"This is a very unique forests in 2 domes, air-conditioned; one is humid and one is dry. Amazing experience to see the forests within these 2 domes. Try not to miss this when in Singapore. Take MRT (train) and alight and Bayfront MRT station; its just about 110-15 mins walk to the Garden.",,
,,Do yourself a favour!!!,5,,A must see for anyone visiting Singapore. Make sure you give yourself enough time to see the Gardens during the day and at night for the light show. We also went to both garden domes which were both excellent. Highly recommend.,,
,,Garden by the bay,5,,"Went there very often. My most favorite time is evening, about 5-6 pm. Watch the sun set and the skyline. Very beautiful. Enjoy sitting by the river, watching ppl passing, joggers, walkers and of course mingled with tourists. Must visit place in Spore.",,
,,If you like manmade nature,3,,"It's a nice place if you like manmade nature 鈥?enjoy nature while indoors in a controlled environment. Unfortunately, it's not my cup of tea.",,
,,CLOUD FOREST,4,,Good = pleasant and relaxing to walk through the beauty of the surroundings and wide variety of plants and faunas. The water falls fantastic and unique . A must visit for Tourists and Locals to GARDENS BY THE BAY!,,
,,SuperTrees at night are spectacular,5,,"Beautiful gardens, amazing landscaping and ingenious structures - SuperTrees, Skywalk, Flower Dome. One of the best gardens I've been to.",,
,,"The Cloud Forest, Gardens By The Bay",5,,"It is a must-see attraction for both locals and tourists!
With 7 floors of flora and fauna to view and admire, a cool place to relax, too.
Waterfall cascading from the 7th floor, beautiful plant walls and many varied orchids species.
The beautiful crystal mountains formed by many years of erosion.
The magnificent wood carvings from camphor wood.
There are many eateries around to enjoy your meal and to rest your tired feet.",,
,,Don't miss this,5,,"This is well worth the effort to visit. I did not buy a ticket online beforehand and the queue only took about 10 minutes so no worries there. The two domes to visit are both excellent with each having different highlights. The begonias are dazzling. The staff were extremely attentive and helpful. I dropped an item from my bag without noticing and when reporting it, the staff had it found and returned to me within minutes even though I had moved on outside the viewing area. Be sure to wander through the external gardens and displays as well and takes lots of pictures with the Marina Bay Sands in the background.",,
,,FANTASTIC,5,,"No one does it like Singapore, wonderful experience....what a show. worth seeing, ""infact a ""must"" on anyones bucket list.",,
,,amazing tour,5,,"so beautiful place to visit , you will be amazed with everything you will see specially thr flowering plants exotic and native of some countries are being displayed and propagated at a controlled environment to suit the nature of the organism. So informative to children and adult, even the shows about our future and climate change effect to our lives. All I can say is try visiting this place to experience the beauty of Gods creation as give to human kind that we must treasure and love.",,
,,World class one of its kind Garden by the bay.,5,,"This is a must visit site if you are in Singapore. Awesome design and amazing range of plants, trees and flowers from all over the world. The Cloud forest and Flower dome are fantastic and is air-conditioned. The gift shop has a huge range of interesting and nice souvenirs to pick up. The man made waterfall, beautiful landscape and environment certainly made this visit worthwhile. Get ready enough of space for your photo taking. There are also nice eating outlets around and a kids water park for kids to enjoy the fun.",,
,,Come only for Christmas,3,,Nothing much interesting only during christmas it seems to be better with those lightings inside deco........the rest..waste of time and money,,
,,A great place for family bonding,5,,"Brought a group of children with their families to the Gardens as part of school outing. The children had a wonderful time exploring the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest where they saw the small man made waterfall, walked on the sky bridge and marvelled at the colourful sight of different flowers put together. The most fun was at the outdoor waterplay where the children played for almost an hour without stopping! Definitely a good place for a family day out :)",,
,,Amazing,5,,Well worth a visit. Spectacular gardens and very well set up. The variety of flowers are amazing. Gift shops have some lovely gifts to fir friends back home. Kids water park was free and a HUGE hit. Well done Singapore such an amazing tourist attraction.,,
,,Gracious Waterfront Destination,4,,"Some quick thoughts: It is difficult for a destination to appeal to visitors without alienating locals; somehow, Gardens by the Bay (GBTB) manages to pull it off. Here, camera-wielding (selfie-taking) tourists pose against the expanse of the Marina Bay waters, the hulking height of a multi-storey, manmade waterfall and the iconic spaceship-like structure of Marina Bay Sands built by casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, while locals like me linger in the tropical gardens and take in the familiar smells of the sun-heated seas and Satay smoke. GBTB succeeds because it has nature (not jungle nature, more manicured nature), is run well by the hawk-eyed Singapore government, and is close to amenities. The subway is nearby, and urbanites could quickly dive back into the air-conned familiarity of Gucci- and LV-living at Marina Bay Shopping Centre or the latest exhibits at the ArtScience Museum when they weary of the tropical heat. Anyone less than romantic would say GBTB merely adorns the Marina Bay area, whose primary purpose is to double-up Singapore's business district and secure the nation's fresh-water supplies, and he would be absolutely right. But there is no disputing the great job GBTB has made of its ancillary role within a mercantile context, thus securing its place as a premier destination for tourists and locals.",,
,,Beautiful,4,,"Was in Singapore for work and decided to check this out before travelling back to the UK. It鈥檚 pretty inexpensive to get in although a bit frustrating the you have to buy tickets for the trees in a different place. The greenhouses were incredible and it was just beautiful to walk around and enjoy some air conditioning away from the hot humidity of the outside. I would highly recommend visiting here, it鈥檚 perfect for family鈥檚 and solo travellers.",,
,,Absolutly fantastic,5,,First of all we found Singapore amazing. The Gardens just added that wow factor. So peaceful and relaxing. The lights dance was surreal. We enjoyed a srink at the bar and admired the view. We are forever in love with Singapore,,
,,Perfect place to chill,5,,"We spent our last night here, entrance was free. It was a nice and perfect place to relax and chill after all day walk. Light show with known music from different countries. It was a great experience.",,
,,Superb Place,5,,Great place to spend a morning. Large gardens which you can see and roam around for free. Very well organised and maintained. Have two environments having flowers of cold environment and one having a water fall and cloud effects,,
,,Amazing experience,5,,"For me, it was like being in a science fiction movie in which nature grows in huge spaceships. Fantastic mixture of nature and innovative architecture. Worth a visit!!",,
,,Excellent gallery,5,,Large gardens which you can see and roam around for free. Very well organised and maintained. Have two galleries having flowers of cold environment and one having a water fall and cloud effects,,
,,Great if you love long walks!,5,,I went there at all times of the day and I would say during sunset time would be the best because of food at Satay By The Bay and the beautiful view of the place in general because of golden hour. Do also try out the OCBC skyway and watch the light shows at either 745pm or 845pm daily!,,
,,Top of the list.,5,,"We are frequent visitors to the gardens and have watched it evolve over time, into a beautiful place to spend the day. Besides the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome, the outdoor garden areas, from the domes to the Marina Barrage, have been well designed. Don't miss them. Quirky and innovative sculptures both in and out of the domes are dotted everywhere. The domes can be quite noisy, though, when crowded with families and selfie-stick weilders. It would be a good legacy for the domes, if visitors would go away with a resolve to do something for the environment.",,
,,Great,5,,Unbelievable inspiration and done. The flowers and nature collection is awesome. But how they did and manage it is unbelievable.,,
,,Lovely,5,,Had great morning here. Exhibits were beautiful especially the begonias. Well worth the money. There must be a huge amount of work put into the place. Very impressive,,
,,Gardens that inspire,5,,Gardens by the bay is just an incredible place to visit. The super trees are an ingenious way to inspire other countries to become more sustainable with natures resources in a way that nutures the environment. Excellent displayscand lovely gardens to walk through. Love the domes!,,
,,Spectacular day and night,5,,"Arrive afternoon, stay for light and sound, perfect. The domes are lovely, plenty to see and enjoy. The theatrette is worth seeing too- in the dome.",,
,,Extraordinary garden,5,,"It such an honour to be able to witness the flower soma and the cloud forest, it鈥檚 such an magnificent experience for me and my fam",,
,,Good discount for Friends of the Gardens,4,,Friends of the Gardens 50% off this June holidays was a good way to get us to make plans to return to the Gardens again in the upcoming school holidays.,,
,,Magnificent!,5,,"The Gardens by the bay are a must visit for everyone. You can spend as much time as you like and the Gardens are free to enter.
There are fees to pay for entering the flower domes and the sky walk which are very beautiful.
You can access by day or night when everything is lit up with beautiful lights.
There is also an eatery serving various different dishes which isn't expensive.",,
,,Nice light show,4,,One of the best places to spend a beautiful evening with friends and family. The light show is good. Reach around 4pm so as to see to good spots by walk and reach the super tree around 7.15pm to get a good spot to watch the light show.,,
,,Outstanding,5,,"We visited during the day but later that night drove past and they looked awesome. During the day was great, plenty to see and do. Super clean and will definitely be back for a night visit. A must do in Singapore.",,
,,Over rated,2,,It was very crowded and tiring.. Can much do without seeing it Also no exit signs provided Poor management,,
,,Air conditioned garden,4,,A stroll in the air conditioned garden in the tropical Singapore is a good way to hide from the heat. Theme in flower dome will change so visitor will be in for pleasant surprise during each visit. A great spot for photography of the city skyline.,,
,,Pretty lights,4,,"The night show is really quite pretty. You have to get there early for a good spot. A bit more signage would help so you knew which ones form tbe actuall light show as we akong with many others were on the wrong side when it started. Wd did get to see 3/4 of it and it was well done. The river light show is much better!
I would hate to be at either when really busy.",,
,,Beautiful,4,,Absolutely beautiful..the whole park is magical..highlight of our trip..best to go mid morning to beat the heat and tourists. Very easy to get around..,,
,,Amazing experience,5,,"Can spend a good few hours here, there's so much to see! Wonderful experience would highly recommend!",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"A beautiful place, especially at night. It's a ""don't miss"". A lot of ground to cover so you may need more than one visit. A must see.",,
,,Beautiful and an easy way to spend an afternoon,5,,"I am astounded that such beautiful and well maintained gardens are free to the public, but they are, so we should enjoy them!
On my first trip, the skywalk was closed due to storms, but I was able to go up on the second go, and it was a fun walk with a lovely view.
The rest of the park is just wonderful for wandering around and thinking.",,
,,Disappointing,3,,Came here as one of the top attractions for Singapore but was disappointed. Very artificial and expensive.,,
,,Lives up to the name of garden city,4,,"I visited this place to see the domes near the gardens. Even this place is a very picturesque one. It had exhibitions going on. This place is a very good picnic spot. Also, try to visit this place at night as you do not want to miss to light show as it is amazing to watch. You also can do a skywalk by paying 8SGD, which allows to walk through the flower pillars at a height.",,
,,Huge cultivated gardens,5,,"Huge gardens created on reclaimed land in Marina Bay. Beautifully and tastefully cultivated. You could spend an entire day here, visiting the different sections, and there are activities for all ages.",,
,,Beaiful gardens,5,,"The place is clean and nice, we took many pictures and relaxed at the park, and late at night we watched the light show.",,
,,Beautiful Gardens in Singapore,5,,We spent an afternoon at the Gardens by the Bay. It was well worth it and if I return to Singapore I would certainly visit it again.,,
,,Magnificent gardens.,5,,"What a beautiful place to visit. So nice, so peaceful, so clean.
No trips to Singapore should be without a visit to this beautiful gardens situated behind the Marina Bay Sands.
When there we took a short tour around the gardens in a little bus which was well worth it otherwise you would miss seeing some beautiful sights. Oh so pretty.",,
,,Check the schedule first !,4,,"We were disappointed because when we were there the cloud forest was closed because of monthly maintenance. When we asked the staff, they said will be open on the next day but we don't have time because already have plan to visit Sentosa Island. My suggestion is if you wanna go there just check the schedule first if it's on monthly maintenance or available to visit.",,
,,AWESOME,4,,one must go here. garden by the Bay is so beautiful..i just loved the evening spend there. what an amazing light and sound show.,,
,,Very Impressive,5,,We had the advantage of a local friend touring us around. Although only created in 2012 it feels a lot older and established. Many things to see and enjoy without paying for the major attractions. Well worth doing it all. Great escape from the city.,,
,,Unique!,5,,"We have never seen a garden like this. An excellent example of Singaporean architecture that is exceeded by the plants within. There are waterfalls, rainforest mists, tree top walks and much more. The plays are superb and appear to have been there for many years. We spent a lot more time there than we thought and our young daughter was thoroughly engaged.

Well,worth a visit",,
,,Big things with little to no surprises,4,,Gardens by the bay is one of the iconic structure in world it is mesmerising and beautiful but yes A BIG BUT too much crowded and too much noise made this area little uncomfortable people visiting are should be told to be quite and kids of what I say they shout and touches the flowers even soundboard said not to do so illiterate parents I love to visit this play again and again but it needs to be quite,,
,,An impressive visual spectacle/experience,5,,"Took in the light show - twice - a delightful sound and light show. Imagine being in the forest in Avatar.

The two biospheres are impressive as well. Thoroughly enjoyed the creative juxtaposition of the glass domes, city lights, flowers and plants and sculptures.

A must-see!",,
,,Family vacation in sg,5,,This is my nth time to visit sg and gardens by the bay is another exceptional place to see or visit. My family and grandchildren enjoyed all the views they see and everything is really amazing! My grandchildren cant be stopped in telling their experiences in sg.,,
,,Very Pretty.,5,,"Walked from Vivo City Mall using the covered moving walkway over to the Gardens (a lot of walking involved, make sure you stay hydrated). Access via the Marina Bay Sands.Alternately, you can go via the Metro. Beautiful Gardens to explore, themed areas, ponds, bathrooms along the way. Food available also. Did not go into the domes, but you can see inside.",,
,,Cute music,5,,"I like this place. It's pretty spacious and even if it's just artificial, you won't see something like this anywhere else. The songs every nice are so cute, playing traditional songs from all over Asia. Recommend!",,
,,"""Must see' gardens!",5,,"We visited the Gardens by the Bay or a recent cruise call to Singapore. What a fantastic sight! Lots of small areas that are worth looking at as well as the big attractions like the two domes and the super trees. There are some beautiful plants here, augmented by statues, water features and open areas. Well worth seeing and most of it is free!",,
,,Free Sound and light show at 1900 every night,5,,"By day these gardens are an extremely pleasant area to walk or picnic in, orchids, palms statues and lakes abound. The tree top walk and glass conservatories are ticketed admission. At 7.00 pm each night at dusk, the tree top walk lights up and the sound and light show begins. A MUST visit for everyone. After the show, walk to the Marina Bay Hotel and the area immediately in front of Marina Bay arriving before 20.00 when the water sound and light show begins repeated at 21.00 hours. Both shows are amazing and we watched many times, From there walk over the Helix pedestrian bridge along the waterfront to the Esplanade. Free concert 1 Sunday a month in the afternoon and free concerts on the waterside arena and in the foyer at weekends. Entertainment doesn't have to cost a fortune in Singapore",,
,,A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!,5,,"I couldn't possibly think or write of anything negative about this experience expect from the fact that everyone who visits Singapore gets to experience this as well. It does get crowded but seriously you need to place this on your list as it is just amazing and a real credit to all of those who keep the greenery and nature alive. It does make me wonder for future generations if this is how they will think 'Nature"" was but seriously that aside you will be blown away and not just from the spray of the waterfall. Look up and around at the amazing sculptures as well.",,
,,Awesome,4,,"The musical lights display at night is awesome. The two exhibition halls with the begonias in one and the rain forest in the other are well designed and laid out but after two hours in long queues, they become a bit much.",,
,,Nice Garden,4,,Nice & soothing area with lots of people at night. Can be hot there especially when there is no wind. The OCBC Skywalk can be scary but interesting. Can see nice singapore view from there. We have to pay RM 8 to enter the skywalk.,,
,,Beautiful!,5,,"Must experience this both during the day and at night! There鈥檚 a light show in the evenings which is quite spectacular. Cloud forest is also worth seeing. It鈥檚 so well designed it feels like you鈥檙e walking in a futuristic world! Loved it!
Tip: Cloud forest is such a cool refreshing place, it鈥檚 great to walk into after sweating it outside in the gardens.",,
,,What an amazing place,5,,We visited the gardens coming into dusk and saw its beauty but then as it got dark the lights came on. This was an amazing site and one I will never forget. A light show in the gardens had everyone stop and watch. P.ease go and see for yourself.,,
,,Amazing built by human,5,,"One of the new wonders of the world built bu human.. There are a wide range of trees, flowers and plants. There are two domes like in aliens movies, and we tend to stepping into another worlds there. Remembering taking water and snacks with you because the food is quite expensive.",,
,,Awesome,5,,"Reminds me of Avatar movie, the light show was spectacular. Explore all the paid features, it is worth it.",,
,,A must see while in Singapore,5,,Our top pick from everything we saw in Singapore. Need about 3 hours at least to see it properly. The air conditioned Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome is excellent. We were lucky to see the Cherry Blossom festival Sakura Matsuri during our visit. The light and sound show at 7.45p.m is spectacular and not to be missed. There are couple of restaurants inside where one can catch dinner after the show. My suggestion is to reach Gardens by the Bay by 4p.m to truly enjoy the evening followed by Light and sound show and dinner.,,
,,Visit at night!,4,,You will feel you're at Pandora planet! Wait for the light show and observe it from the deck at the entrance.,,
,,Fabulous place,5,,Highly recommended. Don't miss the night show ( specially from the skier) which start at 7:45 and 8:45 last about 15 min be,,
,,Gardens by the Bay Singapore,5,,A visit to both sections of the Gardens is highly recommended. Access is easy via a hop on hop off bus or short walk from Marina Bay. The flora display is magnificent as is the nearby forest display. A walk to the top is a must as the views are fantastic.,,
,,Truly amazing,5,,We loved every second. We did both the domes on the Singapore Stopover Holiday package. There was a lot of people but the lines move really fasy. A must see.,,
,,Beautiful is the word,5,,"The flower dome and the cloud forest are not to be missed, especially if you have green thumbs and are close to nature.",,
,,Great for Urban Plant lovers!,5,,Millions of people live in a very small area in Singapore. This is a truly great place to see a great variety of plants and eco systems.,,
,,Perfect for Day and Night,5,,"I've been to Gardens by the Bay on two occasions, one during the day and once at night. During the day is great for the indoor activities like the Cloud Forest which is air conditioned and has some cool sights. I enjoyed the night better, due to the the light show and music which was very cool. If you can schedule your skywalk right around the light show, that is the best sight in my opinion.",,
,,Gardens by the bay,5,,Don't miss this one for some spectacular show of flowers and and a waterfall.walk down a winding path as you c bful city views.kudos to the efforts of the met.,,
,,Gardens by the Bay Light & Sound show,5,,"The light and sound show is a daily show of around 10 minutes at the Gardens by the Bay. There are 2 shows - 7.45pm & 8.45pm, both of which are free if you watch it from the open area.

If you wanna watch it from the skywalk, it has a ticket to be purchased.

Both are splendid...the skywalk is wonderful to walk but for viewing the light and sound show, my vote goes from viewing it from the open area below.

It's a short show but a must watch. Highly recommended for tourists, we the locals, prefer to wrap up our visit to the Gardens by the Bay with the 7.45 pm show too.

Very well maintained, technologically sauvvy & rythmic.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,"It is shocking how beautiful this place is. To find such lush gardens, taking the little lift to the top and walk around on suspended bridge, it is breath taking. Amazing!!!!! Do not miss it!!!!!!",,
,,Amazing experience,5,,Incredible gardens from all parts of the world set in the most amazing structures. Allow a couple of hours to take in all the areas. Make sure you are in the outside gardens at night to see the light/music show.,,
,,Must visit attraction,4,,"This is definitely a must-visit place. Great to walk around. You can rent cycles too if you are above 14. There is a play area for kids under 14. Its a water play area so go prepared with a change of clothes. All this is free. Also, don't miss the sound and light show every night.
The cloud and flower dome for which you need to pay are not so great. Cloud dome was still better, lots of places for photo opportunities. But the flower dome was small and when we went most flowers are dull.
If you are short of time, you can skip the domes, but definitely do visit the place to walk around and enjoy the rest of the stuff.",,
,,Appreciate the Beauty of Mother Earth in a City,5,,"Its a good place to go for walk early in the morning. Fresh air with all the adorable plants all around you! Exploring made easier cause of the direction and and map in most of the corners. The place have some restaurant but wont be open until lunch i guess. They have some light shows goin鈥?in the evening with the music that comes with it. The Satay by the bay offers local food, from the signature satay, chicken rice, chili and pepper crabs to those different types of cooking noodles and so on.... make sure you have an empty stomach to try all those local delicacies...",,
,,A must see tourist attraction,5,,Excellent on a rainy day!!! Need around 2 hours. I do this frequently with visitors Do around teatime before cocktails at marina bay sands-spago bar/restaurant,,
,,I love it,5,,Having visited before I wanted to show these gardens to my friend. She really enjoyed walking around. Only did the free part but you can still spend hours just wandering and admiring the trees and flowers. Next visit I will see the gardens at night.,,
,,Crowded but so pretty!,5,,"The area is very big & we can't explore all of them because we need to go somewhere else.
First we bought the ticket for SGD28 (this is to enter Cloud Forest & Flower Dome).
It was very chilled in both conservatories. You will find varieties of beautiful plants & flowers. Each of them will took around 1hr to explore (or more if you want to take lots of pictures like me).
You can also experience the OCBC Skyway on Supertree Grove for SGD8, where you can walk on thr bridge around the trees & get views of the Garden.
They also have several gardens with Malay & Colonial themes, where you can find typical plants to each theme.
You can find events at the Gardens & the Garden Hours from my photo.
If you want to go to Marina Bay Sands, you can walk through a bridge called Dragonfly Bridge.",,
,,Simply a Must while in Singapore!,5,,An absolute amazing work of engineering marvel! The beauty is limitless in this Wonderland! Plus a great escape from the humidity and heat in Singapore. Enjoy!,,
,,Awesome,5,,"It includes cloud forest ,garden by the bay n OCBC sky walk between two supertrees. First two r must visit n include in one ticket check days before visiting . They r closed on specific dates. Book from klook n ur ticket will show the closing dates .u can visit on any one day till ur ticket is valid.usally validity is for about month",,
,,Just Beautiful,5,,"If you have time, definitely come and try to check out the domes. They're just so incredibly beautiful. We came around 5 p.m., spent about 2 hours here, and then walked around outside as it was dark. Definitely recommend this timing, as we were able to see the gardens in the daylight, at dusk, and then the lights at night.",,
,,ok but nothing special,3,,"the big trees are really nice, especially at night, but the domes are completely not worth the ticket price - everything looks very fake and tacky. just go there in the evening and visit only the free part, that's the best option.",,
,,Ideal morning walk,5,,"Jet lag saw us wide awake much earlier than expected so we took a walk from our hotel around these incredible gardens. Because of the early hour, the exhibits were closed, but the gardens are so worth exploring without needing to spend any money. Next time I'd return in the evening to see all the light installations. Great place for a walk or jog.",,
,,World Class,5,,We were in awe!! Stunning set up of the Cloud Gardens and the Flower garden. Recommend it to all travellers visiting Singapore. I haven't seen anything like it in the world and the experience was awesome.,,
,,beautifully amazing,5,,unbelieveable place.loved the place.the calmness with so many flaura and fauna was really reaxing.a must go if one is visiting singapore,,

,,Beautiful,4,,We visited this last October and found it beautiful. However they closed the access to go to the top as rain was forecast. Try pick a clear day to go to avoid disappointment,,
,,Beautiful at night!,5,,"These gardens are the most amazing and wonderful you鈥檒l ever see! It is the best place to go at night as not only are the gardens beautiful but also cooling, quiet and tranquil, providing some relief from the humidity. Wonderfully designed and so very well lit, you feel you鈥檙e in the avatar movie! Didn鈥檛 cost anything to stroll around in at night. A must do in Singapore!",,
,,Night and Day are different,5,,"I highly recommend this place. Day and night are both different and each garden has a different theme. Google says this place closes at 2am but to get into the dome, it closes from memory approximately at 10am.",,
,,Controlled Natural Beauty,5,,"Experienced both the Cloud and Flower Domes (paid admission) as well as walked by the SuperTree Grove (free unless you want to walk on the Skyway. This was a completely amazing experience with the variety of flowers and plants in the Flower Dome and the lushness of the Cloud Dome. The pathway of the Cloud Dome guided the visitors upwards in representation of the different levels of a rainforest, and the indoor waterfall is astonishing.",,
,,World class indoor garden,5,,It was love at first sight the minute I walked into this place. Wide array of flowers and exotic plants from all over the globe. Truly a haven for nature and photo enthusiasts. And it has air-conditioning too. What a great way to escape and ever busy and humid city.,,
,,Flowers of the world in 1 garden.,5,,"It have a few garden of Asia: India, China, .... I am able to take a peep into these asian country through these garden. There is also a garden with local (Singapore) plants (trees, flowers, fruits,...) with some description. There is a sky bridge where I can take in the scenic veiw of Singapore from it. At night ican also enjoy the light show.
Above are all outdoor.
There are 2 huge indoor places here. The Flower Dome and The Cloud Forest.
These 2 places are fully air-con.
The Flower Dome displayed all kind of flowers from all over the world. The display will be changed periodically. Thus, I am able to see different display of different type of flowers during my mulitple visit there. I visited here quite frequently.
The cloud florest is very cooling and peaceful. Every now and then they will hold some kind of evets for the visitor to enjoy.
There are also qiute number of F&B outluets here. And also some mobile stores selling drinks & ice-cream along the way.
Only the Sky Bridge, the Flower Dome & the Cloud Forest need to pay for admission.
The rest are Free.
As I enjoy the place very much and visit it quite a few times in a year, I had join the the 'Friend of the Garden' (annual membership of Gardens by the Bay).",,
,,Other worldly,5,,This place feels like some sci fi film set. I've seen it both by day and night and I think the night is best. The trees light up and to stand under them is amazing!,,
,,"Avatar Garden in the Sky, this is not to be missed!",5,,"They should have called this the Avatar Garden, it is truly surreal. The light and sound show is mesmerising. I simply cannot express how much my husband and I loved this. We found a quiet spot a bit away from everyone else up in the gardens and watched the show. This is not to be missed, great for families. Kids would love it.",,
,,Afternoon trip,4,,Beautiful and cool retreat. Everything is well maintained and definitely recommend a visit. The Cloud Gardens were beautiful.,,
,,Family Holiday,5,,this is very nice place with lots of I formation about plants and flower. they have collect and displayed flowers and plants from all parts of world.,,
,,Marvellous garden,5,,"Of course you won't get much of natural nature in Singapore, but you've got to give it to Singapore in their effort to make the city breathes. Gardens by the Bay is certainly one of the beautiful lungs that the city has.
So come down and enjoy the gardens when you are in town. It's free! You've got to pay to go to the 2 domes & suspension bridge, but the rest is free. It's quite worth it to pay for the domes though, so I suggest that you get all 3: rain forest dome, flower dome, and OCBC bridge. Don't forget to lower your camera sometimes and just smell the flowers.

My favourite activity by far is still the stroll from GBB to MBS, best view.
O and don't forget to be there at night to enjoy the laser show",,
,,Amazing landscaping!,4,,"Free access to a lot of their beautiful gardens, except to the domes and skywalk. But for the free ones it is already satisfying. you can also access marina barrage through the gardens and have a nice ""picnic"" up there. one day is not enough if you really want to explore the whole garden. ;') enjoy the nice stroll.",,
,,"Flower Dome,",5,,"Flower dome was superb. But Cloud dome was too crowded and the queue was super long. By the time we got in, mom was too tired to walk after queuing for so long",,
,,Something that you do not see everyday,5,,The gardens are magnificent. The concept and design of the gardens are a must to see. The tropical environment means that there is always colour all year round.,,
,,Amazing!!,5,,"Truly spectacular...every few weeks the themes change. The variety of plants, trees flowers, is truly wonderful",,
,,Fabulous must see attraction when in Singapore,5,,Magnificent gardens particularly the Domes are a must visit when in Singapore. Diversity of plants and displays .,,
,,Gardens by the Bay.,5,,"Next to each other one call Forest Dom & one flower Dom. We love it! It's amazing two World's largest glass Greenhouse.
In Flower Dom which features 9 different gardens from 5 continens. And Foret Dom has 35 meter tall indoor waterfall in Cloud Forest, and as you walk your way through the mist filled Cloud Walk and Tree Top Walk. Must see! 鉂?
,,Father鈥檚 Day Nightmare,3.0,,This is my second visit to these conservatoriums. Unfortunately I didn鈥檛 realise this particular Sunday was Father鈥檚 Day. The floral dome was colourful", beautiful but crowded. The rainforest cloud dome with the waterfall was manic and unbearable. Once inside," the queues to go up started right back by the waterfall. An employee told me it鈥檚 best to visit on a week day and on dusk as they have pretty night lighting."""
,,Beautiful place!,5,,You will not want to miss this attraction! If you love nature take time to visit here! Get a pass for the Cloud Forest and explore for hours. Don't miss the flowers!,,
,,Beautiful Place,5,,Do visit this place in the evening as it鈥檚 really beautiful and close to Marina Bay. It鈥檚 within the city and a long walk is suggested,,
,,an amazing and creative garden!!!,5,,loved the modern concept and each dome has something unique to see. Best time to see is around dusk; and follow it with the outstanding laser show!!!,,
,,A five star attraction in Singapore,5,,An awesome place in every respect. Both the enclosures are equally attractive from plants and trees from all over the world and different themes. The outside ambience is also no less attractive. The super trees and the light and music show attracts hundreds of people. Worth visiting. A five star attraction!,,
,,Busy,4,,Cloud forest was worth the trip but claustrophobic walking through the gardens. Perhaps visit in the morning instead.,,
,,Amazing trip of the World of Flora in One Place,5,,"Garden by the Bay is one of the newest attraction in Singapore. There are 2 domes to visit: the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. These domes are housed in a air conditioned enclosed architectural 鈥渟phere鈥? I personally encourage all visitor to visit both because these domes are two distinct attraction. The Flower Dome is a seasonal dome that is themed for different attractions of the year. I have seen the flower dome displayed orchid competition, African trees and shrubs (baobab) etc. The cloud forest show cases a waterfall. It is really a cooling relief walking in the cloud Forest dome especially in Singapore warm and humid climate. It is really nice and an educating your for young Children, adults and even a nice walk for elderly couples. Be prepared to bring some water when you visit, to keep yourself well hydrated. There are restaurants and water point in this place. At night, the view is spectacular, especially the super tree light display makes the place surreal. The music dances with the light and bring life to the super tree. I love to bring a floor mat and lie down and enjoy the display. In my opinion the best time to visit the place is to spend the time to visit the domes, have a nice dinner and then enjoy the super tree light display.",,
,,Nice place,5,,Very nice place in Singapore. We will come back. It's amazing place. We really enjoyed with my family members. Cloud forest and flower dhome amazing.,,
,,Air Con Flower Garden,4,,"With the ability to control the temp, we are glad to be able to enjoy the cherry blossom trees from Japan itself.

It was our first time seeing the cherry blossom and we were also happy to see many interesting events during our trip to the garden.

We particularly like the live drum beating demonstration",,
,,Suitable for everyone to visit,3,,"Great for families,teenagers,couples,babies and it is a wheelchair accessible place.Therefore,it is suitable for everyone.
Great place to take pics and its one of the most famous and picturesque places in SG.
We can see many different kinds of flowers and crystals which are very pretty.
And yes,tickets are needed to enter the two domes...Cloud forest and flower dome.",,
,,Wonderful garden,5,,Built at a cost of 1 billion sing dollar. Took 5 yrs to build. 30000 species of plant and flowers from all oover the world and 700000 of them. Woth the visit indeed,,
,,Technological marvel,5,,"Things I most liked in flower dome was olive trees. I didn't install the mobile applications therefore i couldn't enjoy educational narration about the plants. Things I loved most about cloud forest are orchids. They have very fine and rare orchid collections. Some Orchid need magnifying glasses to view. The idea of having LEGO version of pitcher plant at the top of cloud forest mountain was very unjustified and worse. We had more like leisure sight seeing walk and it took us two hours for both domes. For those want spend time learning about rain forest and plant taxonomy might need very long hours because they are tonnes of details and informations for those who are interested.

I visited both flower dome and cloud forest on a Saturday evening. The atmosphere was overcrowded and long ques at lift area. I was told by my agent to visit in the morning to avoid many people but the reason I visited in the evening was to experience sunset from the garden and enjoy light show but unfortunately too many people. Sunset view was very nice but don't expect to see sun set in the horizon because sun will go behind the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. OCBC sky deck also interesting activity to try. It's a replica for real canopy walk in rain forest. Light show is something not to missed as it the grand highlight for the day. The moment light show over everyone rush back MRT station. Walk way to station was confusing because it's like we walking in maze with limited signs but park rangers whom patrolling the park helps to guide us back to Bayfront MRT Station. It was dark after the light show so walk in group to avoid get lost in the park.

We dined at nearby food court /restaurant while waiting for light show. Food was tasty and authentically Asian but a little bit pricey.

I was really amazed by the glass house design. It is really a possible solution for future food production or living in planet mars in the future.",,
,,Garden by the way,5,,Its very nice with diffrent flowers plant and has beautiful view in evening. Must visit place if you are visiting Singapore,,
,,Awesome place,5,,One of the best place to visit. This is also photographers paradise. One can spend countless hours at this place.,,
,,GARDENS BY THE BAY - a must see!,5,,We went to Gardens by the Bay at night. It is a truly magical experience. Absolutely loved it. The light show is at 7.45pm so it is especially good to be on the sky walk at that time. Although it is almost as spectacular from ground level. It is only $8 per head for sky walk. We are going back tomorrow to Gardens by the Bay in the daytime to really explore and appreciate all of the garden.,,
,,Stunning!,5,,"Simply superb! Well worth a visit, would thoroughly recommend for visitors of all ages!! Don鈥檛 forget your camera!",,
,,A must see for visitors to Singapore,5,,"Two fantastic gardens at the Gardens by the Bay(GBTB)! Join as friends of the GBTB near the ticketing office and you get discount into these wonderful gardens. Both gardens are fully air-conditioned so you are shielded from the tropical heat. The gardens are green powered with bio fuel. Proceed first to the Flower Dome to see flora from the world over, eg, Australia, South Africa, South America, California, etc. Stop by the cactus garden too. The Central area showcases the theme of the season, in June it is the Begonia theme in bright beautiful blooming colours. The Flower Dome is linked to the next one called the Cloud Forest where you will be greeted by the tallest man-made water fall. Enjoy your ascend to the 7th heaven and descend gradually through levels of different flora and orchids to the tropical rainforest level.
One more stop to enjoy would be the OCBC Skyway where you will be elevated to an altitude to enjoy scenic view of Marina Bay Sands and the garden city. If you鈥檙e there in the evening, you get to enjoy the synchronised music and lighting performance, free of charge. Just sit or lie down on the ground and let the sights and sound soothe your fatigue away!",,
,,Birthday,5,,"This was the main reason for visiting Singapore. Takes your breath away, amazing construction. I don鈥檛 think I have the words to describe how beautiful this is. A must visit!!",,
,,Outstanding,5,,"All i can say about this place is, you MUST visit but I would recommend it at night to ensure you see the trees and the music show around the big one. It was my favorite place in Singapore.",,
,,Grand man made forrest,4,,"the best route to visit the Garden by the bay is from the esplanade, then you can walk on the side of MBS, and after visiting Garden by the bay, you can go to MBS via a middle route that lead directly to the hotel. it has connecting door to the mall.",,
,,Great Day Out,4,,"There is a lot to do at Gardens by the Bay, the two domes are both great in their own way and there is also plenty to see through the gardens, it comes to light at night for a spectacular show",,
,,Cherry Blossom exhibition,4,,"Though the trees were few, there were many other beautiful plants and flowers to attract the visitors. The place was quiet but the temperature and ambience were still comfortable to roam around.",,
,,Impressive Lightshow,4,,"Gardens by the Bay was a great experience. The thought and effort gone into this area is phenomenal.
The outdoor gardens are free to walk around all day and see the wonderful flowers and sculptures they have on offer.
There is 2 air conned conservatories that cost (15SGD) roughly.
The light show at the super tree grove is fantastic. Also FREE.
They have 2 shows daily ( 7:45pm & 8:45pm ) check times. They may vary ???

,,WOnderful place,5,,"I had a great night in this ""garden"", so beautiful, you must see the lighting show once in a life time.",,
,,Light show at night,5,,This is amazing and is on every night for free! Best show of light and sound. Very popular so get there in plenty of time and grap a position. Lie back and watch the show overhead! Fantastic!,,
,,Amazing view!!!,5,,"Well this is my 2nd time visit here and i still enjoyed the view and still amazed to this place. Best time to come for me is in the evening, yeah it is more beautiful in the day light but the view of the light in the night outside is more fulfilling..",,

,,Spend at least 4-5 hours here to truly enjoy this place,5,,We made the mistake of going to Gardens by the Bay on a stop-by 2 hour visit. Realised that it is far too less time and then went back next day for half a day which was ideal. The sound and light show at the Supertrees is a nice way to end your day before going to Satay by the Bay for a decent meal,,
,,Amazing!,5,,Large gardens set above the city and a big tourist attraction so be prepared for crowds. The lift to take you up is not large(maybe holds about 20 people) and there are always queues but not long waiting periods. An amazing tropical garden area with lakes and fountains and an experimental eco system.,,
,,Garden City,5,,"A gem in the city. Clean and green, certainly a breather away from the concrete jungle of high buildings.",,
,,Air-con not so cool,4,,"Did not experience that kind of cool weather which I was expecting to be like in Genting Highland, especially during noon time.Therefore most floral did not seems to sustain freshness for long. However, overall experience was good.",,
,,Where else could they build such a brilliant setup but Singapore. Well done.,5,,Having been to Singapore on many occasions we had never been to the Gardens by the Bay. This was well worth the trip. The sheer scope of what there is to see and how it has been put together is absolutely fantastic. Anyone travelling to Singapore and has the time to visit this location should do so. It is only a short taxi ride from hotels in the city and well worth the time.,,
,,Beautiful Place,5,,Gardens by the bay is beyond awesome its like your in another world.Supertrees grove is like the trees of the future. Its so beautiful specially at night.The light show starts at 7:45 pm. You can go here by mrt alight at bayfront station and just follow the signs.,,

The flower dome and cloud forest are wonderful experiences and could be visited by purchasing tickets. The other areas of the garden are free to visit. Take a stroll in the OCBC skywalk(by paying) to get breath taking views and to get closer to the mesmerising Supertree groves.
Do not miss the garden Rhapsody ( 7.45PM ,8.45PM) . The whole garden comes to life with flamboyant colors and music.",,
,,GARDEN BY THE BAY SINGAPORE,5,,Amazing must see place of Singapore.Evening show at 8.00 pm must see and no cost for that.You can see cloud forest first and garden dome second dome which needed cost.Very great place of Singapore.,,
,,Gardend by the Bay Singapore,5,,"Beutiful place to visit. A must see if you go to Singapore.
Went last april to see the sakura festival. Simply wonderful. I can be pretty crowded. Maybee, it's would be better to visit it on weekdays instead of weekends. Overall the place is something worth to see as a solo traveler and for the whole family.",,
,,"Flowers, plants and air conditioning",5,,"GBTB was a whole day experience for us. We arrived around 9:30 am and got back to our hotel (Fairmont) around 9 pm.

To orientate yourself to the site take the open air trolley bus to see all of the different ethnic group climatic plantings.

We spent a significant amount of time in the Flower Dome - absolutely huge. The main focus that week was on tulips over varying colours and sizes accompanied by animated people type displays.

We also spent time in the Cloud Forest Dome. Imagine a 8 story Domed cone shaped structure with a sloping external ramp with vertical gardens of rainforest plants with lifts and staircases running through the centre of it that periodically get misted. FANTASTIC.

We didn't go up to the Skywalk due to my partner being distressed by open spaced heights but from the ground image 40 -60 metre cones with gardens growing all around the sides from top to bottom. In one of the big ones there is even a restaurant at the top.

Around 4 pm we left to take in the nearby huge hotel complex, with a boat shaped structure serving as its penthouse, to get some food.

At around 7 pm, just when it is starting to get a little less sunny, we headed back to the Gardens for the evening lights show. Suggest you take a blanket as you lie on the ground under neath the Skywalk and look up at the Skywalk cones which have millions of lights on them which a syncopated to music.",,
,,Never seen anything like this amazing place,5,,"go here when it is tulip mania, but I always go Cloud forest because the sound of waterfalls is so relaxing.",,
,,Oasis of calm,5,,"I often go to Gardens by the Bay. Even though I live in Singapore and have been there quite a few times, it never fails to impress me..Having such a grand garden around the central area makes the whole region even more mesmerizing, somehow the backdrop of MBS building and CBD blends in really well.
You can choose to go and visit the domes in the daytime ans go for a stroll and check the light/music show twice every night. You can easily spend 1 whole day and night there..even more if you are into plants, botany, gardens etc..for me, it's such a great chill out spot with moat areas being free of charge.",,
,,Worthy Trip,5,,"I do recommendation this place and visit on December as they do have decoration event for celebrate Christmas, things to play and food to eat.
Visit the Dome will never make you disappointment as there are numbers of international flower you will never see it before, they are really well maintain of the flower. It is great to bring kids as for them to see and knowledge different flower need different temperature. Example for Lily Flower need cold temperature to maintain of the freshness.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay,3,,"For visitors, it's great place to go at least once when they are in Singapore. However, for locals, it's expensive for a family to go outing for a day when there is special event being hosted. Recommended to go once but not frequent.",,
,,Amazing!,5,,"Gardens by the bay is both beautiful day and night ! Night, is spectacular, with the giant trees lighting up, changing colours. Well worth a visit.",,
,,Wonder within the city,4,,It something beautiful that has been made in the heart of the city. Can be reached easily and the flaura inside these structures are amazing. Good place to go with family as well as solo,,
,,Oasis but in downtown,5,,"Very close to bayfront mrt and Marina Bay sands. From Marina Bay sands it is just across road. Most of the park is free. But few attraction like cloud forest are ticket entry. At the entrance from Bay front side .There is a river, Very scenic. It has bridge for Good photo ops. Once you cross the bridge. There are country specific gardens like Malay garden India garden. I could truly appreciate India garden. There was a Banian tree in middle and Budha statue too.
Next I visited cloud forest. It reminded me of zurrasic park. A very high mountain with water fall.you can go inside mountain. At top of Mountain good view of city.
Light shows on iron trees are excellent.from distance tree reminde me of movie avatar.
One should visit garden in day time and evening time separately.",,
,,Amazing!,4,,"A incredible visual extravaganza at every turn, Plants from around the world with different themes and stunning foliage everywhere you look. Waterfalls, raised walkways, blooming colors simply stunning! They do charge to enter the flower dome and cloud forest (around $28 sing ) but its well worth the admission fee. It Does get very busy so allow plenty of time to see as much as you can.",,
,,Relax and be mesmerized by the garden lights,5,,A nice place to spend time if you live locally or you are a tourist. Be dazzled by the lights and be there for the light shows which runs for 15 mins or so.,,
,,Great place,5,,A must visit for anyone who loves plants n flowers. The tulip garden which usually opens in May-June is something not to be missed.,,
,,Mind Blowing,5,,"I am not usually into gardens, but this place has to be seen to be believed. We only had 2.5 hours, we needed at least 4-5 hours to do it justice.",,
,,Unique and beautiful gardens,5,,Beautiful and unique gardens under glass. But I was expecting high humidity for the plants and it was cool and dry in each of the domes. There are also gardens outside if you want to meander in the heat. Definitely worth seeing.,,
,,COOL AIR,5,,"love this place to the max. Everything was in tip top condition. Very easy to navigate around with multiple lifts and elevators. It was a refreshing time there,",,
,,"Safe, clean, spacious, well-curated",4,,"My child loves this garden, especially the Flower Dome, Cloud Forest, OCBC Skyway, audio tours, automated shuttle and normal shuttle rides.

We visit nearly every week since we signed up the membership (Friends of the Garden). The first year, we were fortunate to receive a discount. Unfortunately, the second year, there was no discount. It was quite a hefty sum for my elderly mom, my kid and myself, especially since I am also paying for very expensive monthly experimental cancer treatments that are ironically not subsidised at public hospitals even though I am a subsidised patient because the cancer drug is very new.",,
,,Relaxing and mesmerizing,5,,"Amazing place for friends, couple or family trip. Lush greenery with amazing indoor cloud forest with air-conditioned dome as well. Take note some areas needs to get tickets, example like the flower dome, cloud forest, ocbc skyway.",,
,,Conservatories are worth it!,5,,"Walking through the gardens is free, but on a typical sunny day in Singapore, it鈥檚 nice to cool off in the air-conditioned conservatories. A ticket into both the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest are worth it. Both are so well-thought our and well-maintained. The Flower Dome exhibit changes seasonally emphasizing a particular flower. We got to see the begonias. The Cloud Forest is spectacular with the iconic indoor waterfall and includes a nice walk above the clouds, closing with educational media exhibits about conserving the environment.

The two-conservatory ticket does not include entrance to Skywalk.

As of June 2018, tickets for both conservatories are SGD 20 for Singaporeans/PR/work pass holders and SGD 28 for others. Next time I go, I鈥檓 planning to go into Chinatown beforehand to see if I can obtain cheaper tickets before heading to the gardens.",,
,,"great day, amazing gardens",4,,"this place is amazing, Singapore really knows how to do something well, the only downfall is the long lines at domes. Worthwhile visit, buy tickets prior through viator. the lightshow is magnificent.",,
,,Nice botany,4,,Good botany great structures night scene is nice with reflection on water but need seek shelter and aircon from humidity,,
,,"Educational, Enthralling, and Enriching Experience",5,,"While the outdoor part is beautiful with lots of nice vegetation to see, it can be a bit warm and humid during the day, and so it's better to plan to go there during the late afternoon or early evening...But what takes the cake are the two domes...you will see plants and flowers from all over the world, in really cool atmosphere, which can sometimes get a bit cold...but nevertheless, a welcome respite from the heat and humidity. Most of the plants and flowers on display have signs displaying the names and other information, so it's educational too. If you go during seasonal times like Christmas, Chinese New Year or Halloween periods, the flower dome will be dressed to the hilt with the corresponding theme, providing perfect photo opportunities. There are also many restaurants if you get hungry, and well stocked gift shops to pick up a souvenir or two.

On the whole, you will have a good time there, but do avoid going there on public holidays as it gets incredibly crowded...and there will be really long queues and waiting time to get into the domes. What I did was to take leave on a work day to bring my overseas guests there early on a weekday morning - there were not many people and we had a really great time.",,
,,Excellent,4,,"Well worth a visit - time it so that you鈥檙e there towards the end of the day. Go through the gardens, have some food, stay for the trees at night.",,
,,Heavenly Gardens,5,,This is one of the beautiful and popular places in Singapore. Sky way bridge is a wonderful experience. The cloud forest is outstanding and amazing. Evening lightens up the ambience with glittering lights. There isca play area for children as well. All in all its a must visit place in Singapore.,,
,,It's not worth the amount paid for the tickets,1,,The dome may seems impressive in the outside and inside but the amount to pay for the entrance fee does not justify it. Been here once and will not return again.,,
,,Excellent place,5,,One of the best indoor and outdoor garden in the world. Highly recommend visiting once in your life.,,
,,A great attraction with plenty of options that are free,5,,"While there will be plenty of focus on the paid attractions like the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome (and deservedly so), there is actually plenty to explore and enjoy without paying a cent.

Take a stroll through the landscaped gardens and paths through the greens or walk by the side of the stream. Much to see and enjoy. If you're on a budget, you can drop by the Macs for a meal.",,
,,Revisit to the garden,4,,Good choice of flowers on display. Nice layout with comparable crowd control. Always enjoyed our visit there over the years.,,
,,A Site to See,3,,"If you are fond of various plants and flowers, this is a great place to see seasonal flowers. We went there the second time and saw various tulips displays. I believe we visited on a holiday and the place is packed with people so it鈥檚 hard to enjoy the scenery. If you want to visit the place, go on a weekday and early in the morning. We were no able to see the entire facility due to long lines and late in the afternoon. The entrance fee is quite pricey if you don鈥檛 get to enjoy the place due to crowding.",,
,,Don鈥檛 miss Gardens by the Bay,5,,Absolutely wonderful. There are two massive greenhouses/glasshouses. One with gardens of the world the other with a very tall waterfall. All beautifully maintained. One of the highlights of our trip.,,
,,"Beautiful, Inspirational, and Fun!",5,,Great place to visit with children. They regularly change & update the themes. Huge range of activities from playgrounds and water play for the physically active and domes and walkabouts for those just looking to relax,,
,,Enchanting ...always,5,,"Ive visited Gardens by The Bay 6 times over the past 2 years, each time I take a visitor there I am enchanted with the place- its such a beautiful environment- the temperature inside the cloud dome is a welcome releif from the heat, and can happlily wander for hours in the domes. A must see whether visiting or local.",,
,,Must visit,5,,"These gardens just blew our minds. Flower dome and cloud forest is simply unbelievable, right in middle of the city this place is a slice of paradise. The wide variety of trees and flowers refreshes your mind and brings a smile on your face. The waterfall and mist in cloud forest gives a relief from humidity. Supergroove gives one a very for view of the garden and surroundings. It's a must visit place in Singapore.",,
,,Fantastic day and night,5,,Fantastic mix of man made creativity and nature. Singapore must see by day and night. Be sure to try satay at satay by the bay while there.,,
,,Beautiful nature reserve.,5,,A must visit tourist spot in Singapore. Its filled with nature and have a cold temperature inside the dome. Really a nice place to stop by.,,
,,Visit to Flower Forest and Cloud Forest,4,,1St time visit to these 2 places after it opened many years ago. Surprisingly beautiful. Need to upkeep the flower conditions. Value for money and it is right to have discount for the locals.,,
,,Nice garden!,5,,"Our family made a 鈥渜uick鈥?visit to the Gardens by the Bay. Why quick? The garden area was pretty large and as you know it, we have to walk in between the attractions. And this is the reason why we made it quick. We weren鈥檛 prepared for Singapore being hot and humid. LOL. So we had to cut short to this garden.

Gardens of the Bay is actually a beautiful place to visit. They have different garden theme. They also have sections for kids, including a splash area. A perfect location to cool off for the kids. So if you are planning to visit Gardens of the Bay with kids in tow, do bring towels and extra clothes because kids being kids, they will want to get soaked here.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,"These gardens are absolutely wonderful, you do not need to be a garden lover the appreciate these gardens. Spending a day here was no trouble at all. We were on a day stop over on a cruise ship, so deceive to visit the gardens which was walking distance from the cruise terminal.",,
,,Fascinating,5,,"The name 'Gardens by the Bay' is so understated that when you're finally there it's like nothing you'd expect. The closest thing I can think of are those futuristic cities in the Star Trek movies. The gardens are great, the architecture is spectacular and the views of the city are like nothing else. The domes are well worth the additional ticket to visit, though the sculptures inside are a little cheesy - there's nothing they needed to add to the spectacular plant life. For all that, there are quiet places to just sit and enjoy. One tip - make your way to 'Satay by the Bay' - the walk is great and so is the food!",,
,,The best domes ever,5,,"Singapore is so hot and humid, but a visit to the amazing domes here is not only a spectacular sight but gives you a breather as it is kept to around 20C. In one dome, there is a huge waterfall and a wee hill which is overprinted with temperate flowering plants from fuchsias, begonias to orchids. The plants are reviewed and changed monthly as needed. The other dome has an exhibition side which changes regularly as well as strange plantings from Baobab trees , through Proteas to Cacti. These two domes are truly exciting especially if you are interested in plants.",,
,,Plants have never been more amazing,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is world class and inspirational. Easily the highlight of our recent trip to Singapore.

You probably already know that there are two gigantic glasshouses:

The 鈥楩lower Dome鈥?is the largest glass greenhouse on the planet and features plants of the world including one thousand year old olive trees from the Mediterranean.

The other glasshouse is known as the 鈥楥loud Forest鈥?features the world鈥檚 tallest and probably most beautiful indoor waterfall.

What you may not know is the best time to go. Time your stay backwards from the first free light show at 7.45pm and you鈥檒l have a grand experience.

Allow an hour each for the 鈥楩lower Dome鈥?and the 鈥楥loud Forest鈥? Then at least another hour wondering around the awesome 鈥楽upertree Grove鈥?with tree-like sculptures that range in height from 25-50 metres.

On the top of the tallest Supertree is Indochine restaurant and bar. This is great place to plant (sorry about the garden pun) yourself, enjoy a drink and something to eat and then watch Singapore transform from day to night.

Take the elevator down to ground level at approximately 7.30pm and you鈥檒l be in one of the best spots to watch the light show. A great way to top off your stay in what is now Singapore鈥檚 No.1 tourist attraction.",,
,,Worth the walk through,5,,"Really worth seeing the diversity of the flowers is great and the tree gardens are really something else. Worth two trips, one in the day and then to see it at night.",,
,,Never seen anything like this amazing place,5,,"Loved the Cloud forest conservatory. Unique setup, especially the waterfall. Flower dome was okay. Super tree grove and OCBC Skywalk were very good. There is shuttle from MRT which takes you directly to the entrance.
There was a lot of waiting time for getting taxis for going back because huge queue.",,
,,Mesmerizing,5,,What a wonder to see all vegetation from all over the world in one place. Fabulous blooms in myriad breathtaking hues. A must see. It will be a day well spent at the gardens by the bay,,
,,Nice place to visit but very crowded,4,,So nice to walk around in the gardens. But very crowded in the middle of the day until late afternoon. Maybe better a little bit earlier in the morning.,,
,,Most Magical Place I have been since childhood,5,,Don't miss this extraordinary Botanical Gardens! Each section has groups of plants and orchids you can't imagine existed! The surprise carved sculptures popping up unexpectedly and truly works of art!,,
,,An education trip for many tourist,4,,"For many people who want to learn or like to view different plants or flower from almost every parts of the world, Gardens By The Bay is an attraction for you to enjoy.
Within one Dome, you may experience rain-forest environment and man-made waterfall while another Dome may have different theme depends on the festival season.",,
,,Miniature Netherlands,3,,"Bringing tulips to Garden by the Bay brightened up the exhibit. However, the other non-Dutch plants don't blend well with the Tulip. The transformation should be complete rather than partial",,
,,Worth a trip,5,,"Went there with friends and it鈥檚 definitely something different. The place is beautiful at night, though bring water as the weather is quite hot.",,
,,nice n quiet place,4,,"nice and quiet place. the spectacular n beautiful nite scenery, regardless of the nite sky or the flashing neon lightings from the s'pore flyer or the color lightings from the surrounding bldgs...it just nice and quiet to walk alone or with company.",,
,,nice and quiet place,4,,"this place was indeed a nice and quiet place. the spectacular n beautiful nite scenery, regardless of the nite sky or the flashing neon lightings from the s'pore flyer or the color lightings from the surrounding bldgs...it just nice and quiet to walk alone or with company.",,
,,poor condition,2,,all the flowers were in poor condition temperature was high too over crowded nothing special waste of time and money,,
,,Great light show,5,,"The OCBC skywalk was lovely as we got a paranomic view of the entire place. We tried to coincide the light show with the skywalk but was unsuccessful as the queue was too efficient. There were Marshalls everywhere taking stock of our precious fifteen minutes worth of time. Therefore, if the queue time states 45mins,it may be a mere 10 to 15min worth of wait only (before you get up the lift and go to the skywalk).

Light show was great even though it was the free event. You have to lie down on one of those concrete benches to get a good view of the light show.

Toilets around the level one areas were clean too, despite the crowds. Great job,thanks :)",,
,,You wont find any other place like this anywhere,5,,Beautiful domes and lots of scenery right under the famous Marina Bay Sands. Very clean. Wonderful to visit in the evening when the weather is not so hot and lots of breeze. From a near distance is the lights of central CBD. Romanticplace for couples and family.,,
,,Great place but just too crowded,4,,"As beautiful as promised problem is that everyone wants to visit it. It would then be wise to go on a weekday. The place is HUGE so make sure if you're timing things like the lights show you give yourself amole time to walk across the garden and get a good spot to watch it from.

The flower place was also abit overrated unless you're a really huge fan of flowers (kinda obvious but it didnt sink until I was inside)

Didnt get to go into the cloud dome",,
,,Wonderful place to visit,5,,"It is a wonderful place to visit, all credit to those who have created a masterpiece where you can spend good time with nature.. thanks",,
,,Fantastic,5,,"Totally amazing place, went in the day and then returned at night to see it with all the lights. Not knowing what to expect of Singapore we are so glad to experience Gardens by the Bay",,
,,Beautiful,5,,Enjoyed it very much. Was very relaxing and loved all the different displays. I liked going up each level and seeing the different views. I would recommend it as something you shouldn't miss doing .,,
,,Amazing!,5,,"Amazing day, however check timings for opening. They also have a light show early evening, which you should go early for, but worth a watch. Garden itself is lovely and would recommend.",,
,,Unmissable Experience,5,,"Incredible experience wandering through the flower dome and rainforest dome as well as walking along the tree top board walk. Beautifully laid out gardens with spectacular colours and carefully placed thematic garden spaces. Many pleasurable hours were spent wandering through the gardens - nothing else I have experienced before compares to this display of plants and flowers. The light show at night transforms the trees interspersed through the gardens outside the domes into a dramatic colourful display, not to be missed. Visited the gardens a few times during our recent stay in Singapore.",,
,,Amazing,5,,The rain did not stop us from enjoying this amazing place highly recommended for everyone as there is so much to see and do,,
,,Family Outing,5,,It was a great visit to Gardens by the Bay. Well spent night at flower dome and cloud forest. Beautiful scenaries and displays at these places.,,
,,LITTLE DISAPPOINTMENT,3,,"Went to Gardens by the bay 2-3 times a year but the most recent visit, i was a bit disappointed. Almost all the flowers / cactus are the same as past few months. Only small area has new flowers such as lily etc but can see that some flowers were drying up. Hopefully can have more changes in flowers.

No 'WOW' feeling after visiting more than 1 time a year. If majority of flowers keep on repeating, i'm afraid sooner or later, tourists will be tired of seeing same flowers repeatedly. This is the 2nd time i brought my overseas friends to Gardens by the bay. They also find not much changes in the flowers except small portion with new seasonal flowers. Moreover, the cactus area remains the same since last year. My overseas friends been there twice and will not go 3rd time because really no major changes.",,
,,Excellent experience but too costly,5,,Worth a visit. Ticket per head SGD28 is a bit costly. Dont have sufficient facilities e.g. bench and toilets inside the domes.,,
,,Great and beautiful!!,5,,Gardens by the Bay now have beautiful display of flowers. Go see!! And I really enjoy taking many pictures,,
,,A remarkable garden,5,,The plants were planted in such a wonderful manner that it became an awe inspiring and magnificent view for visitors,,
,,A must to visit!,5,,Blown away by the beauty of this place! Love the indoor gardens with air condition. And a definite must to visit the Super tree grove for the amazing music and light show. Very mesmerizing!,,
,,Begonias beauty in World Class must do in Singapore,5,,"I was cynical, my partner said we will be going, I trudged along reluctantly. Flower pavilion, superb Devine delectable, brilliant, In the Cloud, wonderful, wise, wistfully,wishing to return. You must do this !",,
,,Flower Dome and SuperTree Light Show @ Gardens By the Bay,5,,"The visit there was very pleasant and it was overall, a very relaxing trip for a family with kids and older adults in the mix. It will be great if there could be more lifts for prams and handicapped (I went on a weekend with a public holiday, so it was very crowded. I'm guessing that during non-peak hours, it would be less crowded and more manageable). Would also be great if you could have more drinking points (water cooler units).

For those who want to work quietly while still surrounded by nature, this is a perfect place to hang out during non-peak hours and upon purchase of the annual membership card (free entry within card validity). There is an MRT station located nearby so transportation is quite convenient.",,
,,Supertree grove daily show,5,,"be there at 7.30 pm to spot a nice place, laying down and enjoy the garden rhapsody light and sound show.",,
,,A DON'T MISS even on a short trip; go near dust & see 7:45 pm light show!,5,,"Go just before dusk (5 pm or so) and spend about an hour in each of the 2 main ""domes""; then head out to the big ""TREES"" at 7:35 or so for the wonderful LIGHT SHOW. Be sure to head for the TREES just before 7:40 as then the crowds are like a huge wave of people all heading in that direction. It doesn't matter much where you sit--all on the ground or on steps. Just be sure when leaning back or lying back that you have a good view of the tree tops. Psychedelic show! Have your camera ready or just enjoy the colors and forms. All that said, each of the DOMES is fascinating. Be sure to do the circular walks. In the rain forest/cloud forest one, be sure to take the elevator to the TOP and walk down--slowly. This whole place is quite an achievement.",,
,,Loved!!,5,,"A different kind of experience.
Made me think about what would the world be like if we put this much effort conserving gardens outside! Did enjoy this experience but also made me realise a lot of people were visiting a plastic park ... parts of it anyway! We were there for the spraying at 7pm into the vertical garden which was cool. Would recommend. We hired bikes and cycled around outside too.
Great area, especially during the evening. Time your visit so you get the best of both worlds.",,
,,A place not to be missed - GBTB,5,,"Gardens by the Bay (GBTB) offers a variety of activities for solo, couples, family and friends. For those who dislike humid weather, the flower dome and cloud forest provide air-conditioned environment for visitors to enjoy the beautiful sight coupled with educational facts. The Garden Rhapsody at Supertrees Grove at 7.45pm and 8.45pm provides spectacular display of light and sound at night. It is free too!!

For families with children, the Children's Garden is a place to go for a fun-filled activities. Another free attraction. Who says Singapore is an expensive place?

For solo/couples, you can stroll the vast compound and have a picnic overlooking the financial district and the iconic Marina Bay Sands.

For the lucky ones, you might be able to catch a sighting of the Marina Bay otters. Please respect the wild by keeping a distance.

Proceed to Satay By the Bay to tuck in some local food.

You can spend a whole day at this GBTB

Casual clothing and good pair of walking shoes are recommended.",,
,,Must visit when in Singapore!,5,,"Whenever my family visits me here in Singapore, we always make sure that we will be able to visit Gardens by the bay. It offers different kinds of theme every season so you will never get bored visiting this place anytime.",,
,,Fabulous,5,,"Option is family but it isn't there

Gardens by the Bay is incredible to see.

However on the website it said the domes are closed for refurbishment. But once we were there we found they were open!!!!

Very disappointed as we would have gone much much earlier. But we didn't have any time to do both domes.

We thought this was a DISGRACE as it was a place we wanted to visit!

Overall the gardens are amazing and so was the forest done that we did get to see. The light show was fantastic and a sight you want to see !

And what we saw of the gardens it was incredible!",,
,,Breathtakingly beautiful,5,,"Went to the gardens not expecting much and was amazed by what I saw!
We walked all around the gardens before heading over to the Steel Trees, Cloud Forest (beautiful waterfall 7 floors tall, with beautiful flowers and educational fun inside) and Flower Dome (flowers from around the world and the Japanese Cherry blossom). There is so much to see I spent 3 hours just looking around. There is also plenty of places for food and drink.
One thing I would say is come back in the evening!!
The light show is just phenomenal! Times are 7:45 and 8:45pm. The lights and the music were brilliant and bought back lots of childhood memories.
I wish I had been more than once during my stay in Singapore.
DO NOT MISS THIS!!",,
,,Exciting,5,,Very nice place and must visit when you are going to Singapore. You can go at noon or evening to see the garden with spectacular light.,,
,,You must go,5,,This place is a must go place when you visit Singapore especially when you are taking Kids under 12.,,
,,Get in early,4,,"We visted twice in the same day. We went in the morning which was great, nice and cool and less people. We also visited the same night to see the light show which was pretty warm but also very good and both were free. Be warned though as people like to lay on the ground for the nightly light show and after standing and looking up at the lights in the same place for 5 minutes I trod on someone who decided to lay at my feet with their family. Could have ended badly with my 95kg squishing them in freefall. We then quickly went to check out the laser show within the marina to get the 9pm show as the 8pm one had been cancelled. Best to keep some change in your disappointment bank as not everything goes the plan.",,
,,"2nd visit, even better than the first.",5,,"This time we were a month later and whilst the beds were being prepared for the spring display last April, this year all the tulips were out and the display was amazing, with houses, shops and windmills giving a Dutch feel.
Our intention was to stay until dark to see the 'trees' illuminated and were close the lake when the fireworks display started. We were blown away with the amazing light changes through the trees. Well worth a return visit.",,
,,Great place,5,,Must visit around evening. The view get better when it's dark. Nothing much to see if go too early. Bring some mosquito repellent as well because mosquitoes tends to come out after dark.,,
,,One of the wonders of the world!,5,,Unbelievable- cloud forest was something that I will remember for a very long time . Hard to believe that this is all man made. You don鈥檛 have to love plants to be impressed .,,
,,nice,4,,it is definatelly must see in singapore but i think the observation is not necesary to pay for not that amazing,,
,,Fantastic,5,,"Grab the Two Dome ticket special, the Flower and Cloud Domes. They are right next to one another and will blow your mind. Right now, there is a Begonia Display and if you love flowers, you will certainly love this. The Cloud Dome with its waterfall is unique and two hours flew by.",,
,,Quick trip to check it out.,5,,We had no idea what it was all about when we got in the cab from our hotel to go and see this attraction. It is easy to get to from anywhere in Singapore and is quite a sight the first time you see it with the giant trees and the domes. They don鈥檛 offer any discounts except if you want to see all of their attractions during the same day. It was quite hot during our stay but going into the mountain Gardens was very cool. Because my daughter was in a wheelchair we were able to get around quite easily actually. We spent about an hour or so at this attraction but could easily have spent more if you are really into flowers especially orchids. The staff is especially cordial and is willing to help you get to where you need to go. This is a must see if you have time!,,
,,Must-see,5,,"This was our best stop in Singapore. The place is breathtaking, with the two domes the highlight. We could have spent hours here and would make sure it is part of your itinerary!",,
,,Nice family visit,5,,"Great time at gardens by the bay, flower dome and cloud forest worth going. All air conditioning. Roughly 2 hours for the visit.",,
,,"Gardens By the Bay, Singapore",4,,"(1) Ticketing is efficient
(2) Service is excellent
(3) Gardens are well planned and the theme resonates with the local season as well as international flower season like Sakura during Spring, Tulips etc..
We particularly like the night symphony with the lights and the music , however this round, there were some renovation which were incomplete , resulting in lack of sitting places especially for the elderly and tired children and families. Just a suggestion for improvement, it will be good to have the gardens dotted with some benches here and there for the tired garden visitors to sit, especially at the main supertrees area.Also, the",,
,,Amazing Supertrees,5,,The light and sound show by the Supertrees made me gasp in surprise - it was simply amazing! Am shooked,,
,,"Impressive, beautiful manufactured garden.",5,,"If you love manicured gardens, this is for you. Painstaking planted and beautiful, you don't need to pay to enjoy the gardens. Lightshow happens every night. The paid areas are beautiful and worth a visit too.",,
,,A must do on the Singapore tour list,5,,"This is a definite must do activity in Singapore.
The gardens themselves are immaculate and well designed. But there are many individual highlights to keep you mesmerised.
The Cloud Forest conservatory is just a magnificent blend of nature and engineering brilliance. The evening Garden Rhapsody light show is stunningly beautiful.
Enjoy the shuttle through the gardens, or take the driverless option for a whole new experience.",,
,,Beautiful garden. Unique light show,5,,"The garden is so colourful with the hundreds of different blooming trees and flowers. It is beautiful in daytime and nighttime as well. Hidden spot lights everywhere make this garden extremely romantic after sunset.
At 7:45pm and 8:45pm there is a unique light show in the middle of the garden. The best spot to enjoy it is right at the 鈥渞oots鈥?of the super trees. Don鈥檛 be shy to sit or lay on the ground!",,
,,Extraordinary !,5,,"Amazed by the design and concept, its vast variety of plant, trees & flowers are just mesmerizing. Cozy aircon makes the feeling just right, with a touch of colors from the gardens. One of the best place on earth! Four thumbs un to the Singaporean gov",,
,,Beaitiful,5,,Beautiful place. Really well done displays. Cloud dome is nice and cool. Does get crowded later on in day.,,
,,Must go,5,,This is a must go attraction in SG. The garden maintained outside is good but the flower dome and cloud forest is must watch. Worth paying for it.,,
,,Magic Lights,5,,We did a night excursion and saw the lightshow. It is as if you are in a magic world with the music and lights. It only lasted 15 minutes but it was worth seeing. We also did a river cruise and it was great. We went to the 56th floor of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel which is shaped like a Ship in the sky and you overlook the whole of Singapore from the deck and can take amazing photos. It was fantastic and Singapore is stunning at night. Even the daytime it is beautiful and clean. Highly recommended!,,
,,Worth the time and money,5,,"The domes are quite pricey but worth the admission fee. The gardens are very beautiful and the design is breathtaking. There is a heavy emphasis on conservation and education. It can be quite cold inside so do bring a jacket.

The cloud forest has an amazing waterfall. It is very humid and cold, so protect your camera and other electronics.

There is a short 15 minute free show at night where the supertrees light up with music. It's a spectacular view and very worth watching.

I didn't have any trouble with insects but it would be wise to apply insect repellent just in case.",,
,,Just the 2 of us,5,,"We did this on 2 seperate days. The first visit was at night to see the ""Super Trees"" & the light show to music, which was wonderful. The 2nd trip was during the day & we visited the 2 domes firstly the Cloud Forest which was exceptional, beautiful and worth every minute & hundreds of photo's. They had some lovely artwork set amongst the plants. Secondly we went to the flower Dome & as they were setting up for a new exhibition it was very nice but we had been truly spoilt by the Cloud Dome. We then went for a walk through to the Super Trees & for about S$8each a short trip in a lift to the Super Tree Walk Amongst The Clouds....STUNNING",,
,,Amazing experience,5,,Beautiful safe manicured gardens would recommend at night. Friday night had a light to music show. Highly recommended,,
,,Money Well Spent,4,,"Millions of dollars have been invested in these new gardens and the result is a spectacular merging of architecture and flora from around the world.

The two class houses are great attractions and tell two very different stories of rain forests and the flower kingdom

The parks credentials on sustainability are a very important part of its story creating its own energy from totally renewable sources.

The super trees are a great work of engineering and an amazing feature on the landscape.

The best part is that over time the park will mature and get better. This not an alternative to the original botanical gardens they are both a must see when in Singapore and both have a different and important spin on the world of plants and tree.

One downside is the use of tackie LEGO and plastic creatures in some areas, this really is not needed and goes against the sustainability message

,,"Just a wow place to be with your partner, friends and family!",5,,"I just absolutely love this place, the visuals especially illuminated at night, the acoustics + the walk up high amongst the tree tops + footway bridges linking the tree tops. Great views of Singapore + quite emotional experience, it's a truly beautiful place to visit but get there when it's dusk but before the entrance to the tree tops closes as it is so beautiful + memorable. Would return + it reminds me of Avatar's tree of life, nice!!",,

,,Great views,4,,"I wasn鈥檛 very impressed with the Domes, but going up the garden flowers (I think that鈥檚 what they are called) has a great view. Would defiantly recommend doing.",,
,,Beautiful wonderful light display with astounding music,4,,Comparable to any national gardens this well landscaped green lung in the heart of the financial centre is must visit site. Plenty to do and see with a special children section. Fascinating flower dome and tropical forest indoor buildings. At night there are 2 special light display first class music accompaniment. Magic. What a lovely gardens by the bay,,
,,One Word ......Beautiful,5,,"Spend at least 3-4 Hours and best time to start visit is between 03:00-04:00 pm, as scorching heat will be taken care and after 03-04 hours at time of exiting one can enjoy Garden rhapsody (light and sound show) which start at around 07:40 pm and another one at 08:40 pm.
Big man made Waterfall in Cloud forest is very beautiful.",,
,,An unique man-made air-conditioned garden.,4,,"With an humid climate in Singapore all year round, visitors have no worry visiting this beautiful man-made garden... The view in the day and night is totally different. so suggest to visit around 5pm till 9pm... Kim Jong Un has recently visited this place so it is definitely a place worth visiting.",,
,,Preferred flower dome than cloud forest,4,,Went with toddler and it was pleasantly cooling both in CF and FD given the warm weather in sg in May!,,
,,Gorgeous Gardens by the Bay,5,,"I never tire of the Gardens by the Bay, despite having visited more than a dozen times, as a proud Singaporean.
This is a unique and world class attraction NOT to be missed in Singapore, made extremely affordable for the rest of the the world to enjoy too.
Both the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest can be enjoyed in either rain and shine, so one can always plan on visiting them.
Each dome is special in its own rights, so do buy tickets for both these 2 respective Domes.
This time, I tried the informative Outdoor Garden Cruiser tour.
The OCBC Skyway took time to re-open due to inclement weather, but was worth our wait for the spectacular views and Instagram moments.
Our Holland guest enjoyed the Gardens tremendously, and was suitably impressed.
I loved the Gardens so much again, that I upgraded my ticket to an annual pass instead.
Having visited 47 other countries, there really is no similar sight / comparable attraction, to be enjoyed please.
Thank you very much for this Grandiose Gift to Singapore and the World.",,
,,Nice place ... worth a visit,4,,"The gardens by the bay has a huge area. The open parks are free for all. There is a ticket for cloud forest and the flower dome. The cloud forest is very interesting. Its all covered, has a wide variety of plants. An artificial waterfall. Loads of walking. But its convenient as the whole area is air conditioned and not the usual weather of singapore. The flower dome has a wide variety of flowers. But it will be more interesting for the botany students or those having knowledge about the subject.
Late evening, the super tree grove and other place is lighted up. And do watch out for the light and sound show timings and the place... so that it isn't missed.
Cloud forest is the main attraction here and is worth it",,
,,Nice place,5,,Nice place to visit in Singapore. Good environment with lots of tourists. Photography place . Nice maintenance.,,
,,Flowers,3,,Was told I had to go here. It was impressive even though it wasn't really my cup of tea. Some of the displays were simply amazing.,,
,,Spectacular Singapore gardens!!,5,,"The gardens are immense and free with many places to sit or to explore. You have to pay to visit the Cloud Dome and Mist Forest. Pensioners and student rates apply. Good rainy day activity. The mist forest is amazing with wonderful ferns, orchids and insects eating plants. Wonderfully constructed with easy paths to wander through. The flower dome is pretty and has a wealth of flora - from succulents and baobabs to a current colorful display of begonias. Accessible to differently baked people. Highly recommended",,
,,Travel in Style,5,,What a wonderful place. As a gardener I was blown away by the extent of varieties and plantings. My husband was blown away by the architecture and the recycling concepts. We loved the whole place. This is a definite to visit if you love plants.,,
,,Amazing Gardens by the Bay,5,,Gardens by the bay was absolutely stunning. Sadly we only went through one of the domes as we ran out of time. A good reason to return! The light show at night was very dramatic and beautiful. The setting is very picturesque and you can easily spend the day/night here. When you are finished exploring visit Satay by the Bay for some delicious food!,,
,,Someonres Exceptional Dream,4,,"We started our day on the tour round the park on the buggy so we didn't miss any of the areas and went from there Cloud Dome, Flower Dome and night light show All a wonderful experience must have been created by a mind full of imagination.",,
,,Gardens,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is an amazing place to visit during day for its natural part and walks inside and night time for lights, music etc and walk too.",,
,,It's out of this world...,5,,Simply amazing... the entire complex is perfectly maintained... cool interior and beautiful sceneries...,,
,,Great Evening Experience - and free!,4,,"Expect to be surrounded by crowds, especially on a Friday night - but definitely worth a visit and can also walk around Gardens by the Bay at no cost, or opt in for the skywalk or flower dome and pay for what you want to see. Would recommend the skywalk but best to arrive early as line can reach 1 hour waiting time close to the light show. Easy to access via the MRT and reasonably well signed.",,
,,Amazing!,5,,"What a beautiful space to visit. Take away the millions of people (or what seemed like it) to enjoy nature and the quietness of the area. Every country should have a space like this :) Go at dusk, the best time to see this beauty.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is such a great experience, it has things to please all ages, the light shows are spectacular. If you go anywhere in Singapore you must experience this beautiful spot",,
,,Excellent Place to visit,5,,"It's amazing place to must visit in Singapore which has thousands of various flowers, waterfall, skywalk tree lighten with colourful lights , overall it's memorable experience",,
,,unbelieable,5,,"this park is nice to walk with kids, especially at night. the light show is amazing~ but day time, may be too hot.",,
,,a magical experience,5,,"An absolute must for anyone visiting Singapore, the supertree structures are amazing and if you visit in the evening there is a light show to music which was the highlight of our visit , it is free to enter, the domes cost to enter but are worth the price , there is a shuttle at the ticket booth that will take you to the main area which you will pay for , the gift shop has a great range of products at reasonable prices, the food court has a great range of food or you can just wander at your own pace and take in the beauty of this wonder. the subway is a short walk from here an is well signposted.",,
,,Gorgeous gardens with air conditioning!,5,,Thoroughly enjoyed amazingly beautiful gardens with fountains and colourful displays. Worth a visit.,,
,,Fantastic,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is certainly one of the main attraction in Singapore. The Gardens are located near the waterfront and include the Flower Dome, Cloud Forest, Super Trees with the surrounding parklands and exhibits. While there is a cost for the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest (both of which are stunning) there is no general entry fee for the surrounding gardens and the Super Trees. Be sure not to miss the nightly Garden Rhapsody in the Super Tree Grove, featuring a stunning lightshow to music! Well worth the trip!",,
,,Always lovely,5,,"Second time visiting, always amazing. Love how well it is maintained and what has been achieved. Perfect for the family, couple, all ages.",,
,,Singapore experiance,5,,"Its a marvel both the domes, firstly the architecture & engineering of the place. And I think its the best indoor vegetation I have seen so far. Its a must visit, secondly at the end of the day the light show is worth a mention also.Brvo!",,
,,Reasonable outing,4,,Good 5 hour activity. Best to enter with express pass as queues are excessive. Cloud dome gives access to the tropical plants and misting. Set up is nice but bit too artificially done.,,
,,Absolutely the best,5,,Gardens by the bay is really exceptional. You have to pay to go into the 2 domes but it is well worth it. It is amazing what they have done in the way of gardens within the space provided. We stayed for the light and music show of the super trees and again worth staying for.,,
,,Awesome,5,,Came last year and didn鈥檛 do the indoor greenhouses...BIG Mistake! We did them this year and were simply awestruck! The cloud house with the indoor waterfall is simply amazing! Well worth the trip!,,
,,What an experience!!,5,,"We spent all day here, so although it cost $28 each to visit the two conservatories, it was well worth the money. My camera never stopped clicking all day. In particular I loved the Flower Dome with beautiful sculptures hiding in between the gorgeous plants and flowers! Also wonderful views of Singapore鈥檚 skyline across the bay! The gardens are free and after lunch we wandered around until it was time to go back to our hotel. Not to be missed!",,
,,Great excursion to enjoy some nature encased in interesting landmark architecture,4,,"The gardens are a nice getaway for any group. No problem with children, wide open spaces and beautiful variety of tropical plants. For tourists from cooler countries, the cooled conservatories are perfect to cool off, while the skywalk offers great photo opportunities. Perfect place to go for a calmer day in between the city buzzle.

Don't forget to bring (student) ID for discounts (resident/senior) and a light sweater if you're sensible to the temperature shift when entering the cooled conservatory.",,
,,Stunning Gardens.,5,,"Gardens by the bay is simply stunning. The Supertrees as they call them are just amazing. There is a laser and light show every night to music. Get there early. Although we didn鈥檛 have time to do it there is a walk way between the trees which looks fun.
We only had time to go in evening, but you need most of day to walk around these beautiful gardens. Well worth a visit.",,
,,Awesome,5,,We had a long walk around the gardens it was awesome lots to see there are amazing wood sculptures a must see,,
,,Well worth a visit,5,,"Very enjoyable with a large variety of plant life, a wide range of cactuses. Situated under a fully enclosed canopy.",,
,,Probably better at night,4,,"I like one-of-a-kind attractions and Gardens by the Bay did not disappoint. You can walk around the grounds for free, but to go up to the catwalk you have to pay. Even though the cost was more than I expected, it was worth it. You have great views of the city and get to look over the entire Gardens. While on the catwalk, I thought it would be more beautiful seeing the city lights as well as the Gardens which are also lit at night. It would also be cooler!",,
,,Super fabulous!,5,,We spent the day at the gardens by the bay. The super trees are amazing. Loved the flower dome and the tropical dome. The evening show is unique to say the least!,,
,,South East Asia Adventures,5,,These are stunning gardens in a busy city. Really worth a visit and things fo rthe whole family to do. .,,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,"Great place to visit and walk around, a lot of opportunities for some cool pictures. The light and music show is a must see as well, 7:45pm and 8:45pm are normally the times of it!",,
,,A Walk Through Paradise,5,,"Me and my family visited the 鈥楪ardens by the Bay鈥?during our recent holiday in Singapore. We went to the 鈥楩lower Dome鈥?and the 鈥楥loud Forest鈥?which were really fascinating! The 鈥楩lower Dome鈥?had the most exotic flowers we had ever seen. The 鈥楻ose Wall鈥?was beautiful and had plenty of colors of roses that we had never seen before. The second attraction, the 鈥楥loud Forest鈥?had the largest indoor waterfall we had ever seen. There was a bridge that winded around the tall 鈥榩lant wall鈥?and the waterfall. Plus, the architecture of the dome was outstanding! And last but definitely not least, the Super Tree Grove. It was an unreal sight! It seemed like you were in some alien world! The best time to see the Super Trees would probably be after sunset as you can see the dazzling lights on it. In conclusion, the 鈥楪ardens by the Bay鈥?was extremely beautiful and fascinating and was definitely something I would not want to miss out on. One comes out of this dome feeling refreshed and detoxed.",,
,,Amazing,5,,The night time light and music show is phenomenal and well worth a visit. Also a great view of the nearby hotel,,
,,Splendid!,5,,"We visited Gardens by the Bay in May 2018.

We bought the tickets to see both domes. Both the domes are air conditioned. So It was a lovely walk around inside.

Flower Dome - Spectacular and innovative. It was amazing to see such a huge display of flowers and plants from the Mediterranean and semi-arid regions.

Cloud Forest - Explored the tropical highlands amidst orchids, pitcher plants and ferns from the cool-moist Tropical Montane region. The indoor waterfall at 35 meters was amazing, it descends through the surreal mist-filled Cloud Walk and Treetop Walk.

Our son got bored, however, it was a nice way to spend a couple of hours leisurely strolling.",,
,,Spectacular & Educational,5,,If you love plants and gardening then you will love Gardens by the Bay. A very impressive set up and such beautiful flowers and plants everywhere but in the domes especially.,,
,,The Night Light Show,5,,"We visited Gardens by the bay in the evening when it was a little cooler. The lit trees were intriguing and the pretty mushrooms made the gardens very interesting. We didn鈥檛 pay for any activities, just wandered around. Luckily we came upon the amazing light show set to music. We sat and watched this light show, enchanted by the changing lights accompanied by music. I recommend it to people of all ages. We took a taxi there but it is also easy to reach by metro. There are also a selection of food outlets there.",,
,,Spectacular,5,,"You may not have the time to traipse through the 200 odd acres that comprise Gardens by the Bay, but you must not miss the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest.
The Cloud Forest has a humongous man-made mountain with a cascading waterfall.
The Flower Dome is home to plants and flowers from different regions of the world, from cacti to baobabs to olive trees, all beautifully arranged and displayed.
And of course, one cannot help but be awed by the grove of Supertrees that are living, breathing monuments that support a whole host of plant life.",,
,,Great addition to the city,5,,You could spend hours here.... there is so much to see or you can just relax in the beautiful surroundings. Entry is free although special exhibitions require tickets. As well as the serious collection of plants there are also the quirky structures which compliment the plants.,,
,,lovely gardens - nice way to spend an afternoon,5,,"We bought the tickets to see both domes. It was a lovely walk around inside. The domes were air conditioned, which was nice in the Singaporean heat. Beautiful flowers and plants everywhere. Young kids might be a bit bored with this but it was a nice way to spend a couple of hours leisurely strolling.",,
,,Beautiful garden,4,,"Beautiful garden, but too crowded. Ticket price slightly overpriced also. Worth a visit, a good place for tourist.",,
,,Conference social evening,4,,Enjoyed light dinner and drinks in the dome at the Gardens by the Bay. The gardens were delightful even on a very hot and sultry evening. Quite a magnificent collection of plants from around the world.,,
,,Must go,5,,For tourist Must visit! Itz amazing place! Specially night time when light down the real picture will come out,,
,,"Ok place, wouldn鈥檛 head back",3,,"We visited gardens by the bay after visiting the botanical gardens the day before. My preference was the botanical gardens. Whilst the gardens are lovely and well kept, it lacks a real nature feel, and wasn鈥檛 a whole lot to look at. Probably better for families. Gets busier as the day goes and further takes away the natural feel.",,
,,Fantastic,5,,Fantastic place. It seems like an imaculated place where everything has one purpose and feets perfectly in all the gardens and sights that you can visit. We didn't had the chance of visiting the payed places and just saw the free area but it's worth it. But what you can't miss are the fantastic tree show by night. Its fabulous. I highly recommend.,,
,,amazing experience,5,,"a place of magic , there is no word to describle how beautiful it was, an amazing place to visit !!!!",,
,,Best thing to do in Singapore!,5,,"A great way to spend a day, even if you are my non-plant loving husband! Such an incredible selection of plants, the domes are incredible, and a fab place to wander both outdoor and indoors. We spent all day in the Gardens, including lunch and dinner onsite (Satay by the Bay - YUM) and the evening light show. Worth the entrance fee, and will definitely go again next time we are in Singapore!",,
,,Excellent garden,5,,we like very much the gardens and environment... my family enjoyed the every movement... Best views and nice experience..,,
,,Holiday,5,,"So nice to walk around the gardens on a hot day, nice and relaxing and good if you have kids. Lots of beautiful flowers and tropical plants.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"We visited here to go and see the cloud forest. The tickets are very reasonably priced.

The cloud forest begins by the waterfall, you then take a lift up to the top and spiral back down to the ground looking at the canopy from all different levels.

This was not something you see in the UK, and therefore was an excellent experience.",,
,,Amazing,5,,A visit of Singapore is unthinkable without visiting this site. Life is all around and you can truly feel how much nature is beautiful and in the same time fragile.,,
,,Outing with children,5,,"The children loved their outing, especially the driveless car. They like the cold conservatories as well, so much things to see and explore.",,
,,Spectacular Garden,5,,"One of Singapore's most popular attraction is Gardens by the Bay is a nature park & the park consists of three waterfront gardens, Bay South Garden, Bay East Garden and Bay Central Garden. The largest of the gardens is Bay South Garden. This place is huge. To visit the outdoor garden there is no entry free.It has two cooled conservatories 鈥?the Flower Dome & the Cloud Forest. Both are very large and the Flower Dome is the world's largest column less glasshouse.",,
,,Gardens by the bay review,5,,Must see attraction for people of all the age groups. Best to visit during day light. Minimum 1.5 hours required to cover the garden entirely. Toilets and restaurants are nearby. No entry fee or dress code for the garden. Good to visit during day light. One can take lots of photos.It is right outside the Bay Front MRT.,,
,,"well worth the visit, totally amazing",5,,"beautiful gardens, plenty to see you could spend most of the day here. my only negative feedback is there could be better signage, we found their directional signs a little confused, some were around the wrong way and they should provide maps at the entrance from Marina Bay Sands.",,
,,Amazing!,5,,The light show at night is like being at Disneyland! Loved every minute of it! For a better view stand under the 3 trees or go to the top of the one with a bar for a drink!,,
,,Must see,4,,When you visit Singapore you must visit Gardens by the Bay. In the evening around 8pm there is the lighting show for kids and adults. You can't go past without visiting this colourful garden.,,
,,Flowers,4,,Singapore is a green country which covered in most part by flowers and trees this garden has spatial design of flowers and extremely beautiful .,,
,,Cloud Dome!,4,,We aren't garden people but reading the reviews we decided to visit gardens by the bay.Didn't visit the gardens but did both the conservatories.The cloud dome is superb and I'm glad we did it.The flower dome seemed a bit lacking in comparison.On its own I'm sure it was good.Guess we aren't flower folk either.Makes for nice pictures.Must do the walkway which has a seperate entry.The views were stellar.We stayed back for the supertree grove light and sound show.Was okhay- ish with all the looking up and straining neck!The vantage point is only if you willing to lie down and watch the show.We took an audio guide for the 2 domes but didn't land up using it.Better to enjoy it visually-a feast for your eyes.,,
,,Great Place to Visit!!!,5,,"The Garden of the Bay is one of the top tourist attraction in Singapore.One should not miss Flower dome or Cloud Forest as both the place bring you close to the nature in the same place.
Flower Dome: An amazing place where one can experience the nature's delight of different countries. Beautiful collection of flowers of different countries.
Cloud Forest: It showcase the natural flora based on the height of the land above sea level. One can see the change in natural flora once we start moving up in the mountains.

Tips: Visit this place in day time as it offers better view (Do carry something to wear on as its pretty cold inside)

The ticket cost SGD$38 (Buy it from tours and travel firms in little India or China town as you would get it discounted price)",,
,,If You aqre in Singapore you have to visit there gardens even if you dont like plants LOL,5,,"A place to visit day and or night , the atmosphere is fantastic. Light, colour music, food stalls all there .easy to get to from Bay front MRT station and you can see a few more iconic attraction while you are in that part of town, Including The Sky Garden at MBS Hotel 54 th floor to see the city and islands beyond. day and night are a must .The sky cloud is also amazing and air conditioned , a good way to cool off and see some amazing plants and a massive waterfall .",,
,,Fabulous,5,,We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and definitely recommend as a must visit attraction when in Barcelona,,
,,"Beautiful flowers, plants, amazing discoveries!",4,,"It is rather a surprise to find a jewel of creativity and a good collection of nature鈥檚 delights in a highly built up city state like Singapore. The plants and trees are beautifully presented and displayed, and you have a huge choice of places to visit on this large garden, from a fun Kiddies playground with creative water play features, to outdoor and indoor, ground and sky level views. My personal favourites are the Dome and the Cloud, where it鈥檚 cool, and every season, there are new flowers n plants for your enjoyment. You may wish to bring a cardigan with you if you love plants, as it gets very cool if you are inside there for a long period of time. There are cafes, restaurants, and even an open air food court, with yummy charcoal grilled Satay - Meat on skewers, nicely marinated with local herbs and spices. Be sure to wear comfortable walking shoes as there is a lot of ground to cover.",,
,,Great place to visit,5,,"Great place to visit, especially Cloud forest and Flower Dome in the morning (dont forget to bring warm clothes). Shoul visit at 8pm to enjoy music show at super trees as well.",,
,,Outstanding !!,5,,"The word is outstanding ! This place consists of two domes the flower dome and the cloud forest. Personally I liked the cloud forest a little ahead of flower dome. The flower dome has ever possible flower of the world is a temperature controlled area, extremely beautiful even in peak summers. The cloud forest a marvel I would say.. seven floors of flora and waterfall with misting every two hours. Not to miss I must say but keep your walking shoes handy !! Lot of walking involved.",,
,,Magical Paradise,5,,"These gardens are spectacular! Visited both domes & got WOWed over and over again. Even if you choose not to spend the dollars entering the domes, the gardens are just amazing. Plenty of choice from food outlets, well signed good pathways, and despite being there on a busy Sunday, a lovely calm ambience made the whole experience a totally relaxing day. Well done Singapore! Note also that as domes are climate controlled, they are a lovely comfortable dehumidified temperature.",,
,,Superb place with climatised cool atmosphere,5,,Loved the gardens.. beyond all expectations.. must visit when in Singapore especially with kids.. the waterfall is just breath taking.. and we were there during the tulip festival.. the entire concept was just mind blowing!,,
,,If you have a day to spare then sure,3,,"It's a well made garden, with a lot of walk. Yes the trees and plants here are well curated and not easy to grow, all in all I really respect the effort gone in this but if you are on a tight itinerary and unless you're into gardens you could probably strike this one out of your list, having said that if gardens is your thing then this is the benchmark of garden-tech.",,
,,I'd pick the Singapore Botanical Gardens over this,4,,"This was actually the no. 1 reason why I came to Singapore as it still didn't exist the last time I visited and I love plants and gardening. However, I felt the Cloud Forest beautified a rainforest too much that it looked too contrived. I enjoyed the Flower Dome better as I prefer flowers over foliage. Unfortunately, my visit coincided with a predominant display of begonias (and hydrangeas) which, although one of my favorite plants, are common where I'm from. I would have preferred more variety, particularly of flowers from temperate climates. Where are the tulips, lavenders, daisies, mums, various lilies? Even the display of roses was limited. Perhaps the display depends on the season, but what then is the temperature control for? I thought a lot were missing. I'd take the Singapore Botanical Gardens over this one.",,
,,Second visit,4,,I don鈥檛 think you can come to Singapore and not come here for a visit. This was my second visit but first for my wife and even if you are not a garden enthusiast you definitely can still enjoy a stroll through here.,,
,,Beautiful Gardens,5,,We decided to take the train to the Gardens by theBbay such an easy process and about a 10 minute walk once you get to the station to the entrance . The gardens are beautiful and so cool so you can walk around inside and beat the heat outside.,,
,,WOW!,5,,Possibly one of the best displays of flora I've seen. The entire area is full of amazing scenes and the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are definitely worth a visit.,,
,,Take the time to visit,5,,"This is so worth the cost of entry, very interesting and thought provoking. Each of the dimes are climate controlled so it鈥檚 also a welcome break from the heat of the day.",,
,,Very long walk,4,,"It has a lot of gardens, from Chinese, Malay, India, even Europe, etc. You can also find supertrees there. During school vacation, there is Children Festival there. This place is FREE, but if you wanna visit Flowers Dome or Cloud Forest, you have to pay. It is good at night, because has light show (7.45 pm and 8.45). You can also cross the Dragonfly Bridge to go to Marina Bay Sands to see the Spectra show (it has casino too).",,
,,Unbelievable show,5,,"My favorite place in SG. The most beautiful night show which I have seen! Also the atmosphere is nice, just quite crowded during the night. Definitely recommending this place.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,So much to see and do. Definitely pay to see the cloud forest- just stunning. We were there for hours and still didn鈥檛 see everything. Beautiful place,,
,,unique place,5,,"Very nice to visit, walk around, get rest a bit. Nowhere else you can see such an idea of garden and amazing creation of this vision.",,
,,Trip the light fantastic... If only all cities plugged into a creative reality,5,,"Gardens by the bay

Trip the light fantastic, this 3 dimensional mind, body tripping, so much fun, was one of our highlights - you don鈥檛 need to spend big bucks, infact we took our water and didn鈥檛 spend a cent. Make sure you go pre sunset so you can walk through the part and take in the whole scope of the park and the setup, as it gets close to dark make sure you grab yourself a good spot and take a seat, we left the people of the park below us and walked to a higher level, no more than 8 or so people there but the best viewing and not crammed鈥? Its an easy train ride from where ever - just get off at bayview station.

Such a great example of combining nature with creativity with technology, giving artists the freedom to make something outside of the box- build with passion will always captivate the the hearts and minds of humans, theres no reasons other cities cant have such beauty rather than the boring homoginised greyness which seems to be taking over the mcplanet, you know what Im talking about, same stores, same malls, same brand control - everything and everyone loosing their individual beauty, warts and substance.

Singapore has created a great unique experience that will appeal to city lovers, nature lovers, gardiners, techhy types - young and old of all genders and tastes, a reall oooh ahh experience. I don鈥檛 think you will meet too many people who do not enjoy this and it may say more about them than the Gardens.
'
Trish just reminded me it was not just about the lights (although it was) but there was also many more experiences to be had, sculptures (such as the giant male baby held up by one hand) signage and story..

5 our of 5 Jacuzzi jets from Trish and Jose

THE GOOD
The lights
The show
The nature
The ease of access

THE BAD
If you did want to go up into the tree forest $34 Sin a person or $90 for a family pass - not in everyones reach",,
,,Free day out,5,,"What a great day out for the family....and it's free!!!

We arrived around 4pm as didn't want to be there when it was too hot. They have a fab splash zone for kids (under 12ish!) So don't forget swimmers! Plenty of bits to walk around and see before the amazing light show at 7.15 or 8.15pm.

You can pay to go into the domes but we chose not to as we are close to the Eden Project in the UK and they are similar.

Highly recommended after spending the morning in Bugis we just walked over the bridge",,
,,Nice place to visit during the night time in Singapore,4,,Good display of light and sound during the night time in Singapore. The place was closed by to Marina Sand. Garden Extravaganza started at 20:45 and normally last for 15 minutes.,,
,,Beautiful place to visit,5,,I have not seen these many type of flowers in my life and the way this place is designed is awesome. Both Flower dome and Cloud dome are a must visit place in Singapore.,,
,,Beautiful Garden,4,,"Amazing place, beautiful place, clean and nice garden, a must visit place in Singapore for kids, teen and adults. The lighting of the Super tree Groove is stunning. Our family 3 days vacation is really worth it.",,
,,Do not miss!! Really amazing...No matter how many times I've gone!,5,,The domes are amazing of course and all visitors should go. The evening light show is free and truly unmissable. We bring all out guests and it's a real highlight of their trip. Best light show for sure!,,
,,"A must, fantastic experience",5,,The air conditioned place in humid Singapore is a place you will never forget. One of the best landscaping you will ever see,,
,,Beautiful garden,5,,"Altough it鈥檚 not a natural garden, but it鈥檚 very beautiful and very organized. The led lights were also increased the attractiveness during the night. There was a light show around 7pm in the giant trees park.",,
,,Go!,5,,"One minute it's like being in a sci fi setting with futuristic architectural trees glowing with different colours in the early evening sound and light show. The next minute it's like going home as you enter the Flower Dome and there are gardens possibly from your home country - right there in the middle of the tropics. And as you walk from one setting to the next, it is through the balmy evening, trees, flowers, pools and glimpses of one special view to the next.",,
,,Must visit for families,5,,This was a beautiful garden area to see natural and exotic flowers and plants. A great place for children and families.,,
,,A must see in Singapore,4,,"We enjoyed every bit of the garden! It was a great experience. The walk to the cloud forest was amazing. Im scared of heights though, but still forced myself to go through it. Even my 6yo had a blast. It gets pretty cold inside so dont forget to bring a light jacket especially for the kids.",,
,,Outstanding,4,,"Not the Eden Project but a very close second.
If you are visiting Singapore and have a couple of hours to spare then check out this immaculately kept botanical garden. Some stunning displays of plants from all over the planet.
Highlight for me was the dome to the clouds. Very imaginative. Only negative in my mind was the limited plant identification.",,
,,Garden,5,,This garden is amazing and cool. The two domes are well worth a visit and they are air conditioned which made for a very pleasant afternoon on a hot Singapore day,,
,,Visit in the morning,4,,"If you buy both dome then you will get some good discount. Floor dome is very good but over crowded, we can鈥檛 take photo alone, minimum few people will be there in your photo. It is fully air-conditioned dome. It is very small and over crowded.",,
,,Loved the ethos of creating a garden city!,4,,"Excellent huge park with many things to enjoy! A bit busy on Saturday night but enough space for everyone to enjoy. Particularly liked the lights and music show in the evening at the Supertree Grove. If you're looking for a quiet place, you can have a picnic with a view of the city @Marina Barrage.",,
,,What an incredible afternnon,5,,An excellent way to get out of the heat and humidity of the afternoon. Lots to see and a fantastic selection of flora from around the world. Pre booked online.,,
,,nice garden,5,,nice place to visit. a lot of flower and plants. suitable for kids and old age. suitable for exercise tooo...,,
,,Garden theme park,5,,"I鈥檝e never thought of public gardens or parks as being in the same category as Wonder World / Water World or Disneyland before but - hey, this is Singapore!! There are light shows that come on at sunset with illumination of huge steel sculptural trees. Shuttle buses equipped with audio commentary zip people through the many differently themed gardens, passing signs to 鈥楨nid Blyton鈥檚 Magic Faraway Tree鈥? and a huge conservatory groups plants from countries all over the world. Gardens by the Sea receives huge numbers of visitors but there are no queues and it鈥檚 easy to wander around at your own pace. Educational and fascinating (if bordering on high kitch). Well worth a visit!",,
,,Cool Escape Capped By Evening Lights,5,,In hot Singapore a late afternoon visit through the air conditioned Flower Dome and Cloud Forest is a cool escape and an amazing display of plants. We then had a nice dinner in one of the restaurants by the super trees before finding a good view spot to enjoy the light and music show at 7:45 pm. The taxi line was long but still got back you our hotel by 930. We missed many of the outdoor gardens but we were happy with our visit.,,
,,Botanical Tropicana,5,,"Fascinating - there are 2 conservatory domes which have seperate entrances , once inside the ""Garden . Visit Flower dome first and at the end of this through the shop will be enterance to the Cloud Forest . This educational theme park has some added ""Hollywood "" but thats just part of the journey. Magnificent plant displays, extremely old and very large olive trees, tiny succulents and exquisite wooden sculptures just a taste of what is on display in this educational theme park .
Bar atop the super tree worth the $20 fee for the view!",,
,,Short stay,5,,This is an amazing place to visit. Although we only had a short time in Singapore it is definitely a must see.,,
,,Mus visit place,5,,"one should visit in evening and see the light and sound show. Its free. Ypu have to pay to vsit two dome. Dome gives surreal experiece - how a manmade structure can feel so real and natural. visiting two dome in a day could be tiring, so if you have more good time, do one dome per day. Super trees are brilliantly design; skywalk is spectacular.",,
,,Gardens by the bay,5,,"It is rightly said Singapore is a city in gardens not gardens in city. This is one of the beautiful place developed, very informative. Engaging for all age groups from kids to grandparents. Second visit recommended as it is not possible to cover this place in 2-3 hours. They have splendid Collection of plants, flowers & trees.",,
,,Visit Garden by the Bay - Cooled Conservatories!!,4,,"Spectacular attraction! Visit the two conservatories - the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. The Supertree Groove is also a part of this garden. Tickets are available at the counters.
The Cloud forest has the world鈥檚 tallest indoor waterfall, you can also see a wide array of beautiful flowers.
There is a light show in the evening but we could not wait until then. You can see the garden at your own pace on foot or take a driver driven buggy by paying additional Singapore 3 $. The flowers are a feast for the eyes specially for nature lovers.",,
,,More crowded than two years ago,3,,I visited here two years ago. That time this venue was a new attraction. This year many people were there. Too many.. it was not bad but I missed more quiet and clean Gardens by the Bay. The light show was as good as the past鈥檚.,,
,,Refreshing walk through a misty garden,5,,"Of the two domes, Cloud Dome is generally more entertaining. It is a breath of fresh air to walk through mist and richly diversified arrangements of wall-lined foliage. You can easily spend an hour exploring each dome.",,
,,SUPERB,5,,We had a family vacation in Singapore for 4 days... The garden was really beautiful and super clean... it鈥檚 very accessible and it鈥檚 good to tour around.. it feels like you are in a different dimension... It鈥檚 vast but it鈥檚 good for sightseeing and it鈥檚 enjoyable to walk around... we enjoyed every moment... People are so friendly everywhere....,,
,,Gardens are not really my thing...but It was hard not to be drawn into the beauty of the flowers on show,5,,My son loved finding the dragons in the domes. The waterfall was pretty impressive and the temperature in both domes was really comfortable. The setting for Gardens by the bay is great and is well run and maintained.,,
,,A must see during the day and at night,5,,"With limited time, we were only able to explore the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. Both were spectacular with the Tulips and Orchids in bloom. We came back to see the Super Tree show as part of our hop on, hop off bus night tour. If you want to explore the gardens at night, I would recommend doing the Super Tree show on your own as on the tour, there was only time to see the 15 minute light & sound show then we were back on the bus.",,
,,An awesome experience!,5,,"The Flower Dome and Cloud Forest were truly delightful. It was such a pleasure to see such a large display of flora representing Australia, and countries from all around the world.",,
,,A must see!,5,,This is a must see when you visit Singapore. Lots of beautiful and unique flowers. They also have man made waterfalls inside.,,
,,Must See at Night,5,,The light show kicks off at 7:45 pm and goes for about 20 minutes. If you want to enter the domes do at least one of them before the light show and then shake a leg and get to the otherone immediately after the show because the last entry is meant to be at 8:00 pm.... they let us in at 8:15 pm but don't always rely on that.,,
,,Fantastic gardens of the world,5,,"Great place to spend a few hours walking around , some fantastic nature and plant life. Very good educational tour for kids and adults alike. Would recommend.",,
,,Heaven on Earth,5,,"My second visit within a year...A Must See Place..well connected by MRT..get down at Bay Front MRT...you can take a coach for 3 SD..You can buy tickets online for Flower Dome, Cloud Forest & OCBC Sky Walk..cheaper online..Flora of all regions can be seen under controlled environment... beautiful water falls..lessons on environmental protection...all about rainforest n water conservation..walk on the Skyway is heavenly...for me it is never tiring..will definitely come again n again !",,
,,Stunning,5,,"A vast area so be sure to wear your walking shoes. It's incredible and amazing and even for someone who isn't that interested in plants, I was in awe of what this place delivered. I'd recommend you don't go to Singapore without visiting.",,
,,stunning...magic happens,5,,Well from the moment i stepped into these stunning gardens i felt transformed into a futuristic movie scene. the gardens are gorgeous from the flower dome such a beautiful array of colour and aromatics to the mystic cloud forest where magic happens. the super trees are awesome solar powered creating this calm but power at the same time. needless to mention the rhapsody light show is a must see truly transforming i suggest you sit on the lawn to really appreciate the dancing lights! another amazing feature of the gardens is the sustainability they use recycle water to keep the garden fresh and alive... well done!!!,,
,,Very nice and quiet place with all the plants from all over the world,5,,"It is a very nice place to visit. It consists of two dimes that stock all the plants of the world. The first dome has a waterfall and you can see it from the bottom or high up. The second some has very nice displays, which from time to time.",,
,,Nice place,5,,"Really nice place to relax see the garden and a lot of variety of plantsman, I really enjoy the garden",,
,,Amazing day!,5,,We loved this. The domes were spectacular and worth every penny. It鈥檚 really special and worth a visit.,,
,,Lovely,4,,"Lovely natural scenic views. A definite picture point. Musical shows in the evening you should not miss them. Please check the timings as that might change depending which season you are going in.
The one we enjoyed was 7:30pm. Sit and relax in the evening after tiring day out.",,
,,Can't Wait to Return!,5,,"We just loved Gardens by the Bay. It's free to enter the gardens, but you have to pay to enter the domes and skywalk. We went at night and saw the light show. It was spectacular, a great experience. Loved every minute of it. It's a must-see when in Singapore. We ran out of time otherwise we would have returned to see it in the daytime. Will definitely be visiting again next time we're in Singapore.",,
,,"Worth a look, particularly on a hot day.....",4,,"We enjoyed the gardens and flower atrium, all very well done....popular with locals and tourists and a great spot to escape the heat for a couple of hours....the wooden animal statues were a highlight.",,
,,Gonna die a happy man!,5,,"As part of a visit to Singapore...OK the main reason to come to this wonderful part of the world....We set a day aside to visit Garden's by the Bay. My expectations were high based on previous feedback. Off we went via the easy to use MTR system...please don't let me down Garden's by the Bay.
From the moment I entered the complex I was overwhelmed. The whole destination is mind blowing. The gardens, the layout, presentation was far beyond my wildest hopes. As a plantaholic and garden groupie I still found it sensational. I have spent many years in the horticultural industry both working and studying but was still not prepared for the learnings and affirmations gained by spending a day at the Garden's by the Bay. And the light show at the end....well that was the icing on the cake!",,
,,Indeed Its Garden,5,,"This Place is Must Visit where you can see all the flowers in around the world, Crowds are best managed . Use CC to buy the tickets , If booked online please carry your original Credit Card.",,
,,Nice hangout for families,5,,It鈥檚 a great location for taking a walk in the evening and to enjoy the free super tree grove musical sound and light show. Great place for kids and families,,
,,Singapore family holiday,5,,"As a 42 year old male I am not what you would call a garden enthusiast, the Gardens by the Bay however were a highlight of my 10 day trip! Not only during the day to see both the Flower Dome (7 out of10) and the Cloud Forrest (10 out of 10) but also the night to see the light show that is in every night for 15min (7:45pm and 8:44pm)
The family also concur - Mum and the 10yo Daughter and 7yo Son, something for everyone",,
,,Awesome experience,5,,This is one of the attraction in Singapore ... The dome Nd the gardens is splendid to watch .. in nite the dome gets light which changes again Nd again Nd the atmosphere is superb to watch ... This is must watch if u traveled to Singapore it will take around 3-4 hrs to see this attraction .... So keep the time with u Nd Njoy,,
,,Thoughtful and exemplary creation,5,,A delightful journey into the world of flora and fauna. An amazing recreation and collection of plants in their habitat.,,
,,Mind blowing,5,,My biggest regret here is that we didn鈥檛 have time to visit the domes. The light show at 8.00pm is a wonderful experience. We didn鈥檛 know what to expect and when it started you can鈥檛 help but be spellbound with the lights and music. If you could rate this attraction higher I would. An added bonus is that this is a free activity.,,
,,Visit,4,,"Attended attraction as part of tour(RMG Tours).Guide was named QT he was impressive. Attraction was spectacular , light show impressive. Must see if staying enough time in Singapore",,
,,Very beautiful and good for the Lionmaid City,4,,A very attractive and original garden and part of well designed development of Singapore's Bayfront area together with the casino and shopping complex.,,
,,Pleasant day outing,4,,It gives mental satisfaction and pleasure spending a day with family in Gardens by the Bay. Local's as well foreigners should not miss out. Flowers collection some of them is not fresh otherwise all good spending a day with family. Some seating arrangements can be made especially for Seniors to sit and watch the light show.,,
,,The cloud forest is mindblowing,5,,"With our family in tow we had and amazing day here. Both our parents and children enjoyed it. Flowers for the oldies, cloud forest for us all and the free water splash park for the littles. The cloud forest is one of the most amazing man made attractions I have seen in the world. The attractions are air con which is a blessing and satay at the bay nearby is great for lunch. Don't forget swimmers/ bathers for the kids.",,
,,It's worthy to visit & night lazer show is so pretty,4,,"This attractive although will charge you some money, but still worthy to visit!

,,Mind blown,5.0,,Wow this place is amazing. My mind was blown over when we visited the two domes. I can't imagine how they made this but it's up there for 7 wonders of the world and Singapore should be very proud. Tonight we go to the night tour which is the outside view. This place is so beautiful and I was moved beyond expectation. Practically wise it's air conditioned and wasn't over populated with tourists so we could move around easily. If coming to this gorgeous city make time to visit here.
,,Amazing,5.0,,Worth visiting both during the day and night. Great show at 19.45 and 20.45"," you should not miss it !""",
,,Highly Recommended,5,,"One of the first attractions I visited in Singapore; Well worth it, beautiful gardens, can spend hours wandering in them, and the domes.",,
,,Not to miss!,5,,"By far...this is my favorite place in all of Singapore. The flower displays are amazing and changed out regularly with the seasons. Allow enough time to just sit and soak in the flowers.The small resteraunt, Pollen, also has the loveliest Sunday tea.",,
,,Worth every penny!,5,,Pay to go in the flower and cloud domes. They are exceptional! A nice cool area in the heat of the day too! Worth heading up to the bar on the top of the tallest supertree for amazing views,,
,,Gardens by the Bay vs Botanic Gardens,3,,"I went to both Botanic Gardens and Gardens of the Bay today. After to have walked + scooted around both parks (even tho it wasnt allowed sometimes) I must say I enjoyed the Botanic Gardens more. Due to the fact that its a REAL garden/park definitly adds a lot of worth. Asides from all the trees, woods, forrests etc there were also big green grassy areas where you could just sit down and relax. I didnt notice any of that in Gardens of the Bay.
It was also more quit and peacefull in the Botanic Gardens and it smelled fresher.
Note, in neither parks did i visit the paid sections so i cant give a review on that...",,
,,Nice Tour,5,,"Visit Gardens by the Bay. The world's premier tropical waterfront garden. Get up close with a diversity of plant species from around the world in the cooled conservatories, marvel at vertical gardens, or discover the intricacies of plant life at the themed gardens",,
,,One word amazing,5,,Even the humid didnt stop us from was amazing. The cloud dome even though a short wait was beautiful from start to finish,,
,,Mind blowing!,5,,"This place was phenomenal! An incredible experience, my husband a builder and myself a gardener we were taken back by the entirety of this place. An absolute must do in Singapore. Overwhelming and mind blowing in creativity and forward thinking!",,
,,Awesome,5,,What a fantastic way of seeing Singapore! Loved the view and scenery.. Will definitely be back the next time to smell the fresh flowers!,,
,,Beautifully Done,5,,"I鈥檓 usually not one for flower gardens and went mainly for my wife鈥檚 enjoyment. I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the exhibits, they were from all over the world and included the flowers and even trees from that area. The wooden sculptures that were dispersed among the exhibits were also very well done.",,
,,Absolutely beautiful,5,,"These gardens are totally amazing. There is so much to see. Take your time and have a really good look around. Even people who are not into gardening will be fascinated. Make sure you stay for the light show, it is unbelievable.",,
,,Stunning Gardens - must see in Singapore,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is absolutely stunning. There's so much to see and do within these gardens during the day & night. Highlights are the Flower Dome, Cloud Forest & the Supertrees. Do not miss the light & sound show at night as you walk on the suspended walkway around the Supertrees.",,
,,Another Special Place in Singapore,4,,"We travelled on the HOHO bus (green line) and saw a stop labelled Gardens by the Bay. We had previously visited the Botanical Gardens and did not know what else to expect, but it was a pleasant surprise.
Unfortunately, it was a public holiday and it was a lot busier than we had anticipated. I don't know if it was the norm but there was a high level of experiences set up for children and it was clearly a great place for families. It seemed like it was a cross between a fun park and some great garden experiences.
We visited the two major domes which housed the man made forested ""mountain"" complete with waterfall and a spiral walkway from the top back down to ground level ... unique and exceptional. And the second dome had flowers from all around the world in national groups which made this just as interesting. More pictures of flowers!
In addition, there was a tree top walk and very good facilities.
Highly recommended.",,
,,Inspiring Nature,5,,"I always feel alive and refreshed surrounded by plants. Gardens by the Bay is just the place, if you are like me, to be revitalized by nature. Walking around the grounds is free of charge for all visitors unless you want to visit any one of the domes ... or both (I would recommend that ... especially the Cloud Dome). If you are enthralled by flowers, the Flower Dome features seasonal flowers ranging from tulips, orchids and roses. This place is worth the visit.",,
,,Cycle,5,,"Best view, best place to cycle, road very big comfortable easy convenience, garden bay the bay inside. Dome very good nice forests. Waterfall amazing",,
,,Beautiful,4,,Fabulous place to visit. Cloud walk is amazing- better than the flower dome. The canopy walk was great too. Lack of tourist info/ advice. We tried to find out when the flower dome lit up but there wasn鈥檛 much anyone could tell us and no one told us to wait around for the light show which was disappointing. Also each thing was an extra cost . I.e. tram trolley and canopy walk was on top of the $28 for the flower dome and the cloud walk. There should be a total charge and ticket for people who want to do the lot . Also no maps given of the huge park. Well worth the visit .,,
,,Mesmerising,4,,"Start at around 6 in the evening super collection of plants and trees, the waterfall is breathtaking ( do go all the way up) later in the evening visit the light show",,
,,Picnic,4,,"Amazing place with beautiful plants & water fountains etc etc at one place . The domes are amazingly beautiful & fine collection of plants . The restaurants are good , fine dining also available. Water play area for kids was immense & good scenic view of Singapore at evening.",,
,,Fascinating place,5,,"There is so much to see in these beautifully composed gardens, which showcase a range of plants and types of gardens. We even saw a wonderful visiting art exhibition, and enjoyed lunch at one of the eateries. So much to experience!",,
,,Don't miss these gardens,5,,We had a one day stopover in Singapore and were so pleased that we visited these gardens. There was a tulip festival in the flower dome plus all the other wonderful plants. We also loved the cloud dome with its wonderful tropical plants.,,
,,Fun place to visit,4,,Beautiful! Don鈥檛 miss the evening light shows at 7.45 and 8.45. The cloud forest was pretty amazing too- about $16 to enter but worth it.,,
,,Best indoor garden I have ever visited.,5,,"I cannot describe the beauty that my eyes feasted on, for hours discovering so many plants from all over the world. Would go back just to see this again.",,
,,Highlight,5,,"Must see in Singapore, if you鈥檝e only got one day, this should be top of your list! Even if your not a fan of gardening this place is outstanding. So well thought out and looked after. We would go back again next time we in Singapore.",,
,,My grandfather was in heaven,5,,My grandfather is an avid photographer. He鈥檚 visiting from India and I came from the U.S. to see my aunt and cousins. My aunt took us here. My grandfather loves flowers and he probably took at least 100 photos. He was like a kid in a candy store. I quite enjoyed myself as well. They have done a beautiful job.,,
,,"worthwhile, beautifull architecture and views",4,,"At the opening gala diner of DGX 2018 (june 4-6) at the Gardens by the bay, with an excellent speech of the minister I had the opportunity to walk around with some of my peers and experience this garden. Lots of flowers, trees and some interesting wooden sculptures (eagle, dragon). Worthwhile to spend more time there, as well for the lovely views at the surrounding water/harbour.",,
,,Loved the gardens by day and the light show at night.,5,,Walk exercise and enjoy the various parts of the gardens by the Bay during the afternoon and then stay for the light show at night. All together well worth the effort and time. Highly recommended.,,
,,family day out,5,,what an experince with amazing views stayed here for many hours enjoyed the whole day out took many many pictures,,
,,pleasure,5,,What an amazing garden.So much to see and do.The roof top bar is a bomb if you are into the best view of Singapore.A very beautiful place and on sunset the place has transforms,,
,,Just awesome!,5,,"The gardens are a perfect example of the Singaporean drive for perfection and engineering feats. We have done a couple of walks around the gardens and whilst they aren鈥檛 huge, they are beautifully done and a complete oasis in the city. The light show at night time is stunning and the cloud forest is a wonderful place to spend an hour.",,
,,"A great combination of Nature, Technology and Architecture",5,,"This place is like a heaven for the naturalists. If you want a break from the world of wild technologies, just stroll through the Outdoor Gardens with living skyscrapers, which is free for everyone. Expend some money and relax your eyes by watching thousands of flowers and other plants in the 'Flower Dome' and 'Cloud Forest'. And when you feel that you've experienced everything, they will present you a mind-blowing lighting show with music in the supertree grove, everyday in the evening, twice. For a full experience in a leisurely way, allocate at least 3 hours for roaming in the afternoon and 1 hour for the evening show. The only thing you might feel uncomfortable with is the huge crowd of people. Otherwise it's worth an experience.",,
,,Stunning,5,,"The Gardens by the Bay are a must if in Singapore for a few days! You need to buy tickets for the Domes on arrival- but queues not long and very efficient staff. Other parts of park are free! You need at least an hour for each Dome. We came in about 4.00pm and had plenty of time for both Domes before going to the light show under the Super Trees at around 7.30pm. This was a superb light and music spectacle and really enjoyable! Domes are stunning! Really beautifully done and lovely and cool so you can walk round in comfort!
All in all a most enjoyable visit and I would thoroughly recommend going.",,
,,Beautiful gardens but literally a concrete jungle,3,,"I have heard so many great things about Gardens by the Bay and so I spent the money for the tickets which I thought was a bit pricey but figured it would be worth it...

I was very surprised to find that it was so much concrete... What kind of garden is that?

It started to really bother me because the gardens claim to be environmentally conscious however there is just so much unneeded, brought in material to a place that is beautiful for nature not construction.

I found the attractions really boring. After about an hour I really wanted to just leave and go do something else. Unless you're really fascinated by botany, it's probably just going to be a quick stop.

I hate to leave an average review on one of the highest rated gardens of the world but I have seen gardens in New Zealand, kept by personal property that had more magic happening than this tourist attraction.",,
,,A must for visitors to Singapore,5,,The gardens are magnificent. It is amazing how they can have centuries old olive trees and fully grown palms growing under the huge domes full of plants from all over the world. It is awe inspiring to walk around and see the beauty of nature.,,
,,Great!,3,,A really beautiful place with very nice gardens landscaped. There are many type of flowers to see and one can spend at least half a day there. Some of the gardens need entrance tickets,,
,,Really cute,4,,Quite pricey but really well run and really cute. Quite cold inside due to high air con so bring something to cover your shoulders. Very beautiful cloud forest and flower dome. Efficient and friendly staff. Gets very crowded but still very big space so doesn't feel as much. Couldn't do the trees due to bad weather.,,
,,Nice place,5,,Must admit i wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised. The light show was quite good and the gardens are nice.,,
,,You have to stay for the lights,5,,"Fantastic day, the park is beautiful and the charge to enter the domes is worth every penny Then the darkness falls and the music and lights show starts, just make sure that you are unde4 the large trees",,
,,A cool oasis in the heat of Singapore,5,,Gardens by the Bay is definitely worth a visit. The two domes are air-conditioned inside which makes a pleasant change from the hot and humid conditions outdoors. The gardens themselves are beautiful and display a selection of plants from around the world. The 35m waterfall is also very impressive.,,
,,So beautiful,5,,"This was definitely one of my favorite places in Singapore. The musical show was so beautiful, with all the lights shinning. Forget the cameras or phones, just enjoy! And even if you just go there during the day, it is still beautiful.",,
,,B E A UUUUTIFUL Place,5,,"Location
Marina bay.

Experience
One of the most beautiful places you will ever see which is man made. Beautifully architectured trees full of greenery, the moment you land in singapore you will find it just green from the airport to the whole city. You can just admire those massive tree structures and say will wwwwoooooww. A must visit place when you are in singapore. No entry fees, There is a restaurant also at the centre tree so you can have drinks and dine with a view, I will go there next time. But while checking the menu it's value for money according to the place. You can reach here by public transport like train, bus, taxi other option is GRAB it's a app like UBER so the car will pick you up from ur destination it's cheap and easy. All the year it's quite hot and humid in singapore with some rain shower so light clothing is the best option always. At the gardens just wait for the evening at 7:45pm the light show starts at this time and it's really worth waiting for it. People started gathering specially for this and this place is full at that time, so better grab ur best space for the best view. This place is really massive and the bridge connecting to the marina bay hotel, another iconic skyscraper of singapore. It's worth going there.

Services
There Is a restaurant in the garden,skytree restaurant with a view which I mentioned already, and little kiosk are also available for the refreshments.

Hope this will be helpful.",,
,,Great views,5,,This was a great experience as there were many photo opportunities and breathtaking view. We spent most our day here admiring the view as there was a lot to see. It was easy to reach by taking the metro and there was also the show at night with the lights which was a great to watch as it was unique and something never seen before. The show was free of charge to watch so it is something to definitely do however the cloud forest and the flower dome have a charge where you will need to buy your ticket but it is worth it. There was also a McDonald鈥檚 in the garden.,,
,,Not to be missed,5,,"You can visit Gardens by the Bay for free and enjoy the scenery, lush landscapes and gardens and views, and watch the twice nightly 'Garden Rhapsody' which is a 15 minute music and light spectacular in the Supertree Grove. You can view this from anywhere in the Grove, head there about 10/15minutes early to get a seat at the edge of one of the ""trees"" or else, you'll end up sitting on the floor - although that isnt so bad in always clean Singapore! You can also view from the Skywalk for an additional cost of 8SGD although personally, I think the view is better from below. Don't go up to the SuperTree by IndoChine bar to see the show, the 20 SGD entrance fee to the rooftop bar (although it includes a drink) does not give you a good view to the show at all - although its a nice place to go for a couple of drinks (which are pricey but in line with most drink prices in Singapore!). You can also pay to visit the Cloud Forest and Flower Forest, a slight discount on purchasing tickets for both but you can do one or the other too. One tip - if you visit in the day time, make sure to come back at night time for a whole new experience - the sight of the trees lit up at night is not to be missed in Singapore!",,
,,Wow,5,,Recently visited here on our honeymoon. Fantastic gardens. The flower dome and cloud forest were unbelievable... great place to get away from the summer humidity too. Highly recommended.,,
,,Spectacular,4,,Spectacular view in night.but be ready to walk and walk and walk.this is architectural marvel don鈥檛 miss it.,,
,,Must see in Singapore,5,,Loved visiting Gardens by the Bay. You can walk around Supertree Grove and the grounds for free - there's lots of wildlife nearby including otters and turtles! I would definitely recommend buying tickets for the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. It's a great place to escape the hustle and bustle of the city and is a very cool temperature inside compared to Singapore's hot air! Also lots of great stuff on the environment and a very effective video on climate change. Fabulous way to spend a couple of hours. Would also recommend visiting at night to see the free light show in Supertree Grove which is equally as amazing!,,
,,If you love garden or flowers go for it,3,,Dont go in the morning you will get dismayed as the towering tree looks plain also the burning heat will make you sit and stay in just one place rather than roaming around the garden. Do visit at night cause this is when the garden comes to life but very artificial. This is something I would not be really keen on visiting it just happened to be near Marina Bay Sanda that's why we had a quick stop. But seriously the heat will make you get out of there really quick.,,
,,Must visit place in Singapore,5,,Came here during our visit to Singapore in October. Amazing place to be at. Good for evening strolls. Lovely view. Amazing ambience. No words can do proper justice to this place. Highly recommended and one of the top of the top most places to visit when in Singapore.,,
,,outstanding day out,5,,"This place is spectacular, make sure you organise your timings so you can spend some time in the clouds and stay late to watch the free sound and light show",,
,,Beautiful,5,,Extremely beautiful and well-planned park. There's something for everyone here. Would definitely recommend getting the ticket to go to the top of the trees for some breathtaking views.,,
,,Average garden display,3,,The waterfall was the highlight - not a huge variety of flowers compared to botanical gardens It was nice to escape the humidity but was disappointed with the variety of colour in the gardens,,
,,Amazing,5,,If you are only going to visit one place in Singapore then this is it. The evenings have light and sound displays which are out of this world and even better - NO entry fee,,
,,A wonder of nature right in the city!,5,,"The Gardens themselves are free to access, very well tended to, quite large and beautifully laid out. It is a treat just to walk among such nature. The two biodomes are marvelous and well worth the entry fee: truly a marvel of engineering to protect such natural beauty and diversity. Come early to beat the crowd!",,
,,Beautiful Sight,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is a free open garden with a light show at night, I went with a tour which included this and had a lovely time.
The light show was spectacular, for adults and children alike.
Only one lift to the walk above, and a rather long queue, but as it鈥檚 open all day and until 10pm, you can go there as often as you like.
Cafes and restaurant is there for many food and drink options.
What a delightful, beautiful place, NOT to be missed.",,
,,Gardens By The Bay,3,,"Its a really nice place with lots of scenic attractions and most importantly lots of greenery. Its a good place for children and its a cool place, especially with the heat in Singapore during the months of April, May and June",,
,,Amazing tourist attraction w/Flowers,5,,"Singapore is the greenest city I鈥檝e ever visited and actually the greenest city in Asia! Gardens on the Bay was enjoyable and efficient. Even though I knew there were crowds, it did not feel crowded due to the smart layout. It is an indoor garden/greenhouse, so every type of orchid and flowers are to be admired and photographed.

It is a giant rain forest with a huge waterfall greeting you at the entrance.",,
,,Simply stunning,4,,"Beautiful gardens to walk around with a stunning Lilly pond with turtles and fish.

There are places to eat of you wish. Toilet facilities have water fountains so you can refill your water bottles.

Gift shop sells some stunning items.

A beautiful place to visit even without paying entry to the flower dome or waterfall.",,
,,Simply fantastic,5,,"We were stopping in the Marina Sands Bay for 4 nights, and there is easy access from there. We spent the whole day there, and when we visited, it was pretty quiet. Got to see the Flower dome, Cloud forest dome, walk way,Super tree grove, evening light show, (get there early) and just spent ages just wandering around. Plenty of place to eat, We had lunch and supper in the food court. One of the highlights of our trip",,
,,A Must Watch Place to see,5,,Awesome place to visit in Singapore. The flower dome and cloud dome are truly fantastic. The varieties of flowers and cactus and the way of decorating the same are truly speechless. The evening show was awesome and will remember for lifetime.... Thank you!!!,,
,,Flora galore,4,,"Oh just beautiful. Bought via 鈥榢look鈥?to gain entry into cloud forest and dome. Otherwise garden onset is free. 2 night supertree grove light shows at 8-30 and 9-30 pm, of oyrse free to view. Only for 10 minutes but just breathtaking.",,
,,"Great gardens, food and light show.",4,,"I came here with my wife and father in law as he is working here for 6 months, and he told us about the gardens and how beautiful it is and it did not disappoint.

Although we haven't yet gone into the dome/enclosure with the garden, the outside is still beautiful and apparently there are the occasional otters the come ashore for a run around and play. The last time the father in law went there there were a couple that were running around his feet, but unfortunately we missed out on our visit.

Apart from the lovely gardens, there is ""stay by the bay"" which was a great local eatery with so many different choices of satay sticks, rice, noodles and may other local cuisines. Make sure you have a visit there as well as the lights at 745pm and 845pm.

There are lovely man made trees which have many plants growing up them, with a boardwalk which is linked to a tower/tree/restaurant. At 745pm/845pm they put on an amazing 15 minute light show which is a must see! If you get the early show, you can then walk through or with the crowd to the light show which is at 9pm on the other side of the marina sands hotel which I also highly recommend seeing. Just follow the crowd and they will lead the way!",,
,,Very crowded Gardens,4,,"Wonderful to see again, but it was a public holiday and incredibly crowded so a bit difficult to enjoy the lovely gardens, so cut our visit short and will try again another time. There was also a very busy activity for children that we didn't know about which meant it was extra noisy and crowded!",,
,,Casual visit with family,4,,Nice place for family gathering and 007i7iv Lmtk L Jm 5 997689799006 li iyililolih 787the garden 6kcli,,
,,A great place to visit,5,,"You don鈥檛 have to be a green thumb or garden enthusiast to visit here. The 2
domes offerings are totally different from each other and are amazing. There is a waterfall and skywalk platforms inside and they are refrigerated. Just walking in from the heat outside makes you want to be in there also. Late afternoon is the busiest but the best as you get to see it change at night if you spend a few hours there. There is a light show to music outside in the gardens which are amazing.",,
,,Lots of walking but there is a shuttle,4,,"The gardens are lovely but there is a lot of walking to be done and in the heat it can be hard work.
There is a shuttle however it only goes to the Cloud Garden and the Flower Garden.
Signage can be quite confusing so be careful.
The light show was truly amazing however where we were located we could not hear the music very well.
The light show goes for about 15minutes.
Well worth a visit.",,
,,Techno Savvy garden,5,,The Blend of Singaporean Idea to make nature part of life is reflect well in this enterprise decorated with natural vegetation . WE ENJOYED THE STROLL AT THIS GARDEN WHILE STAYING IN Marina Bay Sands Resort. The Lighting and the lasers make it a spectacular masterpiece that should not be missed in the night.,,
,,Wander the surrounding park,5,,"I left it a bit late, but still enjoyed the Cloud Forest Dome and the amazing light show.
I only paid $16 for the one Dome, missing out on the begonia display in the Flower Dome.
Light show was free and spectacular!

Then I walked the surrounding park lands, seeing well light sculptures and pathways. Locals were jogging and walking. Families strolling. Felt safe and relaxed.

I鈥檇 go a bit earlier next time. Give it 3-4 hours.",,
,,A must see ...,5,,"Do visit. There are two domes, the flower dome and the cloud forrest which was my favourite however both are amazing. Have water with you as no sellers inside the domes. There is so much to see so leave plenty of time to really appreciate the domes as well as the surrounding gardens. There is transport to get you to and from the centre as it can be a bit of a walk, but we walked as it was a beautiful day and took in all the sites. There are a few places to eat inside too.
The light show is spectacular and a lift takes you up to the skywalk, try to do this in time for the light show, it鈥檚 amazing!! If you miss getting onto the skywalk for the light show then just find a spot to lie down and look up.",,
,,Garden beyond expectation,5,,"This garden is brilliant, wasn鈥檛 expecting full air conditioning indoor garden.. haha. Quite crowded as well. Didn鈥檛 go to the cloud forest because of our time limitation, but managed to go to OCBC Skywalk.. nice view but not for the height phobia I guess.",,
,,Beautiful flowers and plants,5,,Great place to go to get out of the afternoon showers or heat! This place has some amazing flowers and plants.,,
,,Great great great!,5,,"Wow! What a spectacle! Spent two days here and it was not enough! Domes are incredible, skywalk between the Super-trees a must and the night light show at 7.45pm is spectacular. Great for young and old with activities for kids. Amenities overall are excellent. We did the audio tour which for $8 is worth it to get an overview of what鈥檚 there to then decide what areas you want to do. Lasts for 25 minutes and takes you around the entire property. Food outlets there are well priced. We ate lunch at IndoChine at the top of the Super tree which was $144 SD for three adults. Had the seafood Cambodian coconut curry, was amazing. Definitely a must see!",,
,,Impeccable.,5,,This was absolutely impeccable. On my three month trip I happened to be there when the cherry blossoms were blooming and that was incredible. Words cannot fully describe this beautiful experience.,,
,,Cloud forest dome is spectacular and can buy tickets for just one dome,5,,"Visited both domes. The cloud forest dome is totally spectacular while the flower dome is still amazing but concentrates a little more on plant varieties and education. Can buy tickets for individual domes if you don't have time for both but this isn't advertised at the ticket office. Tickets for both domes have to be used in the one day so you can't go to one dome and go back the next. The surrounding gardens are beautiful but, not surprisingly, not as lovely as the Singapore Botanic Gardens themselves. The supertrees look bet from a distance and would love to have seen them lit at night. Would be worth a trip if you have time.",,
,,EXCEPTIONNAL PLACE TO VISIT AND TO ENJOY ONCE IN SINGAPORE.,5,,"During a 8 nights stay in Singapore, sleeping 6 nights in Marina Bay Sands Hotel and 2 nights in Mandarin Oriental Hotel, I visited on several occasion Gardens of Bay. It is an incredible place, where you almost believe that you are on another planet or inside the movie Avatar... The best is really to go there by night as there will be 2 light show at around 8pm and 9pm. Do not miss them ! I will soon add some photos to my review for you to see what I'm talking about.

,,Review on Gardens by the Bay,5,,Must visit place. They have very nice Cloud forest which is of 6 floors and Gardens show in the night which should not be missed,,
,,Good free activity,4,,Was excellent to see. Could do with some seating and perhaps more people selling water. Easy to get to and from. A great hawker market nearby.,,
,,Interesting Displays - Loved the waterfall!,4,,Great experience of different flowers and plants from all continents. the highlight for me was the waterfall.,,
,,Wow factor!,5,,"A must do when in Singapore, the sheer amount of plants and the amazing architecture is just spectacular......there is a shuttle bus to cut down the walking if needed and there is also a shuttle with a tour of the gardens....easy access my train.
Plenty of eateries to choose from and a great magic faraway area for the littlest amongst other treats. All well signposted and ok for wheelchairs and oldies as they are catered for as well. Garden loves heaven and the begonia festival is on until July...beautiful. Worth paying to get into both the domes, don't miss out!",,
,,Thoroughly recommend,5,,"Spent a good couple of hours exploring the two domes and rooftop walkway.
Really enjoyed the two domes - lots of different and bright colored flowers that were a pleasure to view. The cloud dome also enabled a lovely experience walking around a jungle environment with a waterfall. Really enjoyed the exhibition on global warming - found the informative and highlighted the importance of global warming. We followed this with a the rooftop tour, which was a fun activity to do. Watch out for lots of lizards and otters roaming the place!",,
,,Worth the visit,5,,Take your time and enjoy the gardens by the bay. Amazing to see this as it is so well presented and laid out. Singapore sure know how to do tourism well. Highly recommend this place.,,
,,Beautiful,5,,Must visit when you are in Singapore. Don't miss the light show at 7.45 pm. Also do visit the cloud forest and go for OCBC skywalk.,,
,,Memories etched in heart,5,,You must visit the Gardens of the Bay if you are a lover of nature. The gardens consists of two domes and Super tree structures. The flower dome has flowers from different regions of the world. It was amazing to find all of them in one place. The walk through the cloud forest was really memorable especially during the time artificial clouds were created in the dome. You should take a note on the cloud timings to visit the dome. We narrowly missed the light and sound show held in the super trees. Overall it was worth the money spent.,,
,,My highlight of Singapore,5,,Do not miss it. We visited twice during our two day SG visit. Once in evening (to walk off dinner - felt super safe) and once during the day. The Cloud Forest is amazingly beautiful. Interesting and would suit educational aspects for kids. The Flower dome was nice if you like big flower shows. The sky walkway is breathtaking. Just loved it.,,
,,Amazing,5,,"We had heard that the Gardens by the Bay were a must see.The recommendation was correct.The Cloud Dome and the Flower dome gardens were spectacular,though very different.Our cameras were kept very busy.The scattered artworks are a nice surprise.The free garden sections are also well worth the time (and sweat) to visit.We also went down at night for the light and sound show.A feast for your eyes and ears.The music is dramatic as are the special effects lighting.Would recommend it to anyone",,
,,RELAX AND ENJOY THE GARDENS,5,,"I dropped in on my brother who lives here and he suggested we visit Gardens on the Bay which i'm glad he did.
The area is well set out. I'd suggest you arrive around 3.00pm to miss the heat of the day. We went to the cloud and flower indoor conservatories first (which are air con) then went around the outside area after it had cooled down a bit. Make sure you stay for the evening light show which was spectacular.
It can get busy with groups of people so just chill and take your time",,
,,Not SO great. Should visit if there is enough spare time.,3,,We visited the two artificial domes (flower & cloud) at the Gardens By the Bay area. To cover these two attractions and the light show (around 7 pm) in the evening one needs 1/2 day. Flower dome is better than Cloud Dome. Nothing great in Cloud Dome. And if you plan to visit National Orchid Garden then you can skip the Flower Dome too. Better to go to Gardens By the bays area just to watch the evening light show. And if you have very less time then watch the laser light show at Marina Bay Sands rather than watching the light show at the Gardens By the Bay area. Marina Bay Sands laser show is MUST WATCH !,,
,,Very worth it!,5,,I would highly recommend coming here. Great for any age. Easy to spend a few hours here. You won't see anything like it anywhere else.,,
,,special place,4,,beautful vision plants gorgeous very good at the different with the countries only downside was very crowded,,
,,A must see.,5,,"Two 15 minute light shows, set to music, each night at 7.45 & 8.45. Totally joyous and shamelessly designed to make you feel good about life. Don't miss it.",,
,,Must to see place in Singapore.,5,,"To be honest i like this place more then other s, very beautiful nature in the flowerdome. Unbeliveable hand made waterfall in clowdyforest. Price is fair enough.",,
,,Outstanding world class facility,5,,The Singapore government could teach a lot of countries on how to construct and manage a top class tourist and educational facility. I have never seen anything like this anywhere in any country I have visited. You will need 2 days and a night to really explore alkl this has to offer. Make sure you take your passport so you can get the tax refund when youn fly out,,
,,Stunning Gardens by the Bay,4,,No trip to Singapore would be complete if you don鈥檛 visit the Gardens by the Bay. Breath taking and jaw dropping. Amazing plants and gardens and super friendly staff. Highly recommended.,,
,,Holidays,4,,Nice place to visit in Singapore. Taxi is easily and fast. If one loves the Zoo. Good shelters. Pit stops around the park,,
,,Spectacular,5,,"Not only did we have an amazing view of the gardens from our room at Marina bay sands , we had the pleasure of visiting at dusk . I鈥檓 not that into plants and gardens but this is breathtaking! You definitely can鈥檛 go to Singapore without visiting. The light show at night is soooo pretty.",,
,,Interesting & unusual gardens,4,,"We enjoyed the cloud forest first before the crowds, then the flower dome which is less interesting but worth a visit. We then took the audio tour on an open 鈥榖us鈥?around the full park as it was too hot & humid to walk such a large area & we didn鈥檛 want to miss anything. All this took a few hours. We also watched the light show from our hotel at night.",,
,,Visit at night for free show,3,,"Free Garden Rhapsody show from 7.00pm to 8.45pm at Supertree grove. Wonderful, beautiful, light and sound show.",,
,,"flowers, orchards,....",5,,"flowers, orchards,... everywhere. Enough from hot city and concrete? come here to relax and breath fresh cool air in a tropical garden. Must See in SG.",,
,,Brought a group of elderlies,3,,Wheelchair friendly. However does not have many benches for resting in the indoor facilities. Was swamped with other massive organisation outing without control.,,
,,Incredible light show,4,,"There鈥檚 a children festival going on and if you have children you would enjoy it a lot, but go in the late afternoon if you want a guided tour/tram tour, as we went a little late and the tours had ended by that time, the last tour is I think 5:30 pm. There is an awesome light show starting from 7:45 but it was like 15 or 20 mins only, and it said on the information board that it will last an hour, but nevertheless it was incredible. We didn鈥檛 have time for the cloud forest and flower dome though.",,
,,Outstanding place,5,,"Amazing gardens, wheelchair friendly, easy access to all areas, great shuttle service for wheelchairs.",,
,,Spectacular light show,5,,We loved going to the Gardens by the Bay in the evening. Free entry to the area below the trees meant we were able to view the ~7.30pm light show. We also splurged and spent the $8 to go up the trees for great views over the city and the sands. We were disappointed we didn鈥檛 make it into the domes as this was also highly recommended.,,
,,A dome of nature in downtown,5,,The place is an artificial mega 2 domes of multihabitate flora in the muddle of a really organized and clean botanical garden by the bay of singapore. It is amazing jow they managed to bring nature in the muddle of an insanely modernized city state. Well done Singapore.,,
,,The most beautiful Garden ever,5,,"Normally they offer light show with classic musical at evening. Make sure to get there early to pick a good stop. I have no words to describe the beauty of this place. So, I will share photos.",,
,,Man made wonder,5,,This is a 鈥榤ust not miss it鈥?category place.. it鈥檚 a man made wonder.. had a great time with my family including my kids... clicked 100s of photos of the colourful and lovely flowers.. The man made water fall is the jewel on the crown.. Awesome...,,
,,"Amazing, futiristic experience",5,,"Never seen something similar. Really fantastic, inspiring, imagination stimulating place. Especially evening visit recommended, when each of strange, unusual ""trees"" pulsates with colored light (plus nice music surrounding). Definitely recommended!",,
,,Another must see!,5,,"Again Singapore has delivered! You gotta go and see this place, wait for the light show at night, it鈥檚 incredable. Well worth the money spent.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,Interesting buildings. Trees can be lifted when buying a ticket. The trees glow nicely at night. Gardens are rich in varied vegetation. Beautiful colored flowers :),,
,,Amazing,5,,"Didn't know what to expect but we were surprised and delight with the light show, get there early to get a seat otherwise you can sit on the floor. The view from the restaurant in the supertrees was marvellous. On our second visit, we missed the Flower Dome as it was closed for maintenance but the cloud forest was worth seeing as long as you have a head for heights.",,
,,Wow!! Amazing,4,,Very beautiful and very creative... it was looking very beautiful during night. Best to visit during night time.,,
,,Absolutely stubning,5,,Such a wonderful day out wondering around these beautiful gardens together. So well cared for and in typical Singaporean fashion there are clean toilets and water fountains and seats everywhere!,,
,,"Very, Very Cool",5,,"This is definitely a very touristy attraction but is very, very cool. There are two light shows at night, every night (7:45 and 8:45 I believe). It鈥檚 dark by 7:45 and that show was great. The music was themed with Disney greats. Definitely need to stop by and see this once! We were in the gardens but the view might be even better from a rooftop bar or the hotel itself.",,
,,A must,5,,You must do this on your trip to Singapore! If I were to come back for one day with family i'd take them to this! The views were really lovely and the trees and garden make this a really peaceful experience.,,
,,"Good , educational fun",5,,"Been here may times , always promotions going on , with something new and informative, to occupy the whole family, never lets you down for innovative subjects",,
,,Worth a visit,4,,"It was a good addition to the itinerary for family trip. All of the 4 generations ( from my grandma to my daughters) travelling together enjoyed here. Don鈥檛 miss the sound and light show at 7.45. Also
Keep extra time if going on weekend or holidays.",,
,,Out of this world!,5,,A visit to the Garden By The Bay should be in the top 鈥渢o do鈥?list of any visitor to Singapore. It鈥檚 a beautiful man made wonder. The entire atmosphere is peaceful and one can spend hours in the complex energised by the beauty of nature albeit in a man made environment. Truly a place to visit.,,
,,Excelent start to our Singapore stay,4,,"After checking in to our Hotel mid afternoon we made our way straight to the Gardens by the bay via the excellent MRT. we were not disappointed by this amazing visitor attraction.
Both Bio domes give a very dramatic view of the different scenic types of gardens from rainforest to Mediterranean.
The evening light show is something to behold and a not to be missed moment",,
,,Cool and lovely flowers inside the d貌me,5,,"Very nice view, love the flowers and cool environemnt inside the dome. A little bit pricey but its ok. Can stay there for as long as you want, sit and just relax. Althou臒h no much chairs or benches but i dont mind sitting in corners still so much to see",,
,,Just Amazing,5,,A must Visit for people who love plants and gardening in short. There are 2 conservatories. Indoor waterfall in cloud forest is worth watching,,
,,Walk In Singapore,3,,"Walked from Marina Bay Sands to the gardens and found we were in a children鈥檚 event! Gardens also surrounded by building work and not all areas accessible. Walkway and trees closed due to the possibility of lightning!
Paid to go into the two domes. The cloud dome is the best, but is very crowded but very good apart from the plastic rocks which are very poor!
Flower Dome is ok but a bit repetitive.
The walked to see the barrage and had lunch at Satay which is a Singapore Street market.
Overall ok",,
,,Beautiful,5,,The gardens are beautiful and the night show (Rapsody by the garden) is a must see. Well worth the time.,,
,,Beautiful Place,5,,I enjoyed the light show and the whole experience just to be there with all these people from all over the world enjoying the magical moment of the light show was a great feeling. I enjoy going through my pictures and remember that moment over and over.,,
,,Pure joy,5,,"We stayed at the Marine Bay Sands with a harbour view which took in the entire Gardens and what an awesome sight.
The majestic electric trees and conservatories are a joy to behold. The details of the place, from the magnifying glasses in front of the micro plants, to the cleanliness of the estate to the non smoking policy ( why promote the importance of nature and then let people pollute)
Beautiful plants, incredible insect statues to abstract structures and superb waterways and walks a great way to spend your time!
Recommended",,
,,Garden of Eden,5,,"Singapore airport makes a bold statement that this is the place for Orchids & flowers.... but the Gardens by the Bay, takes it to the highest level.

These is the free areas that you can thoroughly enjoy and a few paid areas too. The Magical Tree area with children themed areas it beautiful and if you would like to do the Skywalk 22 meters above ground, you will add another dimension to the view.

A must visit",,
,,Fascinating,5,,Make sure to witness the light show. The indoor exhibits provide a respite from the heat. After the light show have your return planned out can be a long wait for a taxi.,,
,,"Definitely worth a visit, particularly if you appreciate wonderful flora!",4,,"This is a beautifully developed area, containing exquisite plants and exotic flowers, with various pieces of interesting sculpture dotted around the gardens - dragon, eagle, etc., and a tree walk. There's also a special area for children where they can play under ""dancing fountains"", Would recommend you also go into the special greenhouses, for which there is an entry charge. Watching the otters playing in the lake was enchanting. In the evenings there is a stunning ""light display"" when 12 huge ""trees"" are illuminated with lights that are co-ordinated to dance to a particular music theme - on the night of our visit it was waltzes. A truly memorable experience.",,
,,A cool spot in sweltering Singapore,5,,"Tired of the oppressive heat we went to the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. The beauty of the flower dome was outstanding, and the cloud forest very interesting. We had toured the botanic gardens earlier in the day so we really enjoyed these climate controlled attractions.",,
,,Beautiful farden,4,,I visited this garden with my family and was amazed to see the wide variety of plants and flowers on display. The domes are must do for anyone visiting this garden. Would recommend it to all visiting Singapore,,
,,Light show is amazing but entrance to the conservatories isn't worth it.,3,,"We had wanted to view the light show, so decided to arrive 2 hours early and use our City Sightseeing pass to go into the Conservatories (Cloud Forest and Flower Conservatory).

The conservatories weren't worth the money or the time.

We went into the Cloud Forest first, waiting 30 minutes to go inside (which we thought was a pretty good waiting time), only to find that when we got inside there was another hour and a half wait to go in the lift to the walkways. We would have missed the light show if we had waiting in line, so decided to just walk around the 'ground floor' which took a grand total of 7 minutes.

We then went into the Flower Conservatory which was fine, but the displays were being changed so most of the flowers/hanging baskets were just on the floor (yet we still paid full price!). Especially not worth it if you're English because you'll find most of the flowers in your garden (minus a palm tree or two).

Regardless, the light show was absolutely stunning and we would absolutely watch this again.

In short, save your money and just watch the free light show.",,
,,Love the atmosphere,5,,Cool and chilling...love the atmosphere! Do visit the cafe in the flower dome. Lots of species flowers and plant. Love the cloud dome too! Fresh breeze air like never before.,,
,,Amazing Gardens with Beautiful Architecture,5,,"Gardens By The Bay is a must see on every tourists list that why it鈥檚 always busy very easily accessible by Mrt Bay Front Station. The gardens have many attractions the Cloud Forest, the Flower dome, the Supertree Grove and the Children鈥檚 Garden which is a must visit if your traveling with children they have an amazing water play area and it鈥檚 free. We spent an entire day at the gardens there just so much to see and enjoy absolutely lovely.",,
,,Fabulous place to spend a couple of hours,4,,Just be careful when planning what day to visit as each site closes periodically for maintenance. Wonderful place to while away a couple of hours.,,
,,Breath Taking,4,,Simply Breath taking and Amazing Ambience to visit. You can in evening for the laser show it's just Amazing thing to witness.,,
,,Beautiful gardens set up,4,,"Definitely a Singaporean attraction suitable for all ages.Unfortunately couldn't do the treetop walk, if you want to do it go before 8 PM. Accessible also by MRT or taxi, but quite crowded.Very well maintained you can lose track of time just wondering through the 2 domes. If you want to see the light show, it starts around 7:45 PM and it's free...it is unique and beautiful, but could never match real nature. Hopefully we take care of our natural environment so that our future generations don't see only artificial waterfalls and flowers",,
,,"So discouraged, I hope our future is not too much like this",3,,"I was asking myself what if one day this type of garden the only kind of 鈥渘ature 鈥渙ur children know. More and more people seem to have smart ways to justify it. They may say, this is important for environment, for knowledge, for humanity etc. Humongous Air-conditioned to support so these plants alive! I do not really know.
Giant roof of glass, fake water falls, either for our knowledge or more for photo opportunities, I doubt if I will take my children to this 鈥済ardens鈥? I cannot speak for others, even I had disagreement with my wife on this subject. I hope people will build less this kind of 鈥榓musement park鈥? I personally hope there will be less faking nature acts in future and the real cost of this will not be billed to future generation.",,
,,Just amazing,5,,Our second visit as the cloud forest was closed for improvement work during our first visit. Very good value & you can easily spend 2-3 hours here visiting the flower dome & cloud forest. Good value fast food is on site as well as the usual super clean toilets & baby change facilities & super tree grove is excellent. A must see in Singapore.,,
,,Fabrastic,5,,All I can say is the night light show is spectacular and a must see. The music is amazing. Lot of walking though as there is a great deal to see .,,
,,Beautiful park,5,,"Beautiful park on the water. Nice walking paths and super trees (you can go up inside one and take the sky walk) I would have liked to spend more time but it was too hot. The two huge enclosed gardens are air conditioned and were not only beautiful, but also a cool escape from the heat.",,
,,Singapore Gem,5,,"Gardens by the Bay was on our list of must do's and didn't disappoint. Beautifully designed and maintained, it's easy to navigate with lots to see and do. For the next few weeks there is an Enid Blyton 'The Enchanted Wood' theme which is just magical. We arrived by taxi but it's right by an MRT station and linked to Marina Bay Sands by a walk bridge. There is a special offer on to buy an annual fAmily pass for $90 which we bought yesterday and already used its full value so any return trips are free. So much to see and do. Our children !oved it! We haven't been at night yet, or done the treetop walk, but I've watched the light show from my hotel window and it looked spectacular - beautifully framed by the Singapore Flyer that I also have an amazing view of. We'll visit the indoor domes on a rainy day but for now I'm blown away be his amazing this attraction is.",,
,,Beautiful Light Show,5,,This is a must see in Singapore. I like the lighting so much but too crowded. The show takes place at 1945 and 2045 on daily basis.,,
,,Cool place to visit,5,,"Visited twice already and equally impressed with the place. In hot and humid Singapore, it is such a pleasant experience to be able to visit a beautiful garden setup in a really cooling environment. It is even more impressive that there are no insects flying around to disturb your experience! It is like ... perfect!(except there is the crowd ... lol)

The 2 conservatory, Cloud forest and Flower dome is really a must-do if you visit Singapore. Each has it's own attractive charm. Cloud forest give one a feeling of being in an adventure especially when they start ""misting"" the whole place.

The skywalk is nice too, though I must agree it is a bit expensive. The garden outside and super tree areas are free to visit, however it get warm and you start to miss the climate controlled conservatories. LOL.

I have not visit in the evening yet, I heard the light up is very beautiful as well ... will do it soon.",,
,,Place for all Ages!!!,4,,A beautiful place to visit for all ages. You can visit the flower and cloud dome which is priced reasonably & very beautiful.. Also ensure you visit the light show around 7.45 pm. A must visit for all,,
,,Plant Lovers Delight,5,,A great place to spend at least half a day touring the two domes. Go PM and stay to watch the light show in the evening. Great even if you just want to wander about the gardens for an hour,,
,,Beautiful gardens very well set up,5,,"Although the weather was a bit threatening we decided to visit the Gardens and we are glad we did. The cloud dome is magnificent and really was the highlight. We found the flower dome not quite as stunning, but it is still pretty incredible! The remainder of the gardens are beautifully maintained and the amenities are great with toilets, seats and refreshment options well placed. It is well worth the entrance fee.",,
,,Only visited on a night,4,,"Went here to watch the show on a night and although I enjoyed walking round and seeing the lights and music it was a bit boring, not really my cup of tea. Different though and unique and a nice place to spend a night",,

The flower dome/cloud forest is ideal for visit in the middle of the day, when its too hot outside, and the garden and supertree grove in the afternoon and evening. Dont skip the supertree lightshow at evening(its in every hour).",,
,,Excellent man made Natural environment.,5,,"Excellent man made Natural environment. Both Cloud forest and flower garden were amazing. At one place we different countries/locations Plants, flower etc. A different experience in Cloud forest. Night light show was amazing. try to reach by 3.30 PM firstly enjoy inside attractions and in the evening around 7.30-7-45 PM enjoy Light show of super glow trees.",,
,,Well Worth a Visit...,4,,"Fascinating construction & great collection of flora inside the dome. The elevated walkways give you fantastic views inside the dome. The waterfall dominates the visit, but so much else to view & learn from, too",,
,,Cool Height Gardens by the Bay,5,,"We had just descended from Marina Bay Sands and drive to garden
It looked like a simple big one until we saw huge concrete structure with fauna and also a very grand suspended observation way that we managed to reach by a lift
What a scene once we reached there
Not only we can see the hotel plus flower dome and cloud forest dome we also see tiny mushroom gardens and a sprawling huge lawn
During the evening and night too they look superb",,
,,Supertree Grove,5,,"Huge park, but we spent our time at the Supertree Grove. Get there early to enjoy the light show at 7:45 PM or 8:45 PM. It was beautiful. The only issue is the taxi line after the show ends. So maybe duck out a few minutes early if you're planning on getting a taxi home or back to your hotel.",,
,,mr,5,,Beautiful make sure to visit the light show at night close to many attractions within walking distance. Eateries and facilities catered for,,
,,Awesome!,5,,This is a still a relatively new attraction & proving very popular. It鈥檚 an easy walk from the Marina. We chose not to pay to go into the glass houses but loved just wandering. It鈥檚 huge & certainly would warrant further visits! The immense metal tree structures are fantastic. It certainly brings the garden into the city!!,,
,,Fabulous gardens,5,,"Such a lot to see. Take the tram ride around when you arrive as this is an interesting and inexpensive tour.

鈥淭he Cloud鈥?is a wonderful indoor garden experience, especially the beautiful waterfall as you enter the building. The Sky Walk is a must for those who do not mind heights. All the plants, trees and shrubs are beautiful and so well kept.

鈥淭he Flower鈥?dome was exquisite. So many different flowers and trees from all over the world.

Sadly that was all we had time to see but would love to go back there one day.",,
,,Very good experience,5,,It and awesome experience for kids cloud forest with man made waterfall and different species of plants and tress as well as flower dome where you get to see all kind of flower from whole world most beautiful was white tulip my kids really enjoyed the visit,,
,,Fascinating Gardens,5,,"The gardens were nicely maintained and organized. The garden maintained at the top floor of flower dome and the at the lowest floor are extraordinary. Should straight take elevator to reach the sixth floor and walk on the top floor and then move down.
The cloud forest is equally mesmerizing. So is the walk on the skyway. The light and sound show was also excellent.",,
,,Wonderful experience for young families,4,,A great place for children and an enjoyable experience for adults especially for keen gardeners. The view from the Skywalk looking out over all the gardens provided a completely different aspect which was amazing! The music combined with the light show was very special.,,
,,Great place,4,,"Absolutely beautiful gardens, so many differen plants and flowers. Spent over 3 hrs wandering around the beautiful, peaceful, clean gardens. A must if you're visiting Singapore",,
,,Amazing Place,5,,We visited this Place last September and totally were blown away by how beautiful this garden was. We will definitely be back and spend more time here.,,
,,The light up is very entertaining to the eyes,3,,"We went here for a side trip after a long day seminar but we were able to catch up with the forest cloud which is so amazing. They organize flowers vertically. The mist, the stones, the secret garden was just Amazing. We don't have time to see the Flower Dome for the time being but was able to catch up the lighting at the Supertree Grove that was so magical! Everything was just so worth to our uncomfortable sweating because of the humidity. I will definitely come back again!",,
,,A must!,5,,"An incredibile place 卯n Singapore and 卯n the world! Very nice, especially 卯n the evenings, it's a must when you are 卯n Singapore.",,
,,Amazing!,5,,"Could spend a week here; only had a day. Missed the night show, wished we鈥檇 had time to stick around! Very much worth the money and time. Very interesting.",,
,,Beautiful place,4,,"This is well worth a visit! Huge amount of different species of plants and animals, overall a fantastic atmosphere, and never seems too crowded, even on busy days.",,
,,Best,5,,A must see if you come to Singapore. Truly amazing and well set out. Wouldn't have missed it. Can be weather dependent. The walk bridge is a must. Very children friendly.,,
,,Relaxing Walk,5,,Nice to get away from the hustle and the bustle and enjoy beautiful gardens in a very quiet peaceful setting. Amazing fauna and flora to see. Good strolls and a sweet coffee shop at the end.,,
,,Garden by the Bay,4,,Nice place to see exhibit of plants and flowers. Can get cheaper discount from online booking. Nice rainforest and flowers garden. Night lights and musical performance at Super Groove Tree garden,,
,,Children鈥檚 Garden is the best!,5,,"We love to go to the Children鈥檚 Garden, with fantastic playground & huge waterplay there! Just watch out your kids, coz my son went to the playground behind the waterplay and we couldn鈥檛 find him.. other than that, the trip was great. 馃憤馃徎",,
,,Amazing Light Show,5,,Such a beautiful light show! Well worth the time and there are great food places as well. The satay was amazing!,,
,,Very big & Impressive!,4,,It's nice to see how they made this super garden! The Super Tree Grove is really awesome. Crazy to see. It's nice that you don't have to pay entrance just to be at the gardens.,,
,,Nice way to spend the day,5,,Great gardens and tours in each of the 3 domes. Walking the path outside was also very nice. Beautiful views across the bay. I recommend a drink atop one of the structures in the Gardens. Spectacular views of Singapore.,,
,,Flower dome is a must-see,5,,"Sakura festival was going on, I鈥檝e also seen the Tulip and Halloween festivals. It not only makes for great photo ops but is a fun family event",,
,,Singapore vacation 2018,5,,"For us it was new attraction, and we are really enjoy. two different places to see, they collect so many flora, it is amazing hard job and they did it. inside of one of building you can find highest inside waterfall in the world and you can walk by clouds. we loved that at the end of exhibition you can find some information how to safe of our planet. this is amazing project!",,
,,Lovely gardens. Tree structures and the light show fantastic,5,,"We loved this area - we took the tourist tram around which was very suitable for my elderly mother, hardly any walking required and the taxi drops nearby. Coffee at Pollen terrace was good, and the conservatory Gardens were lovely. The standout though are the amazing tree structures and the light show in the evenings quite magical.",,
,,A must visit,5,,What a spectacular show with laser lights at night... Both the domes were beautifully created with plants and flowers of different countries and adapting to their temperate climates...,,
,,A must see in Singapore !,5,,"wow worth worth a visit, so beautiful especially the cloud forest with the waterfall!! Must take water with you as a long walk round.",,
,,Family Holiday,5,,Enjoyed a lot at the garden specially the light show in the night and the audio trip explaining each and every corner of the garden,,
,,Visit to Gardens by the Bay,5,,"Beautiful, we went to the flower dome first, then the rain forest. The temperature inside is very ""brisk"", you might want to take a sweater for inside. But worth the trip and the metal trees around the area are cool. Unfortunately we were unable to see it last night, we were told that the lights are great, next time",,
,,Great place,5,,Very interesting and beautiful. Had a children's festival. The domes are great and you can learn a lot.,,
,,"Excellent , but be ready to walk",5,,"An excellent garden, well presented and maintained.They have 2 domes, worth watching and whole place is airconditioned",,
,,Best attraction In Singapore,5,,If you have time for only one attraction in Singapore do not miss Gardens by the Bay. It is an amazing experience with so many new features since our last visit five years ago. The tropical plants and waterfall in the Cloud Forest are spectacular and the air cool and refreshing inside the structure. There is a lift to the top for people who are unable to walk up. Views to the City and over the bay are worth capturing on camera. The gift shop is well stocked with attractive souvenirs. We missed the light show but will try to get there next time.,,
,,A must do if in Singapore.,5,,"My wife and I were amazed at this tourist gardens domes. There are 2. I did prefer the Cloud Forest one, with the waterfall and access to the top of the dome. All airconditioned to a cool climate for the plants. Wonderful experience and fantastic place for photos.",,
,,Great morning at the gardens,4,,We had a great time with our 3&5 yr old. We took the MRT from Orchard and that took us with only a small nice walk over the bridge into the gardens. We went to the Cloud Forest which was excellent. The kids loved the waterfall and the canopy walk. the vegetation and woodcraft is marvellous. Much of the kids festival was closed due to rain (although it had stopped raining at least for an hour). Wash rooms OK but not very clean.,,
,,Dont miss!,5,,"It was the tulip display at the gardens when we visited, this was our second visit having visited about 2-3yrs ago and our first visit for our friend travelling with us. We absolutely loved it as much as the first time, its easy to just sit in the cool and admire all the flowers, we had a local who is a regular visitor to the gardens sit down and chat to us which made our visit more enjoyable. It's a feast for the eyes.",,
,,Beautiful park with multiple things to do,5,,"We spent the better part of a day inside GBTB. The two conservatories are extremely well maintained, and a sight to sore urban eyes. The water fountains and nearby park for kids is so much fun - my child loved it. The light show is the topping. We saw the show from the skyway - amazing is the only word! Don't miss it at all! A definite must-do attraction!",,
,,Experience of a lifetime,5,,What a magnificent ecopark in the middle of a bustling city A memorable experience with much to see and learn,,
,,Amazing... the detail was an eye opener.,5,,"For myself who isn鈥檛 a big flower or plant kinda girl, this was sensational. The effort and detail placed into this whole experience is amazing. My partner and kids were in awe.",,
,,Mesmerizing Light Show,5,,"I spent an early evening here waiting for the light show. I walked around all of the gardens, exploring, and getting slightly lost (in a good way). I did not go to the inside exhibits because the lines were very long. I would definitely suggest not going in the middle of the day if you can't stand the heat!

I found an excellent, kind of hidden spot to sit and wait for the light show. There is an area of rocks near the World of Palms that overlooks the Supertree Grove. This was an awesome vantage point to see the light show without the crowds. It also gave you an elevated place to sit and watch. The best part is that it's all free!

Definitely don't miss this show during your time in Singapore! This one of my favorite travel experiences ever. I loved it.",,
,,"Great value, not too busy, great shops",5,,"I went on a Sunday morning when it opened - it opens earlier than a lot of things in Singapore. I did the high walk which I would recommend and both the ""greenhouses"". The grounds and parks are nice to walk around. I really liked the range of good on sale which were reasonably prices. It was immaculate as is Singapore generally - I walked back via the Bay Hotel and back into town.",,
,,Stunning - and airconditioned!,5,,"Just beautiful, even if you're not a garden guru. Something to look at, at every turn. Magnificent waterfalls. A bit contrived. Multi level boardwalks. Right next to Marina Bay sands. Take a shuttle car to get there, once you've walked behind Marina Bay Sands, its right there.",,
,,Excellent place,5,,Went with family very good place to see looks like a new wonder made by Singaporeans must visit place,,
,,Unbelievable marvel,5,,"This place is a must visit whether you are in town for pleasure or a short business trip. Recreating nature in the most spectacular way. Also air conditioned , so great if you want to escape the humidity outside. Must see!",,
,,Awe-inspiring,5,,"This attraction is undoubtedly an iconic landmark in Singapore. I am sure every Singaporean will boast about it. It is located in the prime locality of Marina Bay. It is spread over acres of land and has man-made tree structures that light up in the evening and look beautiful. As we entered the premises we saw a nice pond with people taking a walk around it. It is absolutely free to visit the attraction with the exception of Cloud Forest and Flower Dome which are paid attractions. We bought deals from Groupon Singapore for the same. Flower Dome is an indoor dome type structure with numerous species of flowers, probably imported from around the world. Cloud Forest is a sincere effort to replicate a forest and it鈥檚 fascinating to see something of this scale in the middle of the city. The entrance makes way for an artificial waterfall which indeed is refreshing. I would definitely recommend anyone a visit to this place. It would be worth paying for the two paid attractions as well. My opinion! Thanks.",,
,,"Cloud forest, an ethereal experience",5,,"Visit to Gardens by the bay was easily the highlight of my Singapore trip with family. Gardens by the bay is a memory that lingers, especially the Cloud forest. It has the world's highest indoor waterfall with artificial mist. Altogether a memorable experience. Would love to go back",,
,,Take the audio tour if you鈥檙e short on time,5,,"Take the audio tour which lasts about 30min if you鈥檙e short on time. Otherwise, I wouldn鈥檛 mind spending the day there. Do bring hat/umbrella and water and prepare to walk a lot.",,
,,Amazing - must see attraction,5,,A holiday highlight and a must see if going to Singapore. The gardens are amazing - they open at 9am so arrive early to beat the rush. Go on the skywalk and visit all the domes.A must see is the evening light show at 8.45 pm - unbelievable and it is free - just went on and on - would have happily paid to see it was that good.,,
,,Nice experience,4,,Great place both the domes have unique flowers from all over the world. Musical show is must watch it's free to all,,
,,Disappointed,3,,"We arrived at 7:30pm, so could only enter 1 dome. On advice we went to cloud forest, tbh, people had said it was so amazing etc, but we thought it was a bit over rated for 16 s$ each.I liked the outside 鈥?light up鈥?trees that are free and the walks ways etc. It was just the cloud dome, wasn鈥檛 as good as we expected,there were more artificial things inside than we thought there would be.I felt it was a bit of an educational place, rather than a tourist attraction, so that鈥檚 why only the 3 *, as I鈥檓 a visitor.",,
,,Amazing experience,5,,It鈥檚 to be seen to be believed. Really wonderful to see the variety of flora and flowers from around the world habitats. Again do visitor friendly. Don鈥檛 forget to consider using the audio-visual guides available on rent at the Visitor facility center.,,
,,Awesome,5,,"Rainforest and Flower are wonderful and worth visit with family n kids. Go in the evening and take OCBC skywalk and enjoy the evening show, it鈥檚 stunning.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,Must do for everyone..must do late afternoon to see lights in the gardens and walk to see Marina Bay lights,,
,,Stunning,5,,"What a place, absolutely something out of the box with an indoor waterfall, extensive plant range from every country, and something for everyone. I would recommend taking the bus around the garden before deciding what you want to see. This garden is huge and the weather is humid so it can be exhausting.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,We went into both domes and were blown away by the beautiful flowers and plants. It is a sight to behold. So so beautiful.,,
,,Very nice to know,4,,One of the most beautiful places in the world. You should get involved with the culture of this place to understand their vision of the world.,,
,,Beautiful Gardens,4,,"This is a must if travelling to Singapore. There are two separate domes and both are truly beautiful. I absolutely loved the cloud garden with a spectacular view over the city and stunning display of gardens. The flower garden is beautiful and I loved that it was broken up into themed gardens. Definitely worth the money. If you stay for the evening light show nearby, well that's a bonus!",,
,,Arrive 15 min. before it opens!,5,,"Yes! It is a place to remember. For an orchid grower like me it was paradise.

We've been there on Saturday. We had a long connection flight so we went to see the gardens. We arrived at 7 AM and traveled the beautiful grounds around. After 9 AM it was too hot to travel under the Singapore sun.

We were the first tourists who entered the glasshouse and it was such a calm and relaxing experience. There's so much to see there - walk slowly and don't forget to smell the orchids! After lunch we went there again, mostly for escaping the unbearable heat, and it was SO CROWDED and loud.

I highly recommend you to be the first tourists who enter to this magnificent place. I think the opening hour is 09:00 AM. We didn't book our tickets in advance, and on 08:45 there was a short queue.",,
,,A Little Oasis in the Big City,3,,"It's next to the Marina Bay hotel, so we wandered over, found it nice and relaxing, decided to go into the Cloud Forest Dome. It was OK. Wanted to come back at night and go up to the Super Tree Grove. The bar and restaurant opens until midnight. That would be a good way to see the city lights, but we never made it. Next time.",,
,,Remarkable,5,,"I have to hand it to Singapore for making this a true destination to come to . The Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are must see destinations. There was a tulip exhibit when we were there and it was amazing. The Cloud Forest was also remarkable and going up beyond the falls was really interesting. It also was educational and made you understand the problems forests face these days and the dwindling forest cover around the world .
One cannot but be amazed at the effort to build these two attractions and plant all of these trees , plants and flowers . The Gardens management are to be commended for running the whole place efficiently. A must see destination in Singapore",,
,,Very nice,3,,I guess if you are a keen gardener or really interested in flora and fauna then this is the place to go. Otherwise its ok worth an hour or two to walk around. Would love to have seen it at night but no time. Also they closed the skywalk because of rain so would have liked to have tried that too.,,
,,A Unique Experience,5,,A must see location in Singapore. The gardens offer a wise variety of plants from all around the world to view along with educational exhibits about biodiversity and conservation. The photo opportunities are great as well.,,
,,Amazing,5,,This place is well worth a visit on a night as it is all lit up and beautiful. There is also a bar there with very good views.,,
,,Great Value,5,,"It is a great way to spend a day.
The actual Gardens are free but the Domes have a reasonable fee attached but well worth seeing.
The Tree Top Walk also has an entry fee, these is also well worth doing.
At certain time of the years they have special displays in the Domes and in the Gardens.
There are places to eat and drink and plenty of places to sit and people watch.",,
,,Great day out,5,,We took our children (3 and 1) along to the gardens and they absolutely loved it. Definitely make sure you go into the flower cloud gardens well worth it. Easily accessible via the MRT from Bayfront. Plenty of choices for food so spend the whole day of you can.,,
,,beautiful gardens,5,,"Beautiful gardens, well maintained, loads to see and do, great for kids. The domes were worth a visit although it costs money to get in here they are worth spending a few hours exploring.",,
,,Definitely get tickets online,5,,"the queues on-site are huge, so thoroughly recommend pre-purchasing and just collecting on arrival!! Totally worth the trip and a must do while in Singapore",,
,,Meh.,3,,"This is THE selfie taking attraction. We were a bit annoyed walking around. I wouldn't come here if you don't LOVE plants. We don't, but we thought ""we HAVE to see this."" Well, it didn't make us like it more. Plants are plants even if...More",,
,,one of the wonders of the modern world,5,,stunning place. You wonder the whole time...how did they accomplish this?! a great place to spend many hours in comfort out of the heat.,,
,,Short stay,5,,Beautiful displays of flowers and plants dominated by a high waterfall. Easy access with lifts if you are unable to use walkways. Plenty to see all under a glass roof.,,
,,Beautiful Gardens,5,,"The gardens are simply stunning, a must do while in Singapore We were lucky enough to enjoy some of the entertainment celebrating Chinese new year which were fantastic A beautiful way to spend an afternoon with the glory of the Singapore skyline never far away",,
,,"Very pretty, Public park",4,,"Don't be mislead you can walk down to this Public park it has nice exhibits, but then you have to pay for them, the evening light show is worth watching, and the satay area restaurants near the barrage are fantastic value,",,
,,Captivating lights show,5,,"Try to go in the late afternoon in order to walk around while there is still light but stay for the light show once the sun has set, as it鈥檚 well worth it!",,
,,A must visit,4,,It was peace to the eye.. the cloud forest is super good. A treat to the eye in the hot weather. Flower dome is also pretty but ok experience. The cloud forest鈥檚 waterfalls and mountain walks were amaxing.,,
,,Awesome,5,,We visited Gardner鈥檚 of the bay and went in our first driverless vehicle which took us to the domes. We went to both domes but the cloud forrest was much better than the flower dome but it just depends entirely what you like. We watched...More,,
,,Spectacular!,5,,A must-see! I have to experience it myself to prove that it鈥檚 indeed the best garden in the world. It鈥檚 temperature cool in the cloud forest dome. The man made falls was awesome. The hanging walk ways were astonishing in every step. Worth the entrance...More,,
,,Very pleasant and enjoyable,5,,"I have visited these gardens twice now. I particularly like the cloud dome which has several storeys of rain forest. The interior climate is so very pleasant and enjoyable, and it is also great to enjoy the orchids and many varieties of plants. The gardens are set in beautiful parklands with great views of the city.",,
,,Fascinating,5,,"This place is simply fascinating, right from the architecture to the people, the place, the atmosphere. One cannot go wrong visiting here.",,
,,Beautiful area,4,,We enjoyed our walk through these gardens - there is a shuttle to save on walking but we didn't use it. Some spots have an additional fee but there is plenty to see for free. The transit system has a stop right there.,,
,,Incredible!,5,,"These gardens are incredible and feature plants from all over the world. Not to be missed are the Supertrees and the bio-domes. We enjoyed Gardens by the Bay during the day, but at night they were even more spectacular with the light show in the glen of the Supertrees. Utterly amazing!

This is a must-see if you're in Singapore!",,
,,"Spent the entire day here, Amazing place!",5,,"This was by far the best place in Singapore that we have been to
Although the weather was extremely hot and sticky we had water and were suitably dressed. We visited during the week so the crowds were good and it was easy to walk through.",,
,,Must visit when in Singapore,5,,The most amazing garden have ever been to . I did the the Tree top walk which was amazing . Dont miss the cloud dome. fascinating location and great place. Nice to walk around.,,
,,Loved it 馃憤,5,,We did this as an organised tour. Loved the two domes but the cloud forest was defo my favourite. Included in our tour was vouchers towards a meal (nothing special) and the a ticket to the Sky Park at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel; OMG that part was amazing. The views are absolutely amazing... go do it you won鈥檛 be disappointed.,,
,,Amazing exhibitions of plants in fabulous surroundings,5,,"The plant exhibition in the dome was asolutely fabulous with lots of amazing sculptures and imaginative planting. I was absolutely bowled over by the beauty, detail and love put into the place. The only downside was a lot of the restaurants on the site close at 3 pm.",,
,,Amazing,4,,It鈥檚 incredible how they have built this place and how much effort has gone in to make it so beautiful. It鈥檚 a must if you鈥檙e in Singapore. Also if you鈥檙e staying in marina bay sands then book the garden room suite for incredible views of gardens by the bay.,,
,,Futuristic Trees set in large open park like setting,4,,Worth a trip - walk around and visit the exhibits. When I was there they had a tulip show - not that impressive - looked a bit trampled on but it was nice and cool inside. To walk above the trees you need to buy a ticket. I suggest going at night when everything is lit up.,,
,,Absolutely amazing,5,,"This was one of my favourite things we did here in Singapore and when we go back it is first on my list to go back to.

We were a couple but this place is great for groups and families everyone really and there is a wonderful atmosphere there!",,
,,Tulip Festival,5,,I was so glad I took the time for this place. It was beautiful. The garden was so tastefully arranged.,,
,,Well worth the visit!,5,,These gardens were better than we thought they would be. The Cloud Dome and The Flower Dome were both amazing. Eateries are available in the park.,,
,,Astonishing work of engineering,5,,"We found this a marvelous place to visit, totally worth the price of entrance into the Domes. The Cloud Atlas dome was an educational experience, especially the beautiful waterfall. We were lucky to have caught the beautiful Tulip festival at the flower dome. Totally worth the price of admission.
The outdoor park was beautiful as well. It was just a shame we couldn't get on the Skywalk as it was raining.
Another must if visiting Singapore.",,
,,"Nice gardens, worth a visit",4,,"Nice gardens, landmark of Singapore so worth a visit. It鈥檚 a nice walk around but be aware of the Singapore heat! There鈥檚 water stations and bathrooms around so you can easily spend a few hours here and is easily accessible via the MTR. I visited during December and there were some lovely Christmas lights around and special events held, there was an entry to the special Christmas sections. Worth a visit if you have time.",,
,,Amazing,5,,Gardens by the Bay are the most amazing gardens we have ever been to. The outside gardens are wonderful to wander through. We did the tree top walk which shows the vastness of the park. We visited both domes. The variety of plants in the Flower Dome is extensive. They had an incredible Tulip display in the middle and feature plants from many different countries. The Cloud Dome has a huge waterfall at the start and you wind your way up to the top. There many interesting displays along the way.,,
,,Absolutely a work of art,5,,"Be sure to allow yourself a whole day or 2 even.
We started our visit on the guided tour bus to get an overall picture of which gardens we wanted to take a closer look at with our limited time. Be sure to visit both domes and allow at least 2 hours per dome.
Unfortunately due to bad weather we missed the tree top walk but I look forward to doing it and having dinner up in the tree next visit.
Very fairly priced for a whole day visit.",,
,,Feels like heaven!!,5,,Gardens by the bay is the most beautiful place in the world. I fell in love with the flower dome I literally started crying seeing the flowers...it feels like heaven. Very family friendly as well as very educational.,,
,,During weekdays are less clouded...,4,,"This place is located near Marina Bay Sands but need to walk without roof for 10 mins (even from the closest 鈥楤ay Front鈥?MRT station (Circle line, yellow) takes also 10 mins walk)...
There is a small shuttle bus near outside of the MRT station but you still need to pay.
For entrance ticket I recommend to book online in advance so that you do not have to be long queue (if you know any local friends or any friends who are living in Singapore, they can get slightly discounted tickets online.) and you just need to show your ticket on mobile.
Cloud Forest is the most interesting place to visit if you like to chill out from hot and humid weather.
Flower dome you can take a lot of photos of tree and flowers (they sometimes organise seasonable events) but just too many people and everywhere especially weekends.
If you don鈥檛 want to see less people better to visit during weekdays.",,
,,Do not miss this great attraction,5,,"Ny husband and I visited Gardens by the Bay on a very hot day. We started at the flower dome and spent ages looking at the plants and flowers not only from Singapore but all around the world. Abosolutely a mind blower, amazing displays, tendered to perfection. Next was the Cloud walk. What a great piece of consruction this is. Also educational with a display on global warming and the way it is affecting all our lives We went to the super trees light and sound show at night. Hard to describe. See it for yourself. Brilliant, amazing, gorgeous. How we miss this great Singapore piece of magic. Well done. If you come away from Singapore without seeing Gardens by the Bay, you have missed a slice of heaven on earth.",,
,,Ok place,5,,The place is good with artificial and beautiful trees and light show looks very good at night beautiful,,
,,Superb!,5,,"Don't miss the Cloud Dome!! Apart from being a welcome resp[ite from the heat, it is a fascinating location filled with so much information - great for kids too!",,
,,Wow! A must do in Singapore.,5,,"Whilst you think you are visiting a place to look at some flowers and plants, you have to expand your expectations significantly. We spent over 4 hours in a place we would have thought 2 - 3 was enough. Even 4 was just adequate. The only thing stopping us staying longer was our reduced energy levels. There is so much to see both inside and out and please do spent time outside, even though it may be very hot. There are some amazing plants and very good information signs. Do the outside first then go inside to cool off. You don't need to do the tree walk as the Cloud has a great one included. Lovely restaurant inside the Flower Dome. Not too expensive (by Singapore standards).",,
,,Magical!,5,,"we spent a whole day at garden by the bay. day time its looks so beautiful and night time the place is looks so magical because of the light show .It takes a while to get around the gardens (especially in the heat),",,
,,Magical,5,,"Absolutely magical. This attraction is a must see when in Singapore and make sure you see the light show at night, it was fantastic. Both the Cloud Forrest and Flower Dome are wonderful....though my absolute favourite out of the two was the Cloud Forrest.",,
,,Not to be missed鈥拣煈嶐煆?5.0,,"This garden is very beautiful鈥?Suggest to visit it at night for the beautiful lightings on each Supertrees within this garden

Not to be missed鈥?Highly recommended by me to enjoy an approximately 1鈨?鈨ins show named ~ The Garden Rhapsody Light Show ~ 鉁ㄢ瓙

It鈥檚 definitely worth your time 鈱?for a unique, colourful & beautiful lightings movement according to the rhythm of the installed music

It was with Star 猸?Wars theme during my recent visit, do enjoy a video clip captured & her travel blogging 鈥? blog link at profile 鈽猴笍",,,
,,Amazingly different,5,,"These gardens are a 'one off' in the world. Absolutely amazing! And when looking into the history of the gardens discovering how electricity is produced for the gardens and cooling of the domes, along with a myriad of ideas implemented to handle plants from all types of temperature zones, you cannot help but be impressed. The gardens and 'trees' are outstanding, but the domes add another element with a huge variety of plants on different levels. We visited when the tulip display was on - what a great sight! The gardens are a very worthwhile experience, taking 'as long as is needed' - could be easily a full day wandering around and staying for the light show at night.",,
,,A must for the light show,5,,"So much to see, if you have young children there is a great children鈥檚 area with water fountains, so take a towel. The evening light show is amazing and really geared to kids with popular music, which is enough to mesmerise the most hardened souls.
A good hawker centre, a little more expensive than those in the city, but a lovely walk along the front, great satay and stir fry.
And of course the best photo shots of the marina bay sands.",,
,,Fantastic,5,,"A must see - do not miss the evening light shows. It takes a while to get around the gardens (especially in the heat), but it is so worth the effort.",,
,,Must see,5,,Very impressive and a must see for both young and old. Schedule plenty of time to look around and don鈥檛 forget to bring your camera.,,
,,Brilliant place,5,,This is an amazing experience recommend for everyone. There is nothing like this that I know at least on this side of the world.,,
,,Great attraction and you'll get to see something different,5,,"The place is an architectural marvel itself. Once you go there, you have 3 different attractions to choose from. Going to the Supertree grove last would be best, especially at 745, when they have a light show there.",,
,,Impressive gardens,5,,"Absolutely impressive gardens, I mean you will definitely not be disappointing, it is well worth the visit, great landscapes from the top, you have such good shots to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, the business quarter, overall where you look it's just amazing !",,
,,Totally stunning,5,,"What an experience.

A jawdroppingly top notch evening spent watching the Light Show, wandering the grounds, taking in the plant life, the Cloud Forest and much, much more.

We spent around three hours, perhaps more, exploring and looking at everything there is to offer. Peaceful water features and exotic flowers can be found here, with several good amenities and gift shops.

It is worth noting that one should maximise the photograph opportunities because there is such much to capture. We arrived late afternoon and saw the evening draw in and darkness fall so the experience could be remembered from daylight through twilight through to nightfall (see images).

Our standard ticket, including the Cloud Forest, was 14 SGD and the overhead walkway overlooking the trees, facing the Marina Bay Sands hotel with some stunning views, was an additional 8 SGD. All, totally, totally worthwhile.

The Light Show was equally brilliant and reminded me of the Dancing Fountains in Dubai, UAE, keeping in time with harmonic music in the background.

All in all, this has to be a priority for any tourist in Singapore City. A memorable experience.",,
,,Absolutely stunning!,5,,The super trees are out of this world! I highly recommend going when it鈥檚 7:45pm where you will see them all lit up and flashing in time to the tune of a waltz! A must see attraction! It was mesmerising! Everyone gathers around and either lies or sits on the floor and watches the beauty of what has been created here! I went 2 nights in a row I loved it that much!,,
,,Outstanding,5,,"Gardens by the bay was the highlight of our holiday. Walking through the glass conservatory鈥檚 was mesmerising, you just couldn鈥檛 get the smile of my face. As a garden buff I just absolutely loved this place. It has to be one of the best fauna displays I鈥檝e ever seen.
Very well done Singapore鉂わ笍",,
,,Well worth a visit.,5,,"Somewhat apprehensive as to how good this would be but not at all disappointed, a real delight in every way. So much to see and it is quite a height inside in places for those who may not like heights but worth all efforts to see everything. Night viewing is also superb and the music and light show great to watch and listen, would not miss it. Free tours inside not so great as it is just someone reading from a printed paper and the person we had could not really answer any questions not covered in the script, overall excellent. we bought tickets on line saving any lines and at a reduced rate but you do need to collect the tickets prior to getting to the entrance. Miss the cafe in the Flower Dome not a good experience, only place l have been charged for ice for an iced coffee!",,
,,That is the view you want to see at your window,5,,There are no words can discribe this view so I'll give you some pictures that will discribe it better.,,
,,Wonderfull gardens,5,,"Wonderful gardens, amazing metal trees, amazing light show at night, excellent fine dining restaurant. Take a picnic. comfy shoes. Huge green houses with man made waterfall. Need a full day to see if you are a garden enthusiast. Dont Miss it.",,
,,Y,5,,"Really beautiful setting. Lovely that you can walk around the trees for free - particularly when lit up in the evening.
Entry ticket to the flower dome and cloud forest is on the expensive side but I would say it鈥檚 worth is as you can easily spend an hour and a half exploring them - also it鈥檚 lovely and cold in both of these! The flower dome is just ok but the cloud forest is spectacular.",,
,,fanastic,5,,My wife and visited the Gardens by the Bay in May 2017. The amount of plants from all over the world is superb,,
,,Great use of nature,4,,"So nice to have this green space in the city. But most of Singapore is great anyways. The light show was mediocre. Bring bug spray. I was bitten as soon as I came up from the subway. But, mosquitoes love me. So I'm a bias mosquito reviewer :)

Didn't get a chance to explore all of the other attractions like the flower domes, but I'm sure it would have been beautiful.",,
,,Nicely maintained !,4,,Choose the evening time to visit this park so that you can also see the lights show at 7.45pm local time onwards. Both Cloud forest dome and Flower dome were amazing.,,
,,Incredible.,5,,"We took time to see the 鈥淐loud Gardens鈥? These are rain forest gardens that would grow in a cooler climate. So it was extremely pleasant to enjoy the cool air while viewing these beautiful garden. The cost to enter was a bit expensive, however the layout and the range of plants was fantastic.",,
,,A must visit place!,4,,"If you have Gardens by the bay on your itinerary, then plan to visit this place at 5 PM. You can have a stroll in the garden(tram is also available), take a walk on the sky walk (need to purchase tickets approx 20$ adult). Enjoy the lighting in the garden post evening. After this you can visit the water laser show at 7:45 PM which is on the other side of the Marina Bay Sands hotel. You can even go the Observation deck to see the(The top floor of the Marina Bay Hotel) SGD 23 per adult SGD17 for child.",,
,,Amazing installation,5,,"If you don't have enough land to build a botanic garden, the innovative Gardens by the Bay will astonish any visitor. A must for any visitor to Singapore. While the entrance fee is not cheap, one can spend a whole day there to enjoy the beauty and technology of this unique garden",,
,,Light show was amazing!,5,,"This is actually free to walk around - you only pay for entry for the sky walk, cloud gate and flower dome. The huge super trees are amazing and the light show in the evening at 7:45 is a must see! Definitely worth a trip when in Singapore",,
,,Beautiful and annoying,3,,"Gardens are great but you have to walk. There are buggies but you can't hire them and the ones you can catch stop running at five! For over 100 hectares and the heat, this is beyond stupid.
Gardens are free but you have to pay for skywalk, flower garden and cloud forest. The latter was closed when we visited but no reduction in price.
Queues for various things are good but take water as there is only mobile wagon and they are not at all friendly, in fact downright rude.",,
,,Good experience - touristy,4,,"Gardens by the bay are beautiful and a must do in Singapore. They are quite fake and clinical compared to the more rustic parts of he city.

The cloud dome is a must! The flower dome is not as great - you can get free access to flower dome when dining at Pollen.",,
,,A must,5,,"Escape the humidity and come into the gardens, cool and lovely, a must in Singapore. Loved it all, just amazing",,
,,Worth it! The Tulip Festival was a dream.,5,,"I love flowers so I am a bit biased. However, I went during the tulip festival and it was literally a dream. The flowers were vibrant, colorful and fully alive.It was really busy but still I able to see the flowers and take pictures with them. There is a lot around the gardens so if you go there you are in the right spot.",,
,,Amazing place,5,,"Wandered through the gardens and the two domes. Can't speak highly enough of this place. Took so many photos. The domes were fabulous and the airconditioning was working well and a relief from the outside humidity. Whoever set these domes up deserves a medal. Fantastic place to visit but would go back and spend longer. For those that can't walk far, there is a shuttle around the gardens which was $3 for the day, hop on hop off so you won't miss much. Staff were very helpful. We walked from the Singapore Flyer, had a look at the shopping mall at the Marina Bay Sands and through the hotel into the Gardens.",,
,,Amazing,5,,We did this experience over 2 days. We did purchase a dual entry ticket but didn't realise it could only be used on one date not a 24hr period. The purchase cost of the 2nd entry ticket was not expensive. The whole experience is amazing. Look for the amazing art installations throughout the domes. We were fortunate to visit the flower dome during 'Tulip Mania' and for a girl who grew up in cooler climate with grandparents who had an amazing garden I loved it. The cloud dome was equally as interesting. We spent about 4hours in each area. Thoroughly recommend doing the experience so that you finish in the early evening in time to witness the light show that is on every evening at the Super Trees.,,
,,Extensive free gardens plus two stunning paid garden domes.,5,,"The free gardens are extensive including the tree towers area. Paid short treetop walk available at the tree towers. The two paid garden domes are absolutely stunning and have incredible air conditioning too, don't miss these.",,
,,Fantastic experience,5,,"Gardens by the Bay Singapore is a world class attraction and well worth a visit. Due to the humidity and area the site covers I'd advise tourists to prepare by walking some kilometres and improving their fitness prior to leaving home as this will assist you handle what's in store. Our family spent 10 hours on site taking in the attractions and eating, finishing with the Super Tree light show which was choreographed to classical music, absolutely fantastic.",,
,,Architectural Marvel,5,,"Loved this place. Well connected by smrt and the layout of the entire location along with the audio tour and the cloud forest and the done are with every second. Amazing place. Can't wait to visit it again

An awesome place where u can spend hours. You feel on a different planet within the Supertree Grove. Truly an architectural marvel.",,
,,Tulipmania was awesome,5,,Took my parents there. It was a lot of walking and I wished I could have borrowed a wheelchair for them as they got a bit tired. But we thoroughly enjoyed the tulips and beautiful display.,,
,,Just a Wonder .........,5,,"Garden By the Bay Singapore is a new wonder comprise of many amazing things which awaits to amaze one after another. The Super Tree, The Flower Doom, and the Lost world of Cloud Forest literally took me to another world . Simply amazing ....... A must visit place at Singapore and appropriately it takes the place at the list of must visit place of the world.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"Definitely worth visiting, but avoid weekends as it was very busy. Light show was spectacular but didn鈥檛 think it really needed music.",,
,,New wonder in singapore,5,,"We visited singapore after 6/7 years, meanwhile this new wonder has come up. It is amazing place. Lot of flowers, inhouse waterfall, skywalk, night show everything was wonderful, mindblowing",,
,,Mesmerizing light show you shouldn't miss,4,,"The booths at the entrance are selling tickets for the shuttle buses at a cost of $3 per person. It is not considered necessary as it is better to walk around the garden on foot. Don't be tricked for misinterpreting that an entrance fee is necessary as the outdoor garden is absolutely free. Besides, one is allowed to hop on hop off at only designated stops.

The light show under the Supertree Grove is mesmerizing. It runs daily at 7.45 p.m. and 8.45 p.m. The music and lighting arrangement are amazing.",,
,,awesome,5,,Awesome experience. In the evening they a light show accompanied by classic music. Definitely worth to visit.,,
,,AMAZING,5,,"Free entry to these beautiful gardens, so easy to get around, well maintained. Staying for the evening light show is a must. This was our third visit to Singapore & have been to the light show every time. A beautiful sight not to be missed!!!!!!!",,
,,Best Garden,5,,"I love how beautiful this place is. Very detailed, well-though of, lots of amazing plants and trees. This is the place to go if you want to learn more about the plants and why Singapore is a very green city. You could access the Super Trees, Cloud Forest (which is my favorite) and the Flower Dome (i didn't see a lot of flowers though, just lots of cactus). This is an exceptional place. I highly recommend!

Tip: Book your tickets via Klook.com to get discounted tickets.",,
,,Forest of the world,5,,"An awesome place
A must to visit
You will not regret
Good to go just before sunset so you get to see before and after the lights
In fact you can spend half a day there and around
I did not add photos as you have enough
Have a good time",,
,,Not to be missed,5,,In the Marina Bay area about a 15 minute walk from MRT. Very impressive buildings and displays of plants from all around the world,,
,,Phenomenal!,5,,Gardens by the Bay is undescribable. Catch the music and light show at the Super Tree Grove. You will not be disappointed. Magical,,
,,Unique,5,,"We went at night when everything is lighted up a blue color, and it was free to enter and walk around. Maybe the entrance fee is for other stuff but just to walk there feels good too.",,
,,19-May-18,5,,"I enjoyed this place very much.
So many great plants. Unique and huge.
I ate at Satay by the bay.

Be careful, the fans are as big as helicopters' fan and the smoke come from many directions.
You will end up smelling like a huge piece of burnt meat, especially your hair and your clothes.

Funny experience.",,
,,Awesome,5,,"A must visit during Singapore trip. Truly amazing experience, the government has done a wonderful job in creating a world class garden and with a message on creating a sustainable environment by prevent Global warming and giving back to nature.",,
,,Happy moments,5,,I and my wife had free time on a weekend it was a Sunday morning we decided to go garden by the bay it was so lovely.,,
,,Must see.,4,,This is a must do in your time in Singapore! We got confused looking online for prices but it's free! It's free to walk around the garden and watch the evening light show. If you would like to go into the flower garden ect. this will cost. I really recommend the light show there is space for everyone to see and get good pictures.,,
,,Amazing,5,,"Lots of people there. No matter day time or night time, it's amazing. It is the must must go place. In my mind, no. 1 of place you should go.",,
,,Amazing,5,,At the beginning of the spring it was very beautiful to walk around. The garden is nice and well taken care . It is very warm so it makes it difficult to stay out. But the beauty of flowers makes it worth.,,
,,Best indoor garden,5,,"Best indoor garden. Fit for school study tour, research, and photo. You can take photo with sakura flower without go to Japan.",,
,,A must see,5,,"Just lovely! Breathtaking scenery, worth paying to go up the supertree. Definitely a must when you come to Singapore.",,
,,Casual visit,5,,Beautifully created ... a modern masterpiece. The Domes are a delight and a walk through the rest of the gardens is very pleasant.,,
,,Beautiful!,5,,"What a stunning place to walk around. Definitely worth a visit, as you鈥檒l be blown away by the many things to look at. A lot of thought has gone into the design of the area, and it was a joy to spend a few hours here.",,
,,Beauty and science brought together,5,,I was here with family and the domes are very beautiful and enjoyable for everyone. There is also a late night light show which is worth watching,,
,,Lovely gardens,5,,Lovely gardens with great views on Marina Bay Sands. Easy to access with MRT. The rain forest dome is very nice and the perfect way to cool down. Make sure you go on a nice day as they close the skywalk in case of rain and thunder. We stayed there to watch sunset and see the lights come on.,,
,,Amazing,4,,Gardens are my favorite places to chillax and the Gardens By The Bay offers a wide spectrum of flora and fauna across the world. The extent of detailing ending with the laser show makes it remarkable experience.,,
,,GARDENS OF SG,3,,Slow walk at night must be best time on singapore gardens by the bay.It safe and full of fun.That singapore for.,,
,,Photographers paradise,5,,"The gardens are spectacular. The cloud forest and flower dome are incredible. They get a bit crowded but, if you are patient there are plenty of amazing shots to be had!",,
,,Disappointing. Feel robbed!,2,,"After paying $58 for 2 tickets to the domes we were expecting to be really wow'd.
We went to the flower dome first and we were just so disappointed. It was rammed with tourists, selfie sticks and pushy people trying to get that perfect Instagram photo. Despite the many signs saying not to to touch the flowers and plants, so many were broken and dead from people sitting on ledges where they trail and grabbing roses for pictures. I just didn't get the attraction.. the dome is impressive and many of the plants are really beautiful, however the organisation and displays were nothing out of this world. We wandered for 20 mins or so then just had to leave.
We had high hopes for cloud forest and were hoping for the trip to be salvaged! Not the case unfortunately. The queue for the dome stretched for what seemed like miles. After about a 20 minute wait we were in, and then told it was a minimum 1 hour wait to go to the top! (I should mention we went at 6pm which is perhaps peak time so that people can can catch the light show, even still, it was really terrible crowd control.) We got in, the 'mountain' is cool to look at I guess, although I couldn't get past it being a man made structure and not really sure what I was supposed to be marvelling at. Again the queuing and noise and selfies just ruined whatever nice experience we could have had.
We didn't bother waiting the hour to get to the top, not sure what is up there but if it's just views of the city I'm sure there is better vantage points from elsewhere.
All in all, we didn't enjoy the experience and can't really understand the hype. $28 each is WAY too much.
The positives were the area is nice and the tree grove area was cool.
Unless your a huge plant enthusiast or have a big budget to work off, I would give it a miss.",,
,,Nice tulips at the Flower Dome,5,,"We came here just to catch the tulips during the last weekend and it鈥檚 our second visit to the Gardens by the Bay.

Tulips were nicely displayed although some were already fully opened and almost gone.

Would recommend a trip here as they change their displays. This is like a large temperature controlled green house that has air conditioning and flowers from colder regions are displayed here.
Nice half day visit and lots of photo opportunities.",,
,,Must see,5,,Number one attraction in Singapore. The best time to go is 7.45 or 8.45 pm when lighting shows take place. For the gardens itself maybe better is to visit before dark if you are interested in plants. Recommended,,
,,Amazing,5,,This is such a nice place to visit. If you have a kids I would definitely recommend the kids gardens by the bay. It has a great waterpark and playground. Fantastic place for kids!,,
,,unique and awesome place to visit,5,,"This is one of the most wow places you will visit any time , the garden is made awesome , the sky trees are awesome , all put together its a must see in singapore",,
,,Impressive,5,,"Outstanding, impressive, quiet, soothing, one of a kind. We were blown away with the surreal music, lights and ambience. Make sure to go after lunch and stay till the evening to catch the sound and light. Excellent workmanship. Don't miss it even though expensive.",,
,,Great place to visit,5,,Great place to visit. They have got 2 sections and both of them are really interesting to visit. Rain forest is amazing and so is gardens. They also have superglow tree which is a sight to watch. You should reach at this place at around 7.30 pm to enjoy light and sound show. Show is treat to eyes and does not require any entry fee.,,
,,Fantabulous,5,,There are botanical gardens in almost every city of the world.....But this is beyond comparison. The sheer size is huge and that too maintained as well as this requires extra praise.....A MUST MUST VISIT for the Singapore trip,,
,,Impressive!,5,,The lighy and sound show is definitely not to be missed. They have different themes everyday and the theme when we visited was Hollywood soundtracks. Reach at least half h hour before the show starts so you can grab a place to lie down. That's the best way to see the show.,,
,,Beautiful,5,,A must do amazing display of plants and flowers Return at night for the light show wont disappoint .,,
,,Garden Rhapsody Light Show...truly amazing!!!,5,,"The Garden Rhapsody Light Show is a light show (of course) held at Gardens by the Bay each night at 07:45 and 08:45. It lasts around fifteen minutes and it is truly enjoyable. The show is for free and it is not to be missed out.
There is also a Light & Water show that is held on the other side of Marina Bay Sands that begins each night at 08 PM and 09 PM. That is a 15-minute show for free. There is an extra show on schedule which is held at 10 PM both on Friday and on Saturday.
If you are in a rush you can arrange your time so to watch both shows the same evening. Getting from Gardens by the Bay to the Light & Water Show takes around 20/25 minutes on foot.",,
,,Beautiful indoor garden,5,,"If you ever visit Singapore, gardens by the Bay is a must see. It鈥檚 a giant indoor and out door full of beautiful plants and amazing scene for photography. There are a couple of eateries in the area.",,
,,Worth a visit,5,,Try and go when they do the misting in the cloud dome. If you can be at the top when it starts and walk down a few levels it gives you a good view of the misting in the middle part. It is also nice and cooling in there if you wish to escape some of the heat. Amazing waterfall when you first walk in. The flower dome is not as good as the cloud dome but it鈥檚 a nice enough walk round or if you like to see different types of flowers/trees/cacti.,,
,,cold place,5,,"huge indoor garden, lots to walk. but its best place to take photos. light show in evening is good and ldeal for a good walk",,
,,Really fun visit,5,,It was really fun. Saw a lot of incredible and beautiful things specially in the cloud forest. Be careful if you have a DSLR when you enter cloud forest. You will see a waterfall right away and your camera might get wet. It is really worth it buying $28 which you can go to 2 attractions. We went to cloud forest and flower dome. Always check their schedule for maintenance because my fiancee got disappointed that the sky dome was closed for maintenance.,,
,,A must do in Singapore,5,,"My wife and I visited Gardens by the Bay on a Wednesday night arriving at about 5.30pm, that way we were able to see the gardens in both daylight and at night time.

The gardens are very popular with tourists so I suggest you prebook your admission tickets beforehand to avoid the queues.

We spent about four and half hours there with the highlights being the skywalk at night and the symphony light show.

Overall a very enjoyable experience and a must visit when in Singapore.",,
,,Absolutely must see if you are in Singapore,5,,The gardens themselves are absolutely stunning but further to this the amazingly designed glass houses that house the cloud garden etc. As stunning as it is there is also a really good message about sustainability.,,
,,My Go To Garden in Singapore,5,,Gardens By The Bay is my favorite of all the gardens in Singapore. I really like the air conditioning in the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. It means I can visit at anytime of the day and still be in comfortable temperature. I can stay here from opening to closing. When the sun goes down I head outdoors to witness the light show. I like to walk around and sit by the grass. It鈥檚 always a relaxing day for me in Gardens By The Bay.,,
,,DON鈥橳 MISS,5,,This was the most amazing place really interesting loads of amazing photos to be taken. A perfect addition to gardens by the bay,,
,,Great day out!,5,,The gardens of the Bay were a great place to explore. We visited both glass domes and walked around the super tree grove. You get amazing views of Marina Bay Sands and the surrounding area. The domes are cool so are the perfect way to escape the heat. Priced as a tourist attraction would be but would highly recommend to anyone visiting Singapore and suitable for all ages.,,
,,Not to be missed,5,,"Yes, this is among the top tourist attractions in Singapore, so it will likely be crowded. So go early. But go. It's not quite a garden (doesn't feel natural) and it's not quite a theme park (no rides), but it DOES feel like a combination of the two.",,
,,So Well Done,5,,The entry fee is S$28 and gets you entry to the two main exhibits. The gardens are well laid out and has detailed descriptions for the various plants on display. The attraction is airconditioned which makes the walking tour very pleasant.,,
,,As beautiful as the paradise,5,,"It is best visited about two hours before the sundown. Thus, you can enjoy the giant Grooves and the light shows in the night. You can also enjoy a lot of places near the artificial lake there. If you are getting bach using the MRT you will enjoy your way there with amazing unforgettable views of the gardens.",,
,,Amazing!,5,,"The Gardens by the Bay are beautiful. We paid $28 for the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome. The Supertree Grove is free. We also paid $3 for the shuttle. It is a long walk from Bayfront MRT to the Gardens. We spent about 5 hours at the Gardens. We went to the Cloud Forest, the Flower Dome, and then Supertree Grove. We spent about 30 minutes at the Supertree. The views are beautiful at the Domes and the overpass walkway to Marina Bay.",,
,,Cactus!!!,3,,"Love the flower dome inside have lot of different species flower and cactus!! Overall still ok~ just sometimes too much annoying kids and baby trolley~! To those parents, PLS~!! This is not playground for kids~!!",,
,,Beautiful gardens that really can be enjoyed day and night,5,,Wonderful gardens that if you can get up high at night to view the fantastic light show of the man made 鈥渢rees鈥?,,
,,"Flower Dome, Cloud Dome and Tree Top Walk",5,,"All three venues were amazing. The flower Dome had a spectacular display of Tulips of many varieties. The Cloud Dome with a water fall was accessible via a lift to the top. The staff were very helpful as my sister was in a wheel chair.
The Tree Top Walk area is free with plenty of food venues but there is a fee to go up inside a tree. You can spend as much time as you like in the venues.",,
,,Amazing. Terrific.,5,,This is another 鈥榤ust see鈥?for Singapore. It is simply amazing and make sure you go both during the day and in the evening as well - to see the nightly light show. Fantastic.,,
,,Make sure you see the light show!,5,,"Make sure you schedule the light show into your plans! I visited this wonderful attraction with my husband and we caught the 7.45pm show. It was amazing to be able to lie down on the warm ground and look up at the supertrees dancing to music. It was quite busy but here was room for everyone to watch the show.

We also visited the bar at the top of the tallest tree. You have to pay to enter but you get a wristband that has a tear off token for a free drink. Worth it for the views of the Singapore skyline! We were hoping to see sunset but unfortunately the sun was behind the marina bay sands hotel.

There are many attractions in the park aside from the super trees. We had dinner at the satay by the bay food court which had a wide selection of food choices and the stalls were reasonably priced.",,
,,Worth a visit,3,,If you are interested in flowers this is the place to be the flower dome otherwise it is not for you. The cloud forest was interesting and good.,,
,,Fantastic day here,5,,We wandered though both domes and really enjoyed the wide variety of flowers and other plants - the Cloud Dome was a great experience. I walked so much but it was all just lovely.,,
,,What a show,5,,A must see while in singapore. During the day the Tree top walk is spectacular. At night the light show is awesome. We we advised by our tour guide to lie on the ground for the show and it was great.,,
,,A Must See,5,,Was so impressed with both domes. Flower and plant displays are out of this world. Spent a few hours going round both domes and so worth it. Quite spectacular. A must see if in Singapore.,,
,,Go there! Fantastic during the the day and in the evening,5,,We enjoyed any minute at the Gardens by the Bay. Just another fantastic spot in Singapur. The show in the evening was very nice. We can only recommend a visit.,,
,,Out of the World.,5,,Gardens by the Bay is so beautiful that it cannot be described with words. The night show at 08:30 is breathtaking. You must reach this place by 06:00pm to see the Domes (Cloud Forest & Flower Dome) then you must run for the light show. It is a complete family entertainment.,,
,,Incredible feat,5,,These gardens are a tribute to the hard work of the people who designed them and especially the people who maintain them. We went into both domes and enjoyed the controlled atmosphere while it was steamy outside! We were lucky enough to go when there was a special tulip garden in bloom. Stunning. A must see for gardeners,,
,,Beautiful,4,,The cloud gardens were beautiful. The flower garden was not that exciting unless you鈥檙e very into flowers. Both were a great way to get out of the hot Singapore weather. The super trees were so unique and cool looking with great views from the walkway. The entire area is so green and pretty. Definitely worth checking out!,,
,,nice but expensive,4,,"very beautiful gardens, beatiful glass houses. The only thing that I found a bit dissapointing, that after paying the full amount of entrance fee, ($ 28) you have to pay extra to go up the walkway in the artificial trees.",,
,,Well worth it,5,,A corner for every geography of the world supported by a large domed roof this is an excellent choice to get out of the heath without being in a sterile shopping centre. Well worth the visit,,
,,Beautiful!,5,,The light show at night with the dancing lights is a must see. It's at the supertrees. Magical and breathtakingly beautiful.,,
,,A MUST VISIT ATTRACTION,5,,"I have seen lot of reviews about this attractions and thought slightly overrated. But once you see the light show, You will agree that this is a must visit attraction in SG.",,
,,Great,5,,So impressed with both domes. Flower dome actually brought back memories of home. Both were also a welcome reprieve from the heat. Would loved to have explored more of the grounds but it started to rain in earnest so we ended up catching MRT back to hotel. Overall definitely worth a visit. Staff very friendly too.,,
,,Amazing and Wonderful Experience,5,,"Everything in gardens by the bay are simply amazing. Aside from one will enjoy the beauty of this place, you will learn at the same time about the different plants, trees etc and its habitat.

This place is definitely one of the best attraction whenever you are in Singapore. Ensure to put them in your bucket list!",,
,,Must see,5,,"Must visit this whilst the light show is on, the music and lights is amazing. Well worth the trip to watch this free event.",,
,,Fresh Greens ! Lively and lovely,5,,"Worth the visit, on of the best developed and maintained gardens. Simply Fantastic! Time well spent in this great garden.",,
,,Flower Dome and Cloud Forest a must-see!,5,,"Our trip to both the Flower Dome (largest glass greenhouse worldwide) and Cloud Forest (tallest indoor waterfall worldwide) conservancies was absolutely breathtaking. My fianc茅e and I both love nature so we were thrilled to spend hours admiring the beautiful and unique flora from all over the world. The special Tulip array was so pretty. Singapore may be hot year-round but these conservancies are perfectly alright under the afternoon sun because of the indoor air-conditioning. Despite going on a Saturday with large crowds as expected, the overall flow was very smooth and I never felt claustrophobic at any point. There is typically a queue taking the lift up to the Cloud and Treetop Walks in the Cloud Forest, but it moves along fast. The view of the indoor waterfall were stunning and beautiful. I must commend the Gardens as well for emphasizing the need for conservation and the protection of our natural resources, through the educational displays all around. Speaking of which, please be careful when up-close so as to avoid damaging the precious flora.",,
,,make sure you go to the night show,5,,"Great area to spend a lot of time. The light show is great. Took taxi back to hotel, but be quick to get to taxi stand as there are large ques",,
,,Very Enjoyable - strongly recommended,5,,"I arrived about 6pm with pre-paid internet ticket, so I was able to go straight into the Flower Dome. It was nicely set out, easy to walk around, the cacti plants most impressive and the Tulip Display was great. Then onto the Rain Forest, also enjoyable, the Hidden Garden was very well done. Next I followed the crowd (as it was 7.30pm) to the Supertree Grove and found a vantage spot to set up camera and tripod a bit away form the crowd sitting on the ground. The light show and music was just amazing, well worth the trip. Next time I will just watch without the camera. I strongly recommend the Gardens by the Bay experience for everyone.",,
,,3 sections and a peaceful evening place to be in,5,,"This is divided in 3 sections and all the sections have beauty of their own. The flower section, the butterfly section and the open garden section. There is option of PAID and UNPAID visit to this area. Choose as per your time and convenience.!",,
,,Natures Delight,4,,You can spend a long day here and I can bet you will not get bored. This is a delight for nature-lovers. A must go place in Singapore.,,
,,Awesome,4,,Unfortunately we only saw by day or it would be 5 star There's so much to see it's a amazing we were there before the crowds arrived which was great for pics but a lot of attractions don't open till 10am Well worth going even if you don't venture into the attractions you can spend hours there lots of food choices too,,
,,Zoo,5,,Fantastic during the day and/or night. Both the flower and cloud dorms are a must see. Easily accessible by the MRT,,
,,The most beautiful place for plant lovers!,5,,A wonderful place to see all types of orchids..tulips and flowers from all over the world. A well laid out adventure for a few hours of non stop photography. Be sure to find out when the light shows take place..twice a night..early evening and later in the night. A wonderful place for a romantic experience.,,
,,Cloud Dome was refreshing escape,5,,"What a wonderful morning in the gardens. We went to the sky way atop the trees which gave a fantastic perspective & to the Cloud Dome. We had bought a ticket for the Flower Dome as well but ran out of energy after leaving the gardens to enjoy lunch on top of the Marina Sands Hotel.
There were so ma orchids in the Cloud Dome.
The whole experience was sensory overload!
Such an amazing place. It is obvious tremendous care, energy was put into the planing of these gardens.
Definitely wish we had made the Flower Dome too, yet we had walked from our hotel the Pan Pacific and ended up walking over 6 Miles during the adventure filled Day. We were not sad to just relax in the pool after the fun.",,
,,worth going even if not into horticulture,4,,"definitely worth paying to go up the walkway, great views and photos
other parts were OK, great layout
a fair few drink stands available throughout which is great
didnt sample restaurant but looked liked good food
we went in May, off season, in the heat of summer and with large queues there could be issues finding shade but off season it was good
could send 1 hour or 3 here depending on interest in plants etc",,
,,Our way of coping with the heat...,5,,"This was our second visit to GBTB. We catch the mrt to bayfront.
We have been in the domes so skipped them this time. Our tip is to wear casual easily drying clothing when visiting. Go to the children's water park (it's free), get drenched and then walk around the outdoor gardens. Then repeat. It's the only way we can survive the heat! Ok it doesnt make for instgrammable photos and is a little ungraceful, but you will be cool. You can rent a locker at the park for $1-2 dollars (You can only unlock once though). There is a water fountain with chilled water.
If you do have young children, bring them here for sure.
We decided to eat at marina bay sands food court. It was reasonably priced to my surprise.",,
,,Mesmerizing Solar Light Show,5,,Take a walk through a special place that is magical and breathtaking. It is like walking into a rain forest .The flower gardens are just beautiful and the smell of the flowers permeates the air it is like smelling perfume. The views are magnificent over looking the bay and there is a viewing platform to walk around. The gardens feature plants from different countries. The solar light show brings all your senses to life and takes you into a fairy land of colors and music that touches your soul. Remember to take your camera to video this show because you will want to relive it again and show your family and friends. There is an upstairs restaurant and there are plenty of hawkers markets with delicious food. This is a must see attraction. Very Highly Recommended.,,
,,Take My Breath Away,5,,"Gardens by the Bay are a must even if you only have a 1 night stop over in Singapore this is the place to visit. You can get there by either popping on the metro or catching a taxi neither are expensive.
The two domes nestle between the bay and a tropical garden growing magnificent trees, shrubs and stunning flowers. The flower dome exhibits flowers from all over the world. Each section throngs with life, colour and vitality, its simply amazing. You will be more than impressed by the succulents and cactus section it's almost as though the aliens have landed. I wont rave on as its great to be surprised but please do find time to visit.
We didn't have time to visit the rainforest dome but we will next visit to Singapore. In the low season, if not too crowded, enjoy a coffee and cake after browsing through the complexes shop which has some delightful souvenirs.
Cost reasonable, staff helpful and its suitable for the disabled as there is a lift available.",,
,,Nice olace,4,,"Very nice place, especially the mountain dome has something mystic, I suggest you come there around the sunset time which makes it even nicer. Also the light show at 19:45 is worth paying a visit",,
,,Unbelievable Gatdens,5,,The gardens in Singapore are wonderful in scope and offer closed in gardens with different temperature zones. It is a great way to spend a day,,

Through this forum, we found Luci wheelchair, a wonderful company that let us rent a wheelchair for her at only $10.00 a day.The laser show and flower dome is not to be missed.

Why? I gave 5 star, because of this place has made me happy and comfortable with the service that politely and friendly ..
Thanks.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,"What an excellent concept. A free outside light show. Get there early and find a spot near the artistic trees and wait till sunset. The metal artistic trees are lit up and change colours to a music theme. Take a seat cushion, but the best viewing is laying on your back (as long as you can view at least two to three trees) and enjoying the show",,
,,Daytime visit,5,,Amazing array of plants and sculptures. Worlds biggest indoor waterfall. Amazing stuff here. Dont book a tour. Just get a cab and go visit. A must see in Singapore.,,
,,Fantastic day trip,5,,Lots of interesting thing to see and do. All inside climate controlled domes. Should plan to spend at least half a day for the cloud forrest and the flower dome. It can get crowded.,,
,,Amazing!,5,,Amazing site! A must see if visiting Singapore. Easy to get too and lots to see and do. Lots of signage and restrooms.,,
,,Well worth a visit,5,,This is really a great place to visit. I was surprised but very pleased that the conservatories are actually cooler than the outside.

,,Amazing,5,,"Absolutely beautiful gardens, recommend doing the cloud forest dome and also the Supergrove tree skywalk.",,
,,More than just plants and flowers,5,,What a wonderful exhibition. The gardens bring an awareness of plants and their benefits to our atmosphere in such an easy to follow way. The usual Singaporean passion for modernity is uniquely on display. Take a picnic and settle in to watch the evening lightshow.,,
,,Lovely place,5,,Great to wander around for free. Charges to go into the domes and the sky walk. But the (free) music and light show was great. I'm not sure I'd want to see it from the sky walk. Be prepared for a slow exit to the MRT station.,,
,,A must see.,5,,We visited at night for the light show. We all laid back and enjoyed the lights and music. It wasn't too busy and our teenagers loved it. Overload of the senses. My older parents also enjoyed the show.,,
,,Come by day and night,5,,"Take one hour to come here during the day and during the evening. Both views are spectacular and worth a visit. What you should try too, is to get up to the bar to have the view all over the garden. This I'd do definitely when coming by night. The entire scenery is well made, never saw something like this before. A nice place to be next to all the modern buildings.",,
,,Good for family outing,4,,"It's good for family outing and can make the children learn about different types of plants. If the car park rate can be cheaper, make more elevator, then will be more easy for family.",,
,,A greenhouse with aircondition.,5,,Never miss the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome. Our visit was in the afternoon and it felt pleasant because both were greenhouses with air condition. It was like visiting Holland because of the tulips. Such flower doesn't grow in the tropics but it does in one of the air-conditioned greenhouses.,,
,,Really enjoyable day out,5,,"It's definitely worth getting the combo ticket for the two domes, they are excellent. It's a beautiful place with nice views of the city.",,
,,Impressive display!,4,,Buying tickets online was easy and the tulips on display are truly spectacular. Overall we had a wonderful feeling after the 2 hours and must acknowledge the efforts to achieve this result. Well done!,,
,,Great Place to Enjoy the Sun,5,,"I guess this is the only attraction to enjoy the sun with cool air. It is a good experience, the flowers were nice too. Visit early morning to avoid the afternoon crowd which can be very bad.",,
,,Exquisite Gardens,5,,"I recommend a visit, and take your time. This is a wonderful spot. From walking though the domes among the exotic flower displays, to walking up the waterfall. And don't forget the interesting trees outside, for me - very high off the ground, but worth the scare!",,
,,Excellent place to know in Singapore,5,,"It's a perfect place to walk and enjoy the tropical weather and nature in Singapore. You can walk for free in the gardens with several acres of nature and visit the flower dome or the seven floors gardens and climb by stairs or elevator 20 meters to walk in the top of the gardens, take excellent pictures and enjoy with the family.",,
,,Fab day out,5,,"Beautiful gardens to visit, spotless clean. From someone who thinks that a flower is a flower, I was very impressed with the whole experience. Free to enter, lots of water activities for kids, eating places and at night everything is lit up...great time.",,

,,Child friendly and full of surprises,5,,This is second time I visited the place and it鈥檚 still full of surprises and it maintain well. It鈥檚 good place to visit for whole family from young to elderly.,,
,,"Awesome, architecturally filled, human-made, landmark nature park on reclaimed land",5,,"This is a beautiful, 101-hectare, botanical garden-park and provides a sense of Singapore鈥檚 multiculturalism. This nature park includes an amazing iconic supertree grove of tree-like structures, the Golden Garden, the Silver Garden, Dragonfly Lake, a cloud forest conservatory, a flower dome conservatory, Malay Garden, Indian Garden and its beautiful displays, Colonial Garden, World of Palms, Web of Life area with its tree-shaped animals, , a children鈥檚 garden and play area, horticultural themed gardens, beautiful greenery, raised high-level viewing walkways, beautiful floral clock, beautiful sculptures, water ponds, and more. The entire place looks amazing when lit up at night, especially the round-topped, supertrees.

There are lots of signage throughout this botanical garden-park, displaying information on what you are viewing.

WOW . . . An amazing place and a must-see when in Singapore.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"We alighted from the Bayfront MRT station and walked towards the gardens. You could pay for a shuttle to take you to the cooled conservatories and other places in the park, it is quite big. However, we opted to walk. The walk was a little warm, but relatively comfortable. Just follow the signs to get to where you want to go. The free portions of the park are wonderful to walk around. However, we went there on a Sunday, so there were quite a few family and friends sitting on the ground enjoying a picnic.",,
,,"Go to the ouside gardens, domes maybe",4,,"We loved the ourside gardens, by night and during the day. The light and sound show in the evening was a bit tacky, but in a good way. Really enjoyed it. Surprisingly this is all for free, while the two domes are a bit pricy to visit. For us, they were not that interesting. If you want to see some exotic plants and flowers, you can do that in the domes, but for us it was not so interesting (especially with the botanic gardens the cit offers as well!)",,
,,Amazing horticultural attraction,5,,Amazing venue showcasing the natural beauty of plants combined with the design ingenuity of clever human beings,,
,,Awesome flower park,5,,Tulip flower show was great...cloud forest was amazing... must visit in singapore. Good food options,,
,,Not to expect much from the Tulip gardens!!!,3,,"I have visited Gardens by the bay multiple times, but this is the first time i am disappointed. The Tulip gardens inside the Dome have already bloomed. If you are looking for a beautiful flower trip, you should have gone few weeks ago.",,
,,Wow wow wow,5,,This is a stunning incredibly created amazing location even if you aren鈥檛 a garden lover. The two display domes were stunning!!!!!,,
,,Worth a watch light show,5,,"The light show on the evening is excellent and give you a peace of mind and one should not miss the opportunity, its just 15- 30 mins show...",,
,,A Must See when in Singapore - Amazing,5,,"Gardens by the Bay has something for everyone. From the man made Waterfall, Flower Dome, Skyway, Super Tree Grove and much much more. Absolutely brilliantly designed and beautifully crafted.",,
,,Saddening Garden Visit,3,,"At first I was so excited when my aunt told me that there was Tulip festival at Gardens by The Bay. Though I've ever been there two times before, but me and my sisters were so excited. But when we reached there, it was not as cold as before. And the flowers were dried.",,
,,Mom and I had fun :),5,,Both my mom and I had fun visiting the award winning orchid exhibition in the Cloud Forest. We enjoyed our mother-daughter bonding time in addition to getting my mom to exercise without her realising it!,,
,,A must visit!,5,,"If you are in Singapore, you should definitely visit this place. The charm here will simply enthrall you. Do not miss the Supertree grove light show at 7.45 pm and 8.45 pm. Also you can check out the highest artificial waterfall in the world and a walk across the 22 m high OCBC skywalk.",,
,,Review of Gardens By the Bay,5,,We have enjoyed a lots at Garden By the Bay . We bought entry tickets with promotion prices. It is worth to visit . Beautiful Tulips and amazing tallest indoor waterfall.,,
,,Bad experience,2,,I went on 12 May and it was a tulips season and plants mostly in bad shape and tulips were all over bloom. Cloud forest waiting time took too long.,,
,,Garden by the Bay flower and cloud dome,4,,It was relaxing at times but has many visitors or tour group. Nice ambience and with AIr con. You may need to bring a scarf as it can be quite cold.,,
,,A must if staying over for a few days,5,,Fantastic domes and the restaurant atop of the trees was excellent. Beautiful displays and walks around the gardens were a good way to get over the long flight from the UK,,
,,The two Domes,5,,"Garden by the Bay did not disappoint. The two domes are awesome if you like plant, flowers cactus, aloe. We were fortunate to see the tulip collection and the so many flowers that go with it.",,
,,Just fabulous,5,,A really good morning out. Lovely gardens in air conditioned comfort. Beautifully maintained and well worth the visit.,,
,,Very good,4,,It is really good and the bridge walk was really good. If there was some kind of shelter it would have helped along the walk way. It was very hot and humid. The best time is evening.,,
,,A must see in Singapore,5,,"Don鈥檛 miss it ! The whole place is perfect for solo, couples and families The waterfalls are talking your heart!",,
,,A good place to hang around,4,,Another good place to hang around and if you reach there in the evening could experience the Supertree grove show which is spectacular. There is a lot to see around this area and could easily spend close to 3 hrs at this place.,,
,,Pay Per View,4,,"Visited on last week and had an nice time. Was not certain what to exspect and the associated cost due to the website being a little confusing. The grounds were beautiful and well maintained. The live band was a nice touch. The were a couple of free attractions but were overshadowed by the pay attractions ( hard to find online and on site ) I spent a long time looking for the sun pavilion( cactus) and found It on my third attempt. The kid area, sun pavilion and a couple of other things are free. The 2 conservatories cost $28, the ride around the gardens with tour $8 and the sky thing to walk among the trees was $8. There are also a Mcdonalds and an exclusive resteraunt on site. I went in the day time and it was nice but it probably would have been magical at night. I am not opposed to charging for attractions but it may have been better had it been one set fee. I would recommend going but bear the above in mind.",,
,,A Futuristic Masterpiece!!!,5,,"A Incredible Glimpse into The Future Of Garden Concepts and Artistic Creations. Everything is Art in The 鈥淕ardens By the Bay鈥? The Plants, Their Disposition and Selection...
The Sculptures Positioned Esthetically in the Green...
The Architecture That Encapsulate or Hold All Living Things...
Gardens by the Bay is a Unique and Magical Place That Should Not Be Missed When in Singapore!!!",,
,,Selfie heaven,5,,"Very good set up , even if you are not into gardening . Displays are impressive and you can see where the over $1Billion was spent definitely worth a visit",,
,,A must to see at sunset,5,,The Gardens by the Bay in Singapore are stunning. The plants and flowers were the most beautiful I have ever seen. We thought we would go for a short visit and ended up staying for hours. It is cool and so relaxing inside the domes and easy walking and plenty of seats. The amount of work done in the domes is amazing and so enjoyable. This is a must to do in Singapore.,,
,,Must see for everyone visiting singapore,5,,Do not miss this one out id your todo list in Singapore A beautiful place to visit doe all family members,,
,,Lovely places,4,,Kids love it so much..when we went there...its still tulip season..so a lot of beautiful tulips .a lot of beautiful spots also to take pic..really a moment that we cant forget..,,
,,Gardens,4,,Amazing what they have created on reclaimed land. Gardens very lush for such a young area. A very heavy tourist area which detracted a little from enjoying the area. They managed ques well. Cloud Garden was spectacular creation and my favourite of the two gardens. Both were worth seeing but the cloud garden most unique experience for a man made under cover garden.,,
,,World Class & Amazing,5,,There is NO easy way to describe the Supertrees. Vertical gardens from the future. Go more than once. Walk it by day & go back for the nightly light & music show. REALLY AMAZING.,,
,,Gardens by the bay,5,,"WOW. What a wonderful spot go visit. If you can go at night, it is really beautiful to see. A must if you are in Singapore",,
,,garden Visit,5,,A breathtaking view of a magnificent garden situated close to the sea and many other beautiful areas in Singapore. Well manicured and Highly recommended visit,,
,,Lovely to see!,5,,Such a lovely outing with spectacular flowers -spend enough time there and take any photos! We went when all tulips was on display - beautiful!,,
,,Lovely day and evening,4,,Spent lovely day here enjoying all the attractions on offer. Took the excellent bus tour around the Gardens and came back in the evening to see the breath taking light show which is not to be missed. Don't leave Singapore without visiting here.,,
,,A splendid visit,5,,"Arrived at the gardens more by chance than anything else. Didn't arrive until 3pm which worked out just enough time to visit the Cloud Forest and Flower domes, grab a bite to eat and catch the sound & light show. Next time we visit we will go earlier and make a full day out of it. Lots and lots to see. The sound and light show in the evening is just fantastic. My 4 and 6 year old girls were amazed. They also loved the cloud forest dome. The gardens are not to be missed, great value for money. We will be back for sure!",,
,,A must go in Singapore,5,,"This is a place what you shouldn鈥檛 miss. Free entrance, easy to get there and the light show was so good. After the show you can go shopping nearby Highly recommend",,
,,Must-do,5,,This is definitely one of the major attractions in the city. I suggest getting tickets to both conservatories then catching the light show at 7:45.,,
,,Go see it,4,,There were beautiful flowers and stuff to see here. Definitely one of the places in Singapore to see,,
,,Heaven for (my) Mom,5,,"My mom loves plants, so she was ecstatic when we arrived at Flower Dome. Luckily there was Tulip exhibition during our visit, so no need to pay a visit to Keukenhoff If you bring elderly or children, I suggest to take the shuttle to Flower Dome and Cloud Forest because it's quite far and the Flower Dome & Cloud Forest area are quite large so you need to save energy to walk around to explore it. Especially if after that you want to go to the iconic Supertree area and observing the free gardens too. Believe me, you wont be able to feel your legs after Although the entrance fee is quite expensive, but it was worth every penny seeing my mom so happy in her element. Also you can save money by bringing your own meal and tumbler, because they provide water fountain so you can refill your tumbler. You can eat your food outside the Flower Dome/Cloud Forest, they provide benches there. Or simply go to some area in the free gardens. Alocate a whole day here, dont rush it and enjoy the fresh air.. if you bored, pay a visit to the mall then come back for the lights show at night.",,
,,Splendid,5,,"Just walking among the super trees is great. Then book for 8 S$ a walk on the high path, it鈥檚 awesome. It reminds me of the movie avatar",,
,,Worth a visit,5,,I highly recommend a visit to this marvellous creation.. It has some amazing flora and fauna which you will not see anywhere at one place.,,
,,Fantastic definitely worth visiting,5,,Amazing place. The cloud forest is awesome. Allow plenty of time to enjoy this amazing place. The flower dome has beautiful gardens from around the world.,,
,,Great day,5,,"Beautiful place to visit at night, you do need to book ahead to make sure you have the time and day you wish to go at.",,
,,Raining 鈽旓笍 day in Singapore,5,,"Fantastic day out, to start with we did the cloud 鉀咃笍 dome, which was excellent, when this was finished the rain had stopped so did the outside gardens followed by the flower garden, great day out but be prepared to walk at least 4 miles",,
,,Worth a visit,5,,If you are going to Singapore don鈥檛 miss this. We went with a tour and really enjoyed it. We lay down on the grass at sunset to watch.,,
,,OWnderful place,5,,"It is a wonderful place, a must go in Singapore. The flower dome and the cloud dome are marvelous. The garden in also awesome. it is better to go in the afternoon and stay till evening when the light shows are on (at 7:45pm). I think when it is very hot during the afternoon it is wise to enjoy the flower dome and the cloud dome. Then have a walk through the walkways by the bay in the late afternoon.",,
,,Beautiful gardens,4,,Both the domes in garden by the bay are beautiful. And I was luck to see the tulips in flower dome. They were absolutely mesmerizing. Cloud forest was also nice,,
,,OMG,5,,"The most amazing area to spend a half day. Wander through the gardens, marvel at the giant trees ( which you will want to see again at night) and then get out of the heat and visit the cloud and flower domes. You will see an indoor waterfall , amazing displays of plants from all over the world.",,
,,Excellent concept and implementation,5,,"Singapore does not have much natural resources but creativity and innovation are evident in these two places.

Flower dome is an air-conditioned flower display from all over the world and we were fortunate that there was a tulip festival ongoing there

Cloud Forest is both a magnificent form of engineering and the creation of a forest in the middle of the city was fantastic",,
,,Must see ....,5,,it is nice place to visit in evering to enjoy light effect & freshness .you can combined this place with Merlion .,,
,,Wonderful day out,5,,"Purchased our tickets online in advance as so much easier and cheaper. Spent a while getting into the gardens from the Marina Bay Sands hotel but really worthwhile. Will need a second visit to do justice to it all. Maybe more fun for adults than children, though.",,
,,Amazing,5,,"Definitely worth a visit, you could spend the day just taking in the atmosphere and people watching.",,
,,Okay but once is enough,4,,First time visiting this attraction. Yes it is so touristy. It was a good experience but not too sure to come back again. The crowd is absolutely the reason.,,
,,"Beautiful gardens, intriguing light show, and impressive diversity of flora",5,,"Spent a lovely evening here our 1st day in Singapore. Most of this complex/park is free (including the light show), but the two paid exhibits are well worth the ticket. Appreciated some of the educational aspects of the cloud dome on climate change and eco conservation. The entire place was absolutely gorgeous.

Get to the light show area (under the giant trees) early-ish to get a nice watching spot for the 10-min digital light show set to symphony music. Loved it!",,
,,See the Mother Earth,5,,"Another gem from Singapore. Gardens by the bay captures everything from planet earth nature. Although, all the places within this destination are great to experience but The best ones are cloud forest and light n sound show.
I would recommend you to experience it more and click photos less",,
,,Aweosme place and beautiful views,5,,"First thing we found difficult is finding the way in. Head or the marina bay sands hotel and there's a lift along from the entrance that takes you up to the level of the hotel which you can just walk straight out and your in gardens by the bay. I'd advise going at night for the beautiful night views. However we went for the day and still had a great time. They have 2 biomes which we didn't go in as they seemed very similar to the Eden project and we were on a budget so we just paid the 8 dollars each to do the walk between the trees. Was a stunning view and we enjoyed it. Lots of free things to see as well so it can be done completely on a budget.

If you don't do gardens by the bay you haven't been to Singapore",,
,,Night Time Visit is a Must,5,,"We have been to the Gardens during the day a couple times, but a visit at night is also a must. At around 7:45 and 8:45 there are musical and light shows in the super tree area. It is fantastic and worth the crowds. You will find many people sitting on the floor or even lying down to get a good view of the tops of the trees. When it is over the crowds disperse back to coaches, cars and taxis, so it can take some time to get out. But all of it worth the experience.",,
,,The best indoor garden in Asia.,5,,"Must visit place if you come to Singapore. The best indoor garden. Well maintained garden, nice ambience and environment. Has some lovely and quiet spots where you can seat and enjoy the scent of flowers, music and cool air (in the domes). Try the dragonfly path, less crowded and has some great views of the Marina bay sands. Clean restrooms, well organized place. Have some good coffee shops and restaurants but pricey. Light show every evening from 7pm, don't miss it!",,
,,Much better by night,4,,"The gardens are much better by night with the light and music show in the man made tree grove and the plants lit up , the gardens during the day are rather bland not much colour mainly tropical unless you pay $28 to view the glass domes which have more variety and they change out special plant displays at the moment it is tulips There are a lot of sculptures around the grounds though",,
,,A MUST if you visit Singapore,5,,"Just beautiful and renewing! Lush, wondrous, alive. The Flower Dome and Cloud Garden Dome are nice cool havens with thousands upon thousands of plants. Have to see it. I just posted a rating on it with more specifics.",,
,,Underbelieve place,5,,"Just wonderful place , more flowers trees , heaps of information.just love very minute there . Easy to get around the Flower dome",,
,,Heaven on Earth,5,,Wow... Amazing Place and The A/c Dome was awesome... Season time makes it look amazing... Must visit place in Singapore,,

,,Dusk is best,4,,"Great attraction even if gardens are not your thing. Singapore can be a beast so I recommend visiting right before dusk, if you're lucky you will experience a nice sunset followed by great view at night with all the lights.",,
,,Cool and beautiful,5,,Amazing experience. A trip around the plant world with a surprise at every corner. Allow plenty of time to see this plant extravaganza,,
,,Flowery rendezvous,3,,"Flower n fauna enthusiasts will surely have a blast here
Flowers from different parts of the world grow in controlled climatic conditions
South African forest, Brazilian rain forest,etc
Themes arranged amongst the flowers for perfect group and selfie photos
The flowers emanate a smell which too few maybe pleasant others may get nauseous
Would have loved a little description just by the side
The dome is beautifully arranged ,flowers are pretty ,bright ,vivacious and dazzling colours hold your eye
The flower dome ,cloud forest ,moonlight adventure and marina bay shoppes and walk along marina bay can be completed in a single evening if you can reach by 4.30 pm
Catch an mrt or bus transport ,it's convenient and fast
The kids do get bored after a while ,so there's an ice cream shop outside ,try the salted caramel ,red velvet flavours
Souvenir shop after coming outside",,
,,Beautiful lights at night,5,,We visited at night only and walked among all the trees. It was beautifully lit up and quite a pleasant stroll after dinner. We missed the elevated walk because we got there too late. Something for the future. Definitely a must see while in Singapore.,,
,,Must visit,5,,What a beautiful place. This is a must place to visit when in Singapore. So nice and relaxing place with air-conditioning in side the flowers houses.,,
,,Breathtaking,5,,The gardens by the bay are really something. It鈥檚 a must for who visits Singapore and for Marina Bay Sands guests practically next door,,
,,Garden By the Bay,3,,They are so excited during the annual trip. They are hope to have an organize again by next year... We try of our best to serve with the trip and be... perfect for the trip..,,
,,Unique experience,5,,"This is a must do trip when visiting Singapore, you will not find anything else like it anywhere else. It's actually free to wander around BUT you need to pay to visit the Flower Dome and the Cloud Dome plus the OCBC skyway if you are short of cash give the skyway a miss but the other two are fantastic.",,
,,Beautiful and unique,4,,"The gardens are beautiful during the day but are magical at night lit up. It is a lot of walking, but seeing this unique site both in daylight and at nighttime is worth it.",,
,,Must do,4,,Absolutely brilliant 3 hrs. Loved the light show at night. Didn鈥檛 get to the kids playground or water playground but looked good.,,
,,Stunning day out,5,,"Great place well worth a visit, fabulous plants and great gardens. Amazing views from the walkways. Nice and cool inside.",,
,,Absolute beauty,5,,"The two conservatories, flower dome and cloud forest are breathtakingly beautiful. Gardens display plantation from multiple countries and we were lucky enough to make tulipmania. The indoor waterfall will amaze you. This is the pay entry but you can walk around outside they have some gardens to see. The light shows at night are free and are another spectacular feature that cannot be missed if in Singopore",,
,,"Dazzling, but a bit Tacky",4,,"Finally had a chance to drop by Gardens by the Bay. This is part fabulous and unique garden environment and part tacky tourist tat - a difficult pairing! It is certainly worth a visit to experience the habitat gardens from all corners of the world and for the landscaping. This enjoyment is off-set by the tacky tourist lights and ""art"" and the swarms of selfie tourists. The Botanic Gardens thankfully remains void of all this nonsense. Worth a trip, but avoid the crowds!",,
,,An absolute must see Garden,5,,"Loved the gardens & thrilled for only $8 to walk the Skyway. Magic views from high on Supertree Grove, beautiful green plants 馃尡 affirming the metal structures. I returned at Night & thoroughly enjoyed Symphony Light Show - magic by the river",,
,,Great,4,,Nicely planned but all roads lead to a gift shop!! A work in progress. Easy to get to and will be wonderful when it has matured. I personally preferred the older Botanical gardens.,,
,,Amazing Garden,5,,"You will not be disappointed to go to Garden by the bays. In fact, I like it so much that I went there twice already. The best time to go is around 5pm, then after you visited all dorms inside, it's almost 7- 8pm. Then you can come out to enjoy the amazing night view. It's like you went inside a movie.",,
,,A must do,5,,Gardens by the Bay is on everyone鈥檚 list when visiting Singapore and you won鈥檛 be disappointed. Try to go early as it gets very hot and crowded. We had a great day out.,,
,,Loved the 2 domes,5,,"We loved the 2 domes, I'm just blown away by the technology and inspiration that went into their creation. So much to see and take in. We didn't CDC stay for the evening light show because of the public holiday crowds but it was still a fantastic afternoon.",,
,,Amazing gardens,5,,"This was the highlight of our 3 days in Singapore. Wonderful gardens. Two fantastic domes, don't miss the mountain dome with indoor waterfall, spectacular. The gardens are free, but you have to pay for the domes. Well worth it. Went back in the evening for the free light show. A not to be missed spectacle.",,
,,No 1 place to visit,5,,"Wonderfull place. You must visit it in the evening when they arrange the light & music show sometimes between half past seven and eight. Totally amazing!! Large area with two specific gardens to visit, the flower dome and the cloud forest. Visit both. Flower dome is filled with flowers from all over the world. Cloud forest is like a mountain with a waterfall and you will take a elevator up to the elevated walkway. Don't forget to bring your camera. Marina sands bay hotel is closed to this garden and could also be worht a visit.",,
,,Magnificient,5,,Lovely awesome acquired knowledge of sooo many creations of our Lord .thankful n blessed to see it with my family.,,
,,Enjoyable futuristic gardens,5,,The gardens were very big with lots to see. The light show at the giant flowers was exceptional. The water play area was ideal for kids. We had a great time without paying to go in the domes or the skywalk.,,

,,great time here,5,,spent half a day exploring the area. tickets price is reasonable and the best part is that the domes have airconditioning. Really close to bayfront mrt station and is only 2 stops from the hotel nuve in bugis.,,
,,Worth visiting,4,,Gardens by the bay was very beautiful and large area with lot's to see. We didn't pay for the special gardens. You should go there in the evening time when it's dark and see the magic three light show! It was super.,,
,,Excellent,5,,This is a great way to spend a few hours. The water play area for younger kids is amazing!!! I just wish there was a place to get a decent coffee!,,
,,Never give a miss,5,,"Such a amazing indoor garden , worth a watch, but you need to walk a lot in these places. If you have small children please carry strollers.",,
,,You got to do it when In Singapore.,5,,"On a hot steamy day there is absolutely nothing more fabulous than stepping into the cool, fragrant Cloud Forest, and then at night, watch the Super Tree light and music show, followed by a bite at Satay By the Bay. If you have time and kids, be sure to take them to the waterpark with the sprinklers. This entire area is entertaining and shouldn't be missed on a trip to Singapore.",,
,,A-MAZ-ING and FREE. Two words every traveller wants to hear.,5,,"In 2014 we visited Gardens By The Bay by day and when we adjusted to the heat we loved the variety of the plants we were seeing. In 2018 we visited at night. The taxi driver knew exactly where to drop us off, we headed for THE trees found a place to sit under them and waited. It was worth it. What a spectacle of color and light and music. The next stop was the light show on the other side of Marina Bay Sands. No need to rush though, there are two shows of each.",,
,,Help Save Mother Earth,5,,Such a very nice place promoting to save our motherland by conserving energy and planting more plants.Though I traveled alone it was such an amazing trip discovering this place.Was able to see Tulipmania.. and got wobbly knees in Cloud forest,,
,,Beautiful,4,,"A beautiful oasis in a huge city. A great place to visit to embrace nature. Educational as well. It is well laid out with indoor a/c areas out of the heat as well as some outdoor areas. Even when you are indoors you feel like you鈥檙e outdoors many different plants and flowers all with labels. You can go on a guided tour or self guided. There are several different options and price points depending what you want to see and how much time you have. Several places to buy a quick snack and a more formal sit down restaurant.

,,Beautiful. Don't miss the Sound and Light Show,5,,You simply cannot miss the sound and light show of you are here in Singapore. It is done daily at 07:45pm.,,
,,Breath taking,5,,This is an amazing place to see the icon of Singapore. The light show is simply beautiful. Great place to spend the day with friends or family.,,
,,Sensational Garden,5,,We turned up the night before at 8-30 not realising that ticketing closes at 8 and conservatories at 9. Returned next morning. The Flower conservatory was spectacular - particularly the tulip display and the wood sculptures throughout. The Cloud conservatory was also very good with creative displays around an internal mountain. More creative than Butchart Gardens but I thought flower range more diverse with more tropical offerings. A must do experience in Singapore.,,
,,Amazingly good!!!,5,,One of the major attractions of Singapore.The place is amazing beautiful with some wonderful concepts of nature!!!,,
,,"What a light display, to rival any around the world",5,,"An amazing attraction. We mNaged to time it perfectly, getting up to the skywalk at about 7.30pm so we had the light show from among the trees and then came down to the ground for the ending. Very very cheap but a memory for life",,
,,Awesome at night (lights),4,,"Be sure to attend one of 2 free shows with lights synchronized to music at night.
Go a bit early as it's a way from MRT to get a seat near the base of the lights.It goes quickly but is worthwhile to see pus the ferris wheel and city by night from the bay.",,
,,Woouuuuu,5,,Its Really worth a visit. We truely enjoyed our evening Here and We Will come back next time. Be there in time and fond a Nice spot for Watching,,
,,Garden of dreams,5,,"Multiple places to visit.
Flower Dome, Cloud Forest and OCBC Sky Walk are a must-see. Excellent running/jogging/walking path.
Very friendly staff support.
I highly recommend that your visit timing starts at around 5pm as u will get to see the beauty at natural light and be amazed of it鈥檚 transformation when night falls.
Easily accessible via MRT (Bayfront station).",,
,,Excellent gardens .,5,,Free garden areas are set in large garden areas. Flower dome presents different flower displays during various times of the year. The cloud forest dome is outstanding with a tall waterfall amid sky high walkways. This is one attraction not to be missed.,,
,,Beautiful,4,,"Worth a visit, stunning gardens and great view of Marina Bay Sands hotel. Must take water if not day, lots of walking.",,
,,Spectacular!,5,,A must for travellers to Singapore. The tree structures come alive as the sun goes down. The colours are amazing and the whole area is incredibly beautiful. It really is indescribable. The highlight of my trip to Singapore!,,
,,Awesome,5,,We paid to visit the main attractions but it a lovely place to walk round and relax in even if you don't go up in the supergrove trees or the domes. So much bigger than I expected with shops for food and ice creams available. Great views of marina Bay sands Hotel as well. Great accessibility for wheelchairs and push chairs.,,
,,Amazing experience in Singapore,5,,"If you do nothing else in Singapore, visit the amazing Gardens by the Bay! Not only are the gardens spectacularly beautiful but the conservatories are architectural wonders and the Grove of Giant Trees a masterpiece of enviromental technology.

The gardens showcase Singapore's natural and colonial history. There are plants from every region of the world except Antarctica. Plenty of places to eat to suit different budgets. Amazing staff and volunteers.

Something for everyone? Indeed.

The children's garden is delightful and includes a fun water feature and play under fountains is encouraged. Ramps and meticulously maintained paths make the going easy for aged or disabled people, as well as for parks.

I wish I could find enough superlatives to describe the conservatories which provide a cool respite from the outside heat and showcase plants of many varieties in all sorts of settings and configurations.

Truly a must do experience.",,
,,Everything Amazing.,5,,"Whether you're a garden lover or not, this will amaze you. The structure and variety of plants, flowers, trees, simply captivating.",,

,,What a light show,5,,We visited the gardens during the day which is well worth a visit. We returned at night for the light show which was absolutely brilliant we went to the 8:45 show which allowed us to watch the Marina Bay water light show,,
,,Paradise!,5,,This place is magic fell in love with the beauty of the flowers the way they intertwined up the trees was outstanding the beauty of the gardens was breathtaking and the lights were fabulous really showed the full potential of the gardens. Everything was immaculately pruned and the paths were spotlessly clean. The ambience was 10 out of 10 for such a magnificent peaceful what I would call Paradise. Would highly recommend a visit especially at night when it shines brightly.,,
,,View,5,,"Amazing place ... Service crew are the face of a restu or bar . So, it is of utmost necessity that they are dressed in the most appropriate attire and smell good. Shabby, creased or stained uniform could be displeasing to the us diners who are come to the restaurant to enjoy good food in a hygienic eRestaurant business depends a lot of the quality of waiting staff, they are face of a restaurant.

,,Must visit!,5,,It's free to walk around certain areas of the park including the Super Tree Groves. The lights turn on at 7 are fantastic and you can enjoy light shows after that!,,
,,Must See in Singapore,5,,"An absolute must when visiting Singapore! My friend and I strolled the gardens at night and it was beautiful to see everything lit up and glowing in the evening!
However to see the orchid garden and the cloud forest you must visit during the day and so both of us went back for seconds early the next morning. Gardens by the Bay has so much to view and explore so definitely allow yourself ample time for this attraction!",,
,,Beauty with Science,4,,In my view Its the most beautiful place in singapore. After a moist hot weather of singapore these gardens are source of refreshness. Lots of botanical excellence in one place .Although a bit costly but is worth,,
,,Modern green,5,,"Very well designed, quiet and beautiful, very helpful staff, easy to access Superbly maintained. Must visit",,

,,Amazing and great place to experience!!,5,,We visited on a Saturday evening at 5pm and it was extremely busy. The flowers and venues were beautiful. It was tulip time while we there and it was just gorgeous!! A lot of work goes into this place to keep it so amazing!! We waited to do the light show later in the evening and paid the extra money to walk above the trees to experience it. It is a MUST do when in Singapore and well worth going.,,
,,Visit at night for free,5,,"There are public places that can be visited until 2am for free.

It can be hot during the day, and if youre not planning of visiting the enclosed ""gardens"" this is the best alternative.

Take lots of photos. I suggest that you visit this place from Merlion Park, a 30-min easy walk. You will also passby the Helix bridge so it will be worth it.",,
,,Prepare to be amazed!,5,,"Having seen Gardens by the Bay under construction several years ago, we could not wait to see the completed project. This is the only tropical garden in the world that you go into the glass houses to experience a cool temperate climate. Be sure to go back at night for the light show! The Garden can easily take all day to see.",,
,,Pretty amazing for an Artificial 'Garden',4,,"As a lover of nature and of experiencing nature in a 'natural setting', this did not touch my heart. In fact it was kinda weird. Having said that, I must say I was very impressed by what Singapore had done with the little they have. The fact that a this entire man-made structure was made and that it houses so many exotic plants is simply Amazing!! But once again.... I'd rather see these in their natural setting. Also it was too crowded to enjoy anything. But overall its good to visit.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"Very Well organised, very crowded & beautiful, Plan to visit again. Wondering there must have a lot of specialist maintaining the garden.",,
,,City inside the Garden,5,,"This is such an awesome place and one of a kind..Basically, Singapore city is inside the garden and not garden inside the city..
Light show is the cherry on top..
It's free to visit the garden but not the dome..
Do not miss this place in Singapore..",,
,,Nice outing,5,,I personally love Tulips very much. This trip consists of my family of 4 and my parents. Loved the aroma of the tulips when we stepped in to the Flower Dome. Very worth while and we felt like we were in Holland! Beautiful sight and of course TULIPS!,,
,,Just waoo,5,,Simply Breathtaking. It's a testimony of what we can do with our creativity. A must if you are going to Singapore for the first time. Preferably visit it after dark for the full lit up glory of the place.,,
,,awewome!,5,,"We headed over to Gardens by the Bay after dinner. I had heard some thing about a nightly light show. We took the MRT and just followed the crowds to the Gardens. Sure enough, there was a free show at 8pm so we hung around and enjoyed it. I hope my still pics attached can give you some idea of the light show in motion, set to classical music.",,
,,Fantastic,5,,A very good experience t Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. I am really impressed and enjoy the visit. Check out their event before you planned your trip!,,
,,Unreliable Online Purchase,1,,"I purchased 3 adults tickets online on 24 Apr 2018. To my horror, when I checked my credit card transactions, I was charged twice the amount!",,
,,An eye opening experience,5,,Came here for Tulipmania. It was beautiful! Stayed until the night for the night view and show. It was awesome. A must visit place if you happen to be in Singapore. Totally worth the price!,,
,,Fabulous evening,5,,"It is free to visit the gardens, a lovely peaceful experience to wind down after a couple of full on city life! The main attractions here are the huge domes which you do pay for but well worth it. The flower dome stages different exhibits and we saw tulip mania but the huge multi level dome has many permanent features showing gardens around the world. The Cloud Dome is spectacular- a must see. We went late afternoon, early evening in order to visit domes and stay on for the evening light show but so was everyone else! It was crowded and we had to queue for 45 mins.if you have time I recommend doing domes earlier in the day and coming back for the evening light show ( free) another time.
The light show was spectacular. Get there about 20-30 mins before to sit somewhere in the area under the giant trees and you are in for a treat.",,
,,A garden city...,5,,"The place is divided into many sections :
The flower dome
Cloud forest
The supergrove tree and many more.
The glass domes are huge and spectacular. As it was raining I couldn't explore the place much. It's a city full of garden. The super grove tree light show is worth watching.",,
,,A must on the list !,5,,"If you are visiting marina , you need to spend an evening here too ! Day time it鈥檚 hot ! Try going up the artificial tree house ! Impressive engineering feat !",,
,,Huge,5,,Gardens by the bay is very huge and one has to spend at least a day there. It has many attractions within itself.,,
,,Stunning - a must see,5,,"This is a truly stunning place to visit, and ideal for all the family!

A huge landscaped garden which is free to walk around. There are giant super trees, themed gardens from all around the world, large greenhouse type domes to explore (charges apply for entrance to these), statues, wonderful walkways and lakes.

At night the super trees light up and there are two lights shows (free) each evening.

We visited at about 9am (I think the Garden opens much earlier) which meant a nice cool air to walk around in, and not many people about. When we got to the Cloud Dome it was also quite empty with no queues.

We spent half a day here heading back to the Marina Bay shopping mall for lunch, but we returned the same evening to catch the light show.

We would definitely recommend this and suggesting putting it high on your itinerary or 鈥渢o do鈥?list when in Singapore.",,
,,Tulips galore,5,,Good range of tulips in the show. Staff were efficient and helpful. The cloud forest was a special highlight too.,,
,,Not to be misses,5,,"This is something you cannot miss, its truly wonderful, very easy to get too and worth several visits, we would have loved to return but didn't have enough time, but on next return we'll visit again. Not to be missed.",,
,,More FREE stuff in this expensive city!,5,,"Ok to be specific, the outdoor gardens and the children's gardens are free. The skyway and the conservatories aren't. But there is plenty to see at the outdoor gardens such as those big, lit up super trees. Definitely worth a visit if you're trying to watch your spending in that city.",,
,,Very beautiful,5,,"If you love plants and nature , this is a place you should visit for sure !!! We had great time there , at night time is very interesting and beautiful !!! The music and atmosphere is Amazing !!!",,
,,A must visit place for nature lovers,5,,I鈥檓 a frequent to Singapore and this is a place I try to visit in my every visit. This place is truly amazing and any one who comes to Singapore should visit this place. This please relaxes your mind and once you are inside it鈥檚 give a unforgettable experience. Keep up the good work guys. I see improvements day by day.,,
,,Interesting and Unique Place to Visit!,4,,This is a great place for those who love plants and flowers. Many interesting and different types of beautiful and exotic plants and flowers can be found there. Worth spending some time at the flower domes and supertree grove.,,
,,Magic place,5,,"The night music show is just so beautiful, but take a chair or something to sit on as it is tiring to stand around and watch if you are waiting for awhile.",,
,,Flower & cloud domes,5,,"Absolutely fantastic show, the tulips were beautiful.
The first exhibit in the flower dome is.... you guessed it, Australia!!!
The cloud was amazing, & the sky walk excellent.
We only dis the daytime, so next time we visit Singapore we will be sure to do the evening, when it is all lit up.
Everyone needs to go there.
The Best",,
,,Wonderful place,5,,"Place where you need definitely to visit during Singapore stay, at 7:45 and 8:45 wonderful and amazing light show, very recomended!",,
,,Very nice place,5,,"We were really glad we visitwd - flower dome, cliud forest done and music and light show -all was really nice.",,
,,Cloud Nine at Cloud Dome,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is quite extraordinary.
The size and sheer ambition- even audacity- of this project is jaw dropping.
We visited Gardens by the Bay including Cloud Dome, Flower Dome and the Supertrees as part of a stay in Singapore.
Cloud Dome was spectacular with its sizeable waterfall tumbling down from the top, and periodic misting of plants within the enormous covered structure.
I must admit that heights are not my thing so the ascension to the top of the Cloud Dome did not come without reservation.
Yet every minute I was ok-ing and ahh-ing over delicious plants and foliage thinking that I must rush home and plant begonias, fuschias and philodendrons everywhere.
The Lego installation was somewhat kitsch but undoubtably won the hearts of many young visitors.
The second Dome, the Flower Dome seemed quite a lot larger than the Cloud Dome though not as tall. There was a tulip show on display when we visited with many addidtional coloured props showcasing the blooms- and this appealed to many people though not me ( I鈥檓 not one for tschotke- filled landscapes).
The highlight of the Flower Dome was without doubt the succulent collection which was extensive.
The Supertrees are an architectural marvel and the size is quite extraordinary although the planting has really not been so successful... these look quite parched and somewhat unhappy. Instead the planting
If you don鈥檛 mind heights then the bridge between the Supertrees may appeal (ticketed entry) and whilst my intrepid husband eagerly queued, alas it was not for me.
The plantings around the Supertrees installation was very lush and appealing.
If you have any interest in gardens, flowers, nature then you simply must go. This is an extraordinary achievement and well worth the visit.
Big tip: arrive by 9am to avoid the crowds and enjoy the gardens with a far smaller crowd. Prebook your ticket online if possible.",,
,,Visit to Gardens by the Bay,4,,"Yes, it is a perfect place for family outing. My mum really enjoy the beauty of those flowers and surrounding. It is fascinating and we are full of surprised of so many types of flowers and plants that the Gardens exhibits. We will continue to visit whenever there are different plants and flowers are presented. Thank you Gardens by the Bay",,
,,Jungle,5,,"Amazing view went we go travel, If you come to Singapore. Must to go at here and go around to feel Singapore vibes",,
,,Fantastic,5,,"The gardens as a whole are great with free access but the domes are even a step up from that, although relatively expensive.",,
,,Amazing must see highlight,5,,"The two dome gardens are really stunning, and refreshingly cool (temperature) to visit, and well worth the entry price. We started early and successfully avoided the crowds and coach tour groups. It鈥檚 then free to walk around the gardens outside and under the amazing Supertree grove - dramatic sculptures you can pay to walk up into.",,
,,Best in Singapore!,5,,"At first I wonder why people are excited to visit here. A place inhabited by select plants while the whole of Southeast Asia is covered by rainforest and tropical climate. But once you're here, you'll just say endless admiration for its beauty and technological advancement. The most interesting place to visit.",,
,,Must visit,5,,"Beautiful place!!! We visited gardens by the bay and loved it, really nice place bit busy but it鈥檚 worth it.",,
,,Cool to See But Touristy,4,,"This is a must see when visiting Singapore, which of course makes it extremely touristy. There are crowds of people here and expensive ticket prices to enter different areas, but is still worth walking the grounds (even if you don't pay to go into anything).",,
,,Traveling with teens,5,,You would think that this place would not be for teenage boys. They absolutely loved it. They wanted to come back but we run out the time. It is just heavenly place to visit and relax your soul and mind,,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,"Amazing....well worth a visit for any age group. Not to be missed. Plants from many areas of the world all under a huge domed roof...trees, flowers succulents, shrubs in a micro climate",,
,,Getting a new experience by a awesome sceneries.,4,,Very memorable Entertaining in our life. Very nice place to take Photos and make albums. Very attractive place for children and young couples.,,
,,fantastic,5,,great experience in the wonderful city of Singapore. Trees are beautiful and the light show set to music was great.,,
,,A must.,5,,"No questions, if you go to Singapore you must go here. Just amazing, the architecture, the vegetation, the views. Just amazing.",,
,,Wonderful light n sound show. Also saw lots of variety of tulips,4,,A must visit in Singapore . Indoor dome r air conditioned so spend day time inside it. Flower festivals are always going. Need to walk a lot. It can be visited with family and friends. Waterfall is very high. A must visit,,
,,Evening visit,5,,"Excellent place to go for everyone. Great light shows at 7.45pm & 8.45pm . Themed music that lights in trees dance to . Plenty of places to eat , very clean MRT station close by at marina sands mall. A must place to visit",,
,,Evening visit,5,,Amazing place. A 鈥榤ust see鈥?for anyone visiting Singapore. We went for the 7.45 sound and light show. Stunning. As it was the 4th May they had 鈥楽tar Wars 鈥?as the music. The light show was truly amazing. Spotlessly clean. Beautiful place in the middle of Singapore city. Easy to get there MRT station very close.,,
,,One of its kind!,5,,We love the AC in the domes in hot humid weather of singapore! Inside it's like a fairytale wonderland. It can be crowded.,,
,,The perfect 鈥極nly one day in S鈥檖ore鈥?place to see,5,,"I can only agree with every other review that this place is a must see for every Singapore visitor. Words don鈥檛 describe it, just check out the photos. Even my blokey Aussie hubby loved it.",,
,,"Nice, but a little overrated",3,,"Perhaps we were spoiled by the more secluded Singapore Botanic Gardens the day before, but I found Gardens by the Bay to be a little too touristy for my taste. Don't get me wrong; it was very nice and worth visiting, but the hype is a bit much for what you get. My advice is to go ahead and do this, but also see the Singapore Botanic Gardens and, if you can, hike to the ""Tree Top Walk"" (monkeys!) for a truly incredible Singapore experience.",,
,,Beautiful Place for a stroll on a cloudy day,5,,Best explored when its slightly overcast as you benefit from the shade. Watch-Out if you suffer from vertigo or fear of heights! :),,
,,Stunning in parts,4,,"expansive, but perhaps too large for a visit on a hot and humid day. The first 'cooled' glasshouses (Flower Dome and Cloud Forest) I have visited - they are absolutely spectacular if a little crowded. Good choice of places to eat and rest ones feet, absolutely essential!",,
,,Very impressive and enjoyable,5,,Could not believe the total beauty of the flower Dome especially the tulips they are beyond words with their colour,,
,,Amazing Gardens,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is a 'must do' when in Singapore. There are so many things to see and do. The Cloud Forest and Flower Domes are fabulous and, as both are air-conditioned, they're also a great oasis out of the heat of the day. The OCBC Walkway is nice, but will be amazing in 10 years time, when the towers are covered in plants (they're only 50% covered now).",,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,"A must see for any trip to Singapore, make sure you're inside when the misting starts. The gardens outside are alos very impressive",,
,,Very nice illuminated by night,5,,"Admission tickets are for the domes, but the park outside its free. I totally recommend a walk through it by night since the trees are beautifully lit. It's much more nicer than going there during the day.",,
,,Night light show was excellent!,5,,"We stayed across the street from the gardens at the Marina Bay Sands hotel and had an amazing view from our balcony. We could see the light show every night from our balcony. We went to the gardens and also witnessed the light show in the gardens. There are two shows every night, I believe it鈥檚 6:30pm & 8:30pm. The show lasts exactly 15 min. and always starts on time! The lights change color to music playing, it is quite amazing to see, I def. recommend. Easy to to at the end of your day, or before dinner at night. It is free to enter.",,
,,Hot but worth it,5,,Was a great place to visit the domes are amazing and the sculptures are unbelievable you don't realise their size until you stand at the foot on one so worth the visit,,
,,Stunning!,5,,Totally a must! Easy to access by public transport or taxis are quite reasonable here. It鈥檚 just magical !,,
,,Astonishing,5,,"One of the very top attractions of Singapore, 10 minutes from the city center. World heritage in the making.",,
,,AWE INSPIRING ESP BY NIGHT,5,,"The tree structures are amazing. They incorporate solar power, water catchment and use these to create a fantastic light show in the evening and to irrigate the plants in the gardens. Stunning . a must see attraction.",,
,,Excellent Night View,5,,"Spectacular night view, it is a must visit place during the night times (7.00 pm to 8.30 pm) for all visitors to Singapore, the light and music show will start at 7.45 pm and ends at 8.00 pm. you can take nice pictures.",,
,,"Get there early in the morning, simply stunning!!!",5,,"These gardens and Domes are so impressive. But make sure you get up early and beat the crowds. I was in the Gardens early which are free and always open, it was quiet, peaceful, and it's not as humid. Then I was at the Cloud Forest Dome, the one with the waterfall when it opened at 9am, no crowd at all, and so cool. When I left around 11am I could see the place was starting to get very crowded.",,
,,OVERPRICED AND OVERCROWDED,3,,"Too busy for me. We waited in line for nearly an hour just to get into the waterfall dome so by the time we finished there we couldn鈥檛 be bothered doing the flower dome because it was just as busy.
Best thing is just walk around the outdoor gardens.",,
,,Nice escape from Singapore鈥檚 heat,5,,"The cooled conservatories were both great and relaxing. The Cloud Forest has a waterfalls and an orchid exhibit that we liked. For those who are afraid of heights, you may want to skip the elevated walkways.
During our visit, the Flower Dome has an on-going exhibit: Tulip Festival. The Cherry blossom festival has just ended. There鈥檚 always something new here so your last visit will not be the same.",,
,,gardens by the bay,5,,we had great time the displays were really good very easy to get around both domes and the light show was great place to visit,,
,,It is so much better and more than what you can see in a photo.,5,,This was a wonderful place to visit. Very beautiful blend of architecture and landscape. Amazing displays and lighting. It is so much better and more than what you can see in a photo.,,
,,DON'T MISS IT!,5,,"We opted not to go inside the Cloud Forest or the Flower dome as it was so hot outside anyway. Friends of ours visited both domes and said they were worth a visit. We just wandered through the lovely gardens and went on the skywalk between the Super Trees. Warning - it you don't like heights, this is not a good idea. However, we persevered knowing it was worth it. Metro has a stop here but it was a bit of a walk in the heat. Singapore is a few degrees north of the equator so what can you expect!",,
,,Spectacular but a maze,4,,"Of course this is a must see whilst on Singapore, but it is a bit of a warren to find your way around The gardens are a delight and very well kept, and the two glasshouses contain some wonderful plantings.",,
,,Cool and refreshing Garden,5,,"The outside gardens with the steel trees are already amazing but wait until you go into the exhibition! They have a waterfall indoors and the coolness is overwhelming! Butterfly garden is OK, but once is enough. After the Gardens on the bay go to the Marina Bay Sands and have a cocktail at the roof! Amazing view over the city!",,
,,Superb,5,,"I loved my visit to the Gardens by the Bay. What a fantastic area, so beautifully kept and so well signposted. This area has different gardens and lakes and also the 鈥榯rees鈥?that light up and the walkway linking them (you pay to go on the walkway but it鈥檚 worth it). These trees look fantastic up close but even more magical when they are lit up at night.
There are plenty of places to eat and drink here, all reasonably priced and the area is close to an MRT station and also to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome.
I would urge you to visit if you鈥檙e in Singapore. There are some really wonderful photo opportunities too.",,
,,Love the cloud garden dome,5,,Separate tickets are required for each dome and the tree top walk. The tulip display currently in the flower dome was beautiful. Well worth the visit,,
,,Fantastic attraction,5,,Came here for a lovely afternoon/evening and amazed at the huge range of plants . Well organised and just was in awe of the work that has gone in to this .,,
,,Surreal experience,5,,It was one of the high points of our trip. It seemed very fairytale-esque and unreal. There are two glass greenhouses which are humongous. One is the cloud forest and the other is the flower dome. The effort to bring people closer to nature is definitely successful. There are some super trees which have entry charges.,,
,,Short visit,4,,"Sound and light show was amazing. Unofortunately, I was not able to go up the gint tree as it was closed by the time I reached. Perfect spot to chill out and hang with your friends.",,
,,GREAT TO VISIT DAY OR NIGHT,5,,"A great place to visit during the day and a MUST at night to see the fantastic light show, so much to see and do. They have a shuttle that you can take.",,
,,Special gardens by the bay,5,,"Came here as part of my birthday celebrations,went in cloud and flower dome and around the grounds very beautiful and relaxing",,
,,Impressive,5,,Just loved gardens by the bay. The Japanese gardens were amazing with adult flowering plums brought in from Europe and japan. Surprised how cold it was in there though so suggest a jacket.,,
,,There's heart in this flora,5,,"The most amazing part in Gardens by the Bay is the maintenance of each and every sapling and plant. Lot of effort and heart is put into every blade of grass that makes every plant look healthy and beautiful reflecting the effort taken by the caretaker. A wonderful place to cool you and every person of any age loves it.
Its obviously a treat for nature lovers and those studying botany.
A must see.",,
,,Another must see in Singapore,5,,"The most current GREEN building and for a small price, you can utilize the tram system to get around. Stay for the evening light show and enjoy great food around the park.",,
,,Must see,4,,"If coming to Singapore dont miss this spectacular display of the trees and flowers.Artistically done and well maintained.Purchase the tickects from klook.com for cheaper tickets,dont miss the lights show at 7.45 and 8.45 ,its a amazing experience",,
,,Spectacular,4,,Pretty impressive especially the indoor waterfall Both domes are interesting and worth a visit But the waterfall is a must,,
,,Indeed a Great scenery!,5,,The place is just breath taking! Plants and colorful flowers are everywhere! It is very amazing walk by the gardens watching those beautiful scenery surrounding you. Its a place to definitely visit.,,
,,Enlightening experience,5,,The Gardens at the Bay is a must for any Singapore tourist. The magnitude of flowers and the ambience is superb. The restaurant is also lovely with a variety of meals to choose from. I learn鈥檛 so much about fuana and flora during my visit.,,
,,A lovely one day adventure that could easily become a two day adventure,5,,The garden were a 5 minute ride on the SMRT from where we were staying. The sense of serenity and the amazing planning and attention to detail in an ever changing vista of visual relaxation and pleasure.,,
,,Amazing,5,,"Visited during the day and looked round the gardens which are just stunning. The dragonfly walk is lovely and we saw a huge lizard hiding under the plants but he was too fast for us to take a photo! We were also lucky enough to spot some otters, they were near the bank of the river and HUGE! Luckily there were a couple of staff around who said dont get too close as they will chase you and how lucky we were to see such a huge group of them together (even he was taking photos!). They were happy taking baths in the sand while we took photos. We returned at evening time to watch the Supertree light show which was fantastic. For a totally free day out this place is brilliant for all ages, plenty of places to sit and take a break from the heat. If you only do one thing in Singapore...do this!",,
,,Beautiful,4,,"Very beautiful. We did not like that much the hidden garden we found it overpriced. We much preferred the flower dome.
You can walk in the garden for free and this is already amazingly nice.
The lights at night are amazing and definitely worth watching the lighting flower musical show at 8pm",,
,,Free entertainment and good food at good prices,5,,"Stop by for the free light show at 7:30 & 8:30, you will not be disappointed. There are several restaurants there with a variety of food styles and some great deals.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay - Singapore,5,,"If you are at all interested in gardens then this is a ""must"" to visit. Beautiful displays, well presented and with air conditioning it is comfortable to walk around.",,
,,Gardens by the bay,5,,This is well worth a visit it has a relaxing feel to it and in the evening there is a splendid laser light show. I would definitely recommend anyone to visit these lovely gardens.,,
,,Awesome at night,5,,"Even if you've already been here during the day it is worth another visit in the evening for the lightshow. Loved the cloud forest, the whole place is just on another scale entirely.",,
,,Marvellous architecture,5,,"A beautiful place to spend a day. the gardens have many aspects, flowers, forest, water sculpture and of course the super trees and the two eco buildings. A must for anyone visiting here.",,
,,wow,5,,"wow, amazing ,fantastic,unbelievable are just some of the words that come to mind when you visit this place would love to have stayed there much longer would go back to singapore just to see it again",,
,,Very impressive !!,5,,"We visited the gardens late afternoon so we could stay for the 7:45pm light show. We purchased tickets for the 2 domes which are very impressive , the flower dome had a special display of tulips which were full of multiple colors & the first dome was totally incredible. The huge waterfall as soon as you enter takes your breath away. The light & sound show in the open area is very impressive too and keeps you engaged the entire time. Not to miss when in Singapore",,
,,Beautiful gardens,5,,The gardens are done by countries and themes and are beautifully maintained. We were there for the tulip festival and it was done incredibly well. Look for discount tickets online,,
,,Amazing,5,,"If visiting Singapore do not miss this!!
The walk high up in the trees gives fabulous views of the city and Sand Bay Hotel. Both domes are full of flowers and interesting information about preserving our planet.
Beautiful gardens to explore, lots of eating places and spotlessly clean !!",,
,,Beautiful place a must see,5,,I would highly recommend visit the gardens when in Singapore it鈥檚 a credit to this beautiful city . The dome was filled with vibrant colours of flowers from all over the world when we visited they had tulips they were beautiful we had a tour that explain all about the park and how it started and the good things they are doing for the environment this place was amazing . I鈥檓 not big on gardens and wouldn鈥檛 usually visit something like this bug glad we did.,,
,,Amazing,5,,"What an amazing and beautifully tended place. The gardens are immense but don鈥檛 feel overwhelming because they are well zoned. The two domes, the Flowe Dome and the Cloud Forest Dome gave a welcome break from the heat as well as being some of the most fascinating places I鈥檝e ever visited - they can be visited just for their beauty or for their educational value - well worth the entry fee. The 鈥榓mazing trees鈥?(giant artificial trees) are really beautiful - I鈥檇 seen pictures of them and thought they鈥檇 be good but the reality was even better. It was only the heat that finally sent us back to our hotel for a rest. A definite for a repeat visit when/if next in Singapore.",,
,,"Loved it here, I really want to go again",5,,"We went to the light show session which was AUD$8 I think from memory and it was well worth it. We also had dinner and drinks at the roof bar (delicious), staff friendly and efficient, not to mention the absolutely awesome view. A must to do. Easy to get a taxi to. Relax and enjoy..",,
,,Superb place,4,,I loved the different types of seasons they over it鈥檚 my second time and I was not board as it was completely different to my 1st my kids loved the walk through the gardens room to run about but the que to wait to go up the lift was over 2 hours so take some water and some thing to much on or go in a group of friends,,
,,Beautiful flowers,4,,Went here and was amazed by the quantity/quality and variety of flowers growing here. Lovely place to spend some time.,,
,,Well worth it,5,,We decided to go do the cloud dome after having been on a walking tour. By the time we had reached the domes we discovered we could only pay for two domes. We were exhausted from our earlier tour and was not sure we had the energy. We were so glad we did go in. We started with the cloud dome which was incredible and after enjoying it so much decided to have a coffee break and Do the flower dome. This was so different from the first one but incredible also. My husband and decided they were the best things we had done in Singapore in our 8 day visit. Everyone should put them on your list.,,
,,Amazing gardens,5,,"Main gardens are pleasant, the two domes are very interesting, and the evening light show was great.",,
,,Fantastic facility.,5,,"Hot and sticky, but worth the effort to view wonderful architecture and plant life. Disappointed that they do not offer senior reductions to anyone other than local residents. We used one of the restaurants for a light lunch. It was good and represented value for money. Well worth a visit.",,
,,Pricey but pretty and interesting,4,,"THE cost is about 25 Singapore dollar for both domes and if you want to go up to one of the trees near the domes it's 20 SGD for the terrace and 8 SGD for the other platform. The domes themselves are very pretty but it's very packed with people. If you're in Singapore, it's worth it to go but the crazy amount of people was a downfall, I wish they had a cap of people that can enter.",,
,,Gorgeous place,5,,"A beautiful leafy escape in a concrete jungle! Free to view gardens, just had to pay for flower dome and cloud forest. The gardens are beautifully kept and there are lots of different trails and information points, interactive areas great for children. Lovely way to spend an afternoon.",,
,,Nice little attraction,4,,"We enjoyed quite a pleasant walk around the park and took quite a few photos. The paid attractions inside the park, however, were ok but not much to write home about. As for the lighting show in the evening, we left after a few minutes as it wasn't spectacular at all. Overall, the park was still worth visiting.",,
,,Really lovely,5,,"Just a short walk from the metro station so very convenient. These gardens are a must see, they are lovely. Make sure you go into the covered sections too. Lots to see and very interesting with some beautiful and wonderful flowers, plants, shrubs and trees, all creatively displayed. There were lots of other visitors but it didn't feel packed. Very well kept and clean too. You don't have to pay to walk around the outside gardens so go back there on another occasion. Return in the evening for the light show through as this is fabulous....and free!",,
,,if you have knowledge of plants you will love it,5,,"Plan to get there by 5 pm at the latest. This way you can watch the gardens leisurely , enjoy the food and relax for some time and then experience the night time lights show which is a wonderful experience. Take care if you wish to have dinner after the lights show , take your place at the restaurant of your choice a few minutes before the end of the show. Otherwise be prepared for long queues.",,
,,Bus 400 from Merlion Park,5,,"Take bus 400 from Merlion Park to get here. This place is huge so manage your time. Try to go during the day more to the evening side, you can see the Supertree light up. Really beautiful at night. 3 things to go here is the Flower Dome, Cloud Forest and the OCBC Skyway.",,
,,a nice place to spend a day,4,,"a day walk around the gardens by the bay
overall this area is quite big with few parks, restaurants playground
can walk around without any tickets for most of the places
those need to pay also quite nice to go in like the supertree grove, cloud forest and so on...",,
,,Great day out,5,,"Beautiful gardens with plenty to see, a great day out for everyone. The gardens are free to enter and there is plenty to see, you do need to pay to enter the domes or to go up onto the OCBC Skyway but these are optional.",,
,,Amazingly Beautiful,5,,"This is a park with a collection of beautiful themed gardens with amazing sculptures and structures. You can enjoy this park for free, but there are exhibits; the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome for which there is an entry fee. The Dragon Lake is particularly worthy of note, with this and other parts of the park offering great photo opportunities. You can easily spend 1 鈥?2 hours here or more if you choose the exhibits with entry fees. A must see in Singapore.",,
,,Visionary modern gardens - a must see in Singapore,5,,"My partner and stayed at the Marina Bay Sands and we walked around the Gardens early over two mornings. What an amazing job Singapore has done in balancing up the downtown high rises with such a large open space for residents and tourists alike.

The gardens are just beautiful, very clean and the man made vase tress which are growing plants over them will look truly amazing when fully covered in the next few years.

Don't miss this place on any visit to Singapore.",,
,,Amazing experience!!,5,,One of the must visit place in Singapore. Worth for the money and time. Recommended to visit at night :),,
,,beautiful light show,4,,"Probably the only nature and greenery you are going to see, will be in the botanical gardens, I was stunned by the natural crystal rocks selection, brilliant interiors and variety of plants and flowers. The vibe is very relaxing and happy. The gardens hosts sound and light show every eve (Check what it is called)",,
,,Amazing Experience,5,,A must watch place for who love flowers. Amazing place and spend the whole day there to see in the night as well.,,
,,A Beautiful garden,5,,an enjoyable afternoon which was worth every cent. we had tea and there is just so much to see. it is never a dull moment. schools should definitely bring their students to this memorable paradise. we will definitely be back to relive the moment. :-),,
,,Simply Amazing-Don't Miss,5,,"Visited GBTB on two occasions during a one week stay in Singapore. Our first visit was to catch the free Garden Rhapsody Light Show (7:45 & 8:45 pm nightly) - I can't even begin to describe it...choreographed to music, the Supertree Grove lights up and is amazing! It really is magical...stand under the Skyway and walk around for best pictures! My second visit was during the day when I came back to see the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. I wasn't planning on seeing them, but was SO hot (they are air-conditioned) so decided to go in and get cooled off and was SO glad I did. They were beautiful! I think the Cloud Forest was my favorite not only for the beautiful plants and flowers, but it has an AMAZING waterfall and beautiful views of the Marina Bay Sands and the Supertrees through the windows. Also, have to highly recommend walking over to Satay by the Bay (next to Children's Garden) for an excellent, inexpensive lunch (Satay, Hawker Station type food)! Highly recommend GBTB!",,
,,"Beautiful day or night, just leave enough time to see it all",5,,"We went at 4pm and stayed till 9pm and still did not see it all. Spent over 1.5 hours in the cloud forrest and about the same in the flower dome. So worth the visit, one of the best attractions I have ever been to! The interpretation inside the cloud forrest is so well done - interactive and engaging. The flora is stunning and the way they have created an indoor landscape is just amazing.
The supertrees really are stunning at night.

We had dinner at satay by the bay, yes,, prices were slightly higher,but food was good!

Ran out of time in the end. We were tired. Unfortunately a thunderstorm came through and they had to close the Children's playground, so we missed out on that.

Going back again next time to see the things we missed!",,
,,Excellent,4,,"Walked from Pan Pacific Hotel to Gardens by the Bay, visiting in the morning. Thought the Cloud Forest was v good, and as it was daytime it was not cold in this dome.",,
,,Beautiful light show in the evening,5,,Loved the Gardens by the Bay. Beautiful light show after dark and stunningly botanic gardens. Very impressed with the engineering to keep those glass houses cool.,,
,,A must see 馃槏,5,,This is wonderful. You should visit the dome garden and cloud forest. Amazingly made. Also in the night outside there is beautiful musical light show which is must watch. The dome and cloud forest have timing 9 am to 9 pm and the light shows are from 8/8.30 pm,,
,,Incredible!,5,,"So beautiful, so much to see, well laid out, lots of facilities, and a very reasonable price. Don鈥檛 miss them.",,
,,Lovely gardens,5,,The domes are well worth a visit. Lots of lovely flowers and some made from Lego on display when we were there. It is all very pretty.,,
,,Amazing domes,4,,"Very well laid out and the domes are amazing, especially the rain forest. There could be more undercover attractions as it always rains in the afternoon and there are limited places to shelter or eat.",,
,,It鈥檚 a must do!,5,,I鈥檓 not a fan of plants or flowers. But this really blew my mind! It鈥檚 amazing to learn what a futuristic city which cares so much about the environment can do. You cannot miss it on your trip,,

,,Visit post noon & combine the sound & light show,5,,The two domes - Cloud & Forest are a must visit. Preferably start post 3pm and end with Sound & Light show at 7:45 pm,,

,,Impressive of Gardens,4,,Gardens by the bay was a amazing see in night.if you go during the day it is very hot so make sure you visit in evening or night.,,
,,Cloud forest,4,,"I really loved the cloud forest whilst busy it was not crowded. The indoor waterfall was spectacular entry to the area. The whole area was amazing . Worth the 28 dollars per adult , spent about 90 minutes walking around . The walk area around the structure was great as well. Truly a magnificent and original structure.",,

,,Cool kid鈥檚 spot,5,,"The place is made of fountains for kids. No pool, no slides. Only safe environment for the kids and kids at heart to play under the moving fountains come with great children songs!

You can bring food so if the kids are tired running and jumping around. Kids are guided by the lifeguards around so no need to feel
uncomfortable while staying.
They are all attentive to the needs of the children.

Comfort rooms and shower rooms are enough to the kids and parents for free.

nice place to stay and bond with kids during summer.",,
,,Worthwhile,4,,Just went as part of Singapore by night tour to see light show which went on at 7.45pm to 8pm roughly.,,

,,The Gardens of the Gods,5,,"This is a 'must do' for your visit to Singapore. It is a short walk across the bridge from the Marina Bay Sands. Not that I'm botanical expert by any means, but this is the best display of plants, flowers, and displays that I have ever seen. It is obvious that there was no expense spared in building and maintaining these exhibits. Take your time and see it all...both the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest.",,
,,MUST VISIT,5,,"One of the best days out. So well laid out we did the audio tour of the outside gardens to start the day off then both of the domes which put the Eden project to shame an amazing feat of engineering with fabulous flower displays with a sky walk around the different levels of the dome. You really need the best part of a day to do it justice.
Then there is the skywalk out side which gives great views of all the super trees and over to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel
We returned at night to watch the sunset in the super tree and then came down to watch the light show which was a 15 minute spectacular set to music FAB-U-LOUS. Then back up the super tree for dinner one of the best days out we have ever had you won't be disappointed",,
,,Truly Magnificent,5,,"It was really nice different from what I am use to in Japan, a lot of beautiful sites to see I really enjoyed myself",,

,,The night show is the one must do if you have only one night in Singapore!,5,,Just beautiful! Stunning light show done to music. The choice of music was wonderful and the light show takes your breath away. Just the right length of time if you have to stand. Two shows a night. My favourite part of my four days in Singapore.,,
,,Not to be missed,5,,What a fantastic place to visit. The light show on every night is masterful and walking round the gardens and the domes is and experience to view wonderful plants and flowers. Well worth a visit,,

,,Tulipmania 馃尫,4,,"Hi

Garden by the Bay may consider selling tulips at Tulipmania. I am sure a lot of flower enthusiasts would love to buy them .

It will be wonderful if we could see roses at Garden by the Bay in the near future. Can consider having this event near Valentine day. It will definitely be very romantic and attract lots of visitors.

Besides having the same Sakura n Tulips . Roses will have its own group of big fans as well.

Hope our dream for bed of roses can be fulfilled at Garden by the Bay!

Thank you.",,
,,There is more to it than just those Supertrees!,5,,"The picture of manmade Supertrees has become an iconic image of Singapore. If you ask me they deserve that recognition as a lot of work is put in maintaining this oasis. There is more to the Gardens by the Bay than just Flower Dome and Cloud Forest, so if you have time to walk around just do it! When we walked through them during the day I felt very special, but in the evening Supertrees comes to live. Every day at 7:45 pm and 21:45 pm they have a light and music performance. If you expect steel trees bounding to the ground that will not happen, but it's very nice to sit in the crowd, looking up to the changing lights and listen to the music. However I got almost lost because I was too excited it was funny actually and I wrote a story about it on our blog page. Feel free to read it.",,
,,"Beautiful scenery, a lot of fun",5,,"My husband and I did the Cloud walk, flower dome and sky bridge. If you go during the day it is very hot so make sure to use plenty of sunscreen and bring water.",,
,,fascinating area but mixed environmental messages left me confused,4,,"The whole area looks like a designers view of 'when humans have to move to another planet'. It's very interesting and the sculptures, conservatories (flowers more than cloud in my opinion) are really well designed and maintained.
and who doesn't love a sky-walk and illuminated solar-panel trees at sunset!
My gripe is that for somewhere so focussed on the environment there is a McDonalds (not many score worse on the deforestation and animal welfare front), and a cafe selling everything in plastic containers, with straws and plastic bags on offer :-( I'd like to see the ethos in practice otherwise it feels just like a money spinner.",,
,,Fabulous Gardens,5,,Spectacular gardens with breath taking views for wonderful photo opportunities. The two domes were source have great information. The evening light show was a great eay to finish a beautiful day.,,
,,A happy place,5,,"This is definitely a cool place (literally) to hang out with friends and family in hot, humid Singapore. When you鈥檙e done with shops and all the glams the city has to offer, this is a great chilling place. Blooming flowers everywhere and they have restaurants in the area! Really, what could go wrong?",,
,,Great visit,5,,Great visit - amazing to see the light show at night. The gardens can get busy at certain points at weekends.,,
,,In time for tulip mania!,5,,"We were very fortunate having visited Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay during their tulip exhibition. We were very impressed not only by the flowers but how well they were presented. Of course there were many other attractions. The succulents at the entrance, the baoabs and the other flora variety. We were pleased the temperature inside was pleasantly controlled. Even with hundreds of other people, the dome never got cramped. Equally impressive was the Cloud Forest where we were treated to layers upon layers of tropical plants - with waterfalls and scheduled mist to boot. We will definitely be back...
Getting there is easy: take the MRT to Marina Bay then transfer to Bayfront. From there, its a long corridor away to the entrance of Gardens by the Bay. Shuttles are available to the two conservatories for only SGD3. If the weather is pleasant, guests can walk the 15-20min trek amidst the outdoor garden.",,
,,Greeeeeeeeen,5,,"A cool , nice and a environmental place to enjoy the greens and trees from Singapore. The humid weather makes you feel comfortable when you explore the gardens",,
,,Impressive even when its busy,4,,Excellent location and we had a great experience regardless of how many people there were. Very well presented and one of its kind especially in Asia .. recommend this place but obviously better on non peak times,,
,,Simply awesome!,5,,"The whole Marina Bay Sands offering is becoming a compelling part of any Singapore visit!
The light show at Gardens by the Bay is a real highlight!
The dual gardens featuring flowers and an artificial mountain are deserving of around two hours each, and also presents a welcome respite to the Singapore climate.",,
,,Must See..Different Concept,5,,"Gardens by the Bay outside and the evening light show is free of charge. Only flower dome, cloud forests and skywalk need to have tickets. Booked the ticket online. As two domes are inside and have A.C., best to see when it's hot outside, takes max 3 hours for 2 domes. We started with audio tour to see the outside gardens as did not want to walk, worth it, covered full garden with info. Dropped at flower dome. Wonderful ambience with different colour and variety of tulips and other flowers. Falls at cloud forest was awesome. Lunch we had at satay by the bay. Well spent first half of the day. Light show we went another day clubbed with spectra light show.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,"Suggest buying tickets in advance. Go during the week - late in afternoon. Visit the 2 domes. Could take 4-5 hrs. Weekends lots of people. Lots of school children during the week days It is a 15 minute walk from the park - there is a bridge from the gardens to the Marina Bay Hotel.......

There are several gift shops.......so if you don't find the size in one they may have in the other.

Suggest go to domes in in day. then have dinner or go back to Hotel for rest. then visit the gardens - outside the domes which is free to see the light show........Wish I had done this.......then go to the Hotel to see the view from the top.",,
,,Excellent place,4,,good experience to visit this lovely place. extremely nice sound and light show. Easily accessible from anywhere in town.,,
,,Beautiful Gardens by the Bay,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is a combination of few attractions The Flower Dome + The Cloud Forest + Super Trees

Inside the Flower Dome, there are many beautiful flower trees so as inside The Cloud Forest. But the only difference is the waterfalls all under a glass dome and the misty environment.

At the night time these trees light up and the view is so beautiful.",,
,,Wonderful Gardens,5,,Great location. Perfect spot for plant lovers. Beautiful arrangement. Must see. In a subtropical Area it is relaxing to go inside.,,
,,Excellent,5,,"Visited the well laid out gardens by the bay. Exhilarating, particularly the flower dome with exhibition of Tulips. A must see place in Singapore",,
,,Unique Experience - Gardens by the Bay,5,,"Gardens by the Bay included so many beautiful attractions. The Flower Dome was holding a Tulipmania Exhibit which was so colorful with numerous different types of flowers not just tulips.

The Cloud Forest was a walk through colorful vegetation, flowers and waterfalls all under a glass dome.

Super Trees give you an overall view of the the bay and marina. At night the trees light up and provide a breathtaking view of the marina.

You must visit the Bay Sands Hotel overlooking the bay. Its unique architecture is awesome.",,
,,What a Great Way to Spend A Day,5,,"What an absolutely wonderful experience, unfortunately could only stay till early evening as my wife was flagging following a recent illness, so we missed the lights and music show. BUT what we experienced was stunning, in particular the forest in the clouds dome. The skywalk was brilliant and all employees / staff very helpful. Anyone visiting Singapore must, must, must, visit this place. Tip, buy tickets in advance and collect en route to the Gardens.",,
,,A must see Attraction,5,,"Very interesting place.
Both day and night view were stunning, so do plan your schedule.

We arrived around 4.30pm, stroll around the huge park, then get into the Dome (need entrance fee)

If you dont want to enter the Dome, chill at the restaurant nearby and wait for the Supertree lightshow at 7.45pm",,
,,Gardens by the Bay - an absolute must when you are in Singapore,5,,Gardens by the Bay - you would like to visit this beautiful garden over and over again. There are no words to explain the beauty of this fantastic garden of Singapore. We visited it both in daytime and at night. Both are highly recommended. The light show at night are above imagination. You just have to see it!,,
,,Interesting but not spectacular,3,,"This is my 2nd trip. Got tickets to both the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. The Tulipmania (in Flower Dome) is currently one of the new attractions, available for only a month. Everything was nice, but not particularly amazing. Still worth a trip if you haven't been there. If you have already visited the place once, will suggest just buying the ticket for the Flower Dome. The weather is hot if you decide to walk from Bayfront MRT station, so please be prepared.",,
,,It鈥檚 really wonderful,5,,"Garden by the bay is really wonderful, beautiful and lovely attraction. It is inside the dome. The main attraction are tulips. The tulips are different and uncounted in colours. To see this attraction an entry ticket is required. If visited Singapore then never miss this amazing garden.",,
,,Tulip Mania,3,,It fell a bit short of my expectations as last years Tulip mania for far far better than this one. This seems to have been hurriedly put together as we could see bulbs at places too.,,
,,Nice surprise,5,,My 1 yr 3 month old girl refused to practice walking at home but she was so excited to practise walking by going round and round the flower dome! Thank you for giving us tremendous joy at the Tulipmania,,
,,Morning at the Gardens,5,,"We first wandered around the stunning park on the way to the Rain-forest dome.
In awe of this dome. Try to arrive at misting time but not necessary.
Took the audio tour which was well worth the minimal cost as got to see some of park that we did walk around.
Super trees fantastic. Revisited park at night for sound & light show. Also brilliant",,
,,A short stopover visit,4,,"Lovely and dramatic , great views but did not go into the glass houses as very expensive entrance but they looked good . Had a coffee outside overlooking the Singapore river",,
,,Must see attractions,5,,"Majority of the gardens are free to enter and are brilliant on their own, plus two enclosed domes of tropical and world flora that are paid for. At night there is a light and music display which can be again seen for free (the artificial trees light up to the beat of the music, which was movie themed for our trip) or you can pay (and if you time it right) to be up in the canopy walkway suspended between the trees",,
,,Third Visit,5,,The cactus and succulents plants are outstanding. However the tulips and hyacinths were beautiful. Enjoyed the Australian plants and the Nikau palms from NZ. Delicious food and wine at Pollen cafe. Looking forward to my next visit.,,
,,Amazing Park,5,,This is the most amazing flower park I've ever seen. There are thousand of beautiful flowers and plants from all over the world. temperature inside the dome is super cold... I didn't expect it can be so cold inside. Please don't forget to bring your jacket if you plan to come by. Two thumbs up for Singapore.,,
,,Must do!,5,,"While I have walked around and photographed Gardens by the Bay on other occasions this was the first time I had ventured inside the domes. Tulips galore inside the Flower Dome as a special attraction, really stunning. The Cloud Forest was spectacular.",,
,,nice relaxing romantic visit to gardens by the bay,5,,Both domes are worth going to. flower exhibitions are so nicely planted and provide natural feeling in nature. really worth the visit to relax and date. architecture os the domes are beautifully done like a green house. we liked the efforts of gardens by the bay to educate on conservation which is valuable for future generations.,,
,,Afternoon at the Gardens,5,,"Arrived about 4pm. Did the domes first then down to ""satay on the bay"", then watched the night show.
This was a real great experience. Sooo much more to see. Will have to make another trip.
Singapore just does everthing well. The whole place is dialed up to 11. The gardens are an absolute knockout.
Make sure you have plenty of time and see it at both night and day.",,
,,Stunning.,5,,"This stunning garden complex is a ""must see"" in Singapore. Even if you don't like gardens you will be stunned by the sheer size of this place and its contents. Climb up and up on the walkways taking you to the roof and the top of the trees for the full experience. Give yourself the best part of a day to do it justice. Easily reached on foot from the city centre. We absolutely loved this place.",,
,,Amazing,5,,An absolute must if you visit Singapore. The entrance tickets are very reasonable and the whole place is super tourist friendly and well signposted. If you ge there early you can get the whole walkway to yourself.,,
,,"Domes, Trees, Lightshow, stunning views!",5,,"Visited the Gardens in April 2018 and loved it. Both domes are great, but Cloud Forrest Dome is the more amazing one. The Supertrees are an iconic sight, and the OCBC Skywalk is very well worth the 8S$ charge, as it offers great views of Supertree Grove, the Singapore Flyer and Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Recommend you go twice, once during the day and then return for the stunning lightshow!",,
,,See the cloud forest and flower dome,5,,The cloud forest has a stunning waterfall. You take an elevator all the way to the top and walk down the path. Along the way you see the plants as well as crystals. Very doable in a short time,,
,,amazing place,5,,"This is a must see while in Singapore. Best attraction to walk around and see thousands of different plans from all over the world. Visit both domes, spend at least an hour on each. Been here a dozen times and each time there's always something new.",,
,,All you need to know about beautiful garden by the bay,5,,"* Nearest metro station is Bayfront , gardens are interconnected to the
Bayfront MRT

* don鈥檛 opt for shuttles (3$ per person ) until and unless you can鈥檛 walk , shuttles are shear wastage of money as domes are hardly 400 meters from the ticket counter

* Both Cloud forest & flower domes beautiful and must visit places

* Premises has multiple food joints but most famous is McDonald鈥檚, it also has some vegetarian options ( good for Indians)

* 7:45 PM they start light show at super groove which is awesome & same show they repeat at 8:45PM also . 15 mins is the duration of the show

* except for flower and forest domes you need not to buy entry ticket

* OCBC walk in the evening is mesmerising and adds starts to your memories

* we bought tickets from vyogain website worth 1250 per head , it includes entry tickets for domes and OCBC walkway at night .",,
,,Well Laid out,4,,"On a humid day this is the best place to be. If you are only going to the garden bay then it is free , but if you are also going to see the Clouds, then you have to buy tickets. If you are into gardening then this is the place to be. The layout is excellent with various flowers and plants. When we were there we got to see the Japanese cherry blossoms in white and pink. Both the domes take a lot of time, (about 4 hrs.) but cloud forest took few hours extra. The waterfall at the entrance sprinkles rain at specific intervals. The walk on the bridge is awesome and I am told if you go in the evening the whole place is lit up, which makes it awesome.
Have a great day",,
,,Awesome,4,,"The flower gardens and the Amazon rain forest were a treat to our eyes. Since it was raining, the skywalk was closed, but we enjoyed the dome which bred rare and unique plants.",,
,,Brilliant,5,,Fantastic make sure you walk around the cable walkway and visit the night laser show.Otters are in the Park look out for them you will have a great day.Eat at Satay by the Bay!!!!!!!!!,,
,,Great for an afternoon stroll,5,,Lovely gardens that a great to wander around and escape the 鈥榟ustle and bustle鈥?of the city but within a short distance from downtown Many different paths and areas to explore Have been many times and always find new corners to enjoy,,
,,Nice place to visit,4,,It nice place to visit and can get fresh air here. Good for visit with family. Many restaurant and interesting things here,,
,,Worth the visit,4,,"We used the hop on hop off bus and arrived at the Marina Bay hotel and just found our way into the Gardens by the Bay by entering through the hotel, it鈥檚 a very long walk around the gardens and to be honest after about 30 mind I had seen enough.",,
,,Good display,4,,"Imagine that you went to a permanent flower show. Cool,, with distinct groupings that make it interesting",,
,,Beautiful & Worth the experience.,5,,"Singapore is a relatively small country with limited space. It was beautifully constructed and with many varieties of plants. we visit during the tulip show. I visioned many new varieties from my knowledge. Very beautiful. You are not only experiencing the architectural construction but also the different vegetation. There are two light shows daily on the open ground outside the building. Be prepared to spend good 4-5 hours if you really want to know all the plants.
We bought our tickets on line, Actually it is cheaper to pay on site(almost 50% cheaper)",,
,,A must see,5,,Well worth the visit. Both Domes and skywalk are a must do if you are in the area. Fantastic displays and view. We visited during the tulip festival. Fantastic work!,,
,,Unique place,5,,"Visited the gardens while on business in Singapore. The gardens are a great place for a walk to enjoy nature. An amazing variety of plants and trees. The super trees are a stunning sight, both at their base and on the suspended cat walk ($S8 charge). I visited twice, once in the morning to enjoy the park and the other in the evening to take in the light show, both were great. Visiting this place is a must if you are in Singapore.",,
,,A Must while in Singapore,4,,This is one of the attractions in Singapore that must be on your time table when visiting Singapore My wife and me enjoyed it tremendously Don鈥檛 miss it Dr and Mrs S C Mathews UK,,
,,An amazing complex garden,5,,"Huge so plan 1/2 day there. Very ecology-focused. Especially of interest are The Dome, and the Super Trees and their elevated growing walkways. There is a trolley to take you around narrated on a very hot day, plus very cold water to be bought.",,
,,Afternoon visit,5,,From the outside looking at the domes you imagine the insides to be amazing but I felt disappointed not good really. The garden outside are really lovely and the super trees are a fantastic sight and the show on the evenings are spectacular to see.,,
,,Well maintained arboretum,4,,Very nice grounds in beautiful location Small compared to U.S. gardens but packed with beautifully arranged exhibits Nice if you like this type of thing Five star for what it is But not my favorite thing in Singapore,,
,,A must visit place for nature lovers,5,,One of the worlds best nature park with vast variety of worlds best flowers and such an equisite beauty.all i can say is wow to the creativity of this concept.Dont miss this folks....you鈥檒l just love it.,,
,,Spectacular View,4,,Love the scenery at this place. We went for OCBC Skyway with entrance fee of $8 and been given 15mnt to walk around the area. Good place to chill with friends and family.,,
,,Day off during business trip,5,,The gardens are a great place to visit and beautiful to see. The displays are well thought out and arranged. The garden in the sky was our favourite. Well worth a visit during any stay in Singapore.,,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,"A little on the ""man-made"" side but still enjoyable to visit. Gardens inside are well kept and enjoyable to walk through. The super trees are very cool.",,
,,Beautiful gardens,5,,So many different flowers and plants. Worth a visit once. Took a lot of pics. Loved the whole ambience. In the evening they have the gardens by the bay musical show. Tats a must watch. The tockets were booked online and was completely hassle free.,,
,,Dont miss this!,5,,"Gardens by the Bay are an amazing place, and well worth a visit. The trees are stunning, and definitely don't miss the evening light show.",,
,,Awesome place,5,,"Best place to visit for people love nature, you can find some of the unique plants and flowers which you find it difficult else where....",,
,,Beautiful,5,,We visited the gardens in the evening for the show of lights after dining at the restaurant on the top of the Marina Bay hotel. It was a spectacular display that must not be missed.,,
,,Speechless,5,,What an incredible place. The cloud dome was the highlight. Came over emotional when I walked in. Beautiful doesn鈥檛 even begin to describe it. A really lovely afternoon and evening can be spent here. Most of it is free apart from the domes and walking along the lighted trees. A must visit when in Singapore,,
,,One of the best place i have ever been,5,,What a concept! A must place to visit in singapore. What an Engineering marvel. Its really well maintained and it has wide variety of plants. You need to have atleast 4 hours to complete this place,,
,,Super trees blooming as fireworks in amazing music,5,,"No sooner had we arrived the Super tree Grove at Garden by the Bay than the light show started. We were exhilarated to see the colourful light trees as beautiful as blooming fireworks in amazing music.

The only problem is that our neck felt a bit exhausted after looking up our head for quite a while.

I would highly recommend this free spectacular light show.",,
,,Don't miss this attraction,5,,"A visit here is very special and the detail and hard work put in is clear to see. Apart from the beautiful flora there is also a strong ecological message . This is a place for all ages to learn from ,extremely interesting and beautifully presented.
There are a number of restaurants and plenty of toilet facilities.
I would say that a light jacket might be an idea inside the various lands atrium ,we found it cold there but not in the waterfall and orchid atrium.
A walk around the gardens outside are lovely,can be warm and humid though,cooler late afternoon.
It can get very busy but never seemed to be so you couldn't read or view all on offer in this wonderful place.",,
,,Fusion restos galore,5,,Singapore has top food bar none. And some of the best surround gardens by the bay. Just keep the platinum card home or you'll start swiping at the luxury goods stores right around the corner,,
,,Top quality attraction,5,,"Really enjoyed our visit here, would recommend the OCBC Skyway a walkway between several man made tree like structures 22 metres off the ground giving a great view of the gardens, the bay and, of course the Marina Sands Hotel. We also enjoyed Supertree Grove, and the whole thing has been put together well.",,
,,A must do when in Singapore.,5,,Truly a unique experience. Well worth a visit. Can be a little cool inside the domes so worth bringing a jacket.,,
,,Tulip-Mania,5,,This was so worthwhile. Magnificent display of Tulips all under cover and air controlled temperature.,,
,,Outstanding attraction,5,,We were awe struck by this outstanding attraction. The two domes were outstanding both offering something different. The 鈥渢rees鈥?were great and it鈥檚 worth being there for the light show.... mesmerising!!,,
,,Everyone visiting Singapore must go here,5,,"Under 2 air conditioned domes this is an amazing spectacle for the eyes. This is a place to spend at least half a day wandering through to look, learn and see how amazing this is. Trees and plants from around the world flourish in this controlled comfortable environment that is suited to all ages. The crowds build up from midday, so I would suggest getting there early. I believe it鈥檚 open from 5am!! Take a good camera and comfortable footwear.",,
,,An Amazing Venue,5,,Wha at fanatic venue. We travelled in a driverless car and saw wonderful sights. We visted both in the day and night time and to see it in the dark it is a must to see sight.,,
,,Great photography opportunities,5,,Went to both domes - the flower dome is the better of the two. We spent a few hours refining the photography skills.,,
,,Memorable visit,5,,A wondrous place that left me spellbound and in awe! Beautiful! The technology that went into the creation of this magnificent structure is truly beyond words!,,
,,On tour with the Mc Lintons again,5,,"This was our second time to gardens by the bay, we took our travelling companions this time, it is simply magic, love the place & they did as well.",,
,,AMAZING,5,,Can't begin to describe this experience. Simply amazing and no photo does the real thing justice. Take your camera and a lot of time. Even with crowds the experience is personal.,,
,,Amazing collection,5,,"It was the day before the Tulip festival, but they still had good number of Tulips planted. Climate controlled space and it can be a bit cold (dress appropriately).",,
,,night and day,5,,"Visit in daylight hours to enjoy the magnificent plants and water features. entry to the garden area is free but there is a charge if you wish to enter the domed attractions or walk in the tree tops, both very worthwhile . At night the synchronised light and audio show is absolutely spell binding and again no admission charge. Show usually starts at about 7.45 but get there a little earlier to ensure a good viewing spot. Best viewing tends to be on the edge of the trees to take in the whole spectacle. Plenty of eateries available.",,
,,Very nice!,4,,"Heard lot of great things about the gardens and it was really beautiful. It was very well maintained and had lot of varieties of different plants and trees.
Unfortunately we went quite late at night and we missed out on other attractions but still managed to see the lightshow.",,
,,Terrific visit,5,,"I visited Gardens by the Bay twice on my recent visit to Singapore. The first time to view the light show in the evening which was amazing. I then returned on Sunday to visit the 2 conservatories. It was Tulipmania in the Flower Dome which was beautiful very well done. As it was the opening weekend it was busy but still very manageable. The gift shops have nice items very reasonably priced, I did most of my shopping for friends and family here. All staff I encountered were friendly and helpful. All in all a lovely visit and highly recommend anyone visiting Singapore to visit. I had hoped to return to view the gardens outside of the conservatories as heavy rain meant I cut my visit short unfortunately I ran out of time to return. I am already planning my next holiday to Singapore and Gardens by the Bay is at the top of the list of attractions to see.",,
,,Great place for a walk,5,,Living in Singapore once in a while I take a walk though Gardens by the bay. Really relaxing place. Easy to reach and close to MBS. Has some food options inside as well. Couple restaurants and a food court.,,
,,Great leisure place with free access for people,5,,This is a wonderful place with so much green in a busy modern city. It has a lot to see. Make sure that you don鈥檛 miss the amazing daily light show at 7:45pm.,,
,,Great afternoon/ Night visit,5,,Great place in the afternoon to visit all the gardens and different themes. Then to stay on for the liaght and music show. Recommend this a must to do on a trip to Singapore,,
,,Good as always,5,,"Just visited the cloud dome, as this is our preferred one. A great spot to explore with the kids. Love all the sculptures as well",,
,,Much more than the Cloud Forest & Flower Dome,5,,"I'm amazed by the creativity of the architect(s) who designed the remarkable Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. I've never seen structures like these, with the added advantage of all the plants & nice, cool air. You'll definitely want to back-track & experience everything at least once again (perhaps twice again!) but no need. Just get your arm / wrist stamped on your way out & do it again. Save money & buy your tickets on-line. Save your personal thermostat & visit in the heat of the afternoon to make the most of the cool climate inside. Save the crowds for someone else & visit on a weekday. Many attractions in Singapore close on Monday, but this is something that's open every day... still, check on the computer before your visit. About once a month one or the other building's closed for maintenance. In the Flower Dome they have regular themed flower displays. In March they had an Easter theme (bunnies & chocolate eggs) & in April they had a Sakura Matsuri (Japanese cherry blossom festival) theme. It's not cheap to visit, but you'll hate yourself if you miss out!
Before your visit you can tour some of the other attractions at Gardens by the Bay, all of which are free. Ethnic gardens, sculptures including Planet (the huge gravity defying baby), topical gardens: cactus, orchid, etc. The area's vast & every turn in the path has something you'll want to see... even if you're not a mad keen garden buff.
After your visit to the Cloud Forest & Flower Dome, check out the GbbBay things you'd missed earlier, & cool off / rest in Satay by the Bay; the GbbB food centre. They have shady places to sit, cool drinks, & yummy food to suit every budget. Yes, even inexpensive food! The MRT Bayfront has an exit inside GbbB, or you can enter Marina Bay Sands, gawk at everything, take the outside lift to the 3rd or 4th floor (forget which, but everyone will be going there), & walk across the fun & scenic elevated walkway. If you're not worn out by now, stay on for the sound & light shows at MBS and in the Supertree Grove!",,
,,Mind blowing Botanical Garden,5,,"A must visit when you are in Singapore, and very close the the Marina Bay Financial Center. Giant enclosed gardens, a 100鈥?waterfall, SuperTrees- the place is right out of BladeRunner or Silent Running. Don鈥檛 miss this, or the Singapore National Botanical Greens either.",,
,,Out of this world,5,,Amazing in every aspect. And make sure you see the light show in the evening. Something we will remember for the rest of our lives.,,
,,"Unmissable, and I really mean that!",5,,"Easy access from the MRT, and it's worth using the shuttle to get to the main areas.
Lovely to see at night with the super trees lit up. However, we went in the morning when it was cooler to walk around and less crowded.
The two domes are well worth paying for, in fact if you don't then you will miss real treats.
The flower dome is good and has an incredible variety of plants to see. As it was near Christmas, the display for the festive period looked a bit tacky, but that is par for the course.
The cloud forest though, is (almost) out of this world. Breathtaking and so well laid out. I count this as one of the best attractions I have ever visited.",,
,,WOW!,5,,Not much else to say than: FAB! I cannot get that garden out of my hair. This is a must-see when in Singapore.,,
,,Amazing Light Show!,5,,"Amazing display of lights, color and music! Free too! Singapore is good to its tourists. Safe, clean and beautiful attractions. Easy public transportation too.",,
,,Amazing place to explore,5,,"We went early in the morning, a good time to go to avoid the heat of the day. The cloud forest and the flower dome were both incredible and the super trees are something out of this world. Fantastic photo opportunities throughout the gardens. There are parts of environmental educational, however it is sad because the gift shop full of plastic and junk that contradicts the messages they are trying to spread.",,
,,Gardens by the bay,5,,Beautiful spot - great kids waterpark Cafe nearby easy cheap meals Great to spend the day there. Beautiful gardens,,
,,Beautiful,5,,One of the main attractions of Singapore. It鈥檚 worth buying a ticket to walk across the gangway for amazing views of the gardens and Singapore. Fabulous photo opportunities. This attraction is worth seeing both during day and nighttime.,,
,,Must visit in Singapore,5,,"We loved this place! It is huge and can take upto one entire day to explore thoroughly.

We spent a lot of time on the bridge walking from Marina Bay Sands hotel to the gardens by the bay. Then we explored the Dome as well as the vertical waterfall. The Dome had a pop up Cherry Blossom exhibition which was packed but worth it.

In the evening, they have a sound and light show, definitely a must see. Would highly recommend this place to all tourists.",,
,,Great visit to gardens by the bay,5,,"We were recommended to visit the garden by the bay .
This attraction is very nice and a must if you visit Singapore.
The gardens are very nice and it was very warm out side but AC inside.
Great tour and you can buy your tickets at the entrance",,
,,Walk through Marina Bay Sands to Garden by The Bay,4,,"Another option to Garden by the Bay is walking from Marina Bay Sand's Mall top floor, walking on a bridge through Marina Bay Hotel and you will arrive in the Garden by the Bay.",,
,,Awesome,4,,"Visited both the gardens ,but best one was the cloud forest seeing that it was always hot and steaming in Singapore it was a welcome relieve to feel the coolness of the , waterfall and cool mist, but apart from that the tropical flowers and orchids were awesome the colours were fantastic.",,
,,Best place in Singapore,5,,"The gardens are a must see oasis in downtown Singapore. The domes are amazing! We spent 2 days there - the first we saw the cloud forest, flower dome and walked the gardens. The second we went for the supertree grove lightning show, which was beautiful and unforgettable!",,
,,green green,5,,"visiting a friend of us staying not as a tourist but a resident with the benefit of a chauffeus we where lucky to be taken to that ship in the sky.swimming pool.trees terrace and a superbe restaurant.the view is breath taking.all that followed by a visit to the near by gardens and greenhouses

,,Fantastic!,5,,Loved it! Cloud Forest a favourite. I got there about 6pm & sunset was from about 6:45 onwards - a good time to go. A must in Singapore.,,
,,Amazing,5,,Gardens by the Bay is well worth visiting. There are so many things to see and do. A must is the cloud forest. Just amazing. Go to the plant and flower conservatory next door as well. This is also amazing. And of course the huge flower statues. Try to go at night as well as they have a light show at 7.45. This place is just amazing for young and old.,,
,,Night light show fabulous and free,5,,"The two domes are wonderful, especially the cloud dome. However the free night lights show is absolutely stunning. We saw it twice and would go again. Brilliant!",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"We spend almost whole day roaming around. Easy accesable via subway. Beautiful scenery. We saw turtles, komodo dragon-like iguana or something, loads of fishes and lizzards. The Lost world forest was breath taking (and cool temperature). We had a bite at Satay at the Bay which is a foodcourt. Too bad the kids waterplayground was closed :(",,
,,Very beautiful and enjoyable visit,4,,"Located just opposite Marina Bay Sand closest MRT is Bayfront
There are 2 domes one is Flower Dome ( the outstanding one is the tulip garden ) the other dome is Cloud Forest where the trees are tall and there are 35 metre man made mountain and water falls
At 7.45 pm and 8.45 pm there will be spectacular display of light and sound show from the OCBC skyway .
It is also worth buying $3 for unlimited shuttle bus",,
,,Beautiful,5,,Overnight stop over. This was a place I have always wanted to visit - and I wasn鈥檛 disappointed it was beautiful just as I expected. We went up to IndoChine the view was stunning of the gardens and the city. Love to go back one day during the day.,,
,,The best ever,5,,"We've been lucky to have visited many botanical gardens in the world. But hands down, Gardens by the Bay is the most spectacular. We were there in the evening, free to all, and stayed for the evening light show. Absolutely fantastic. Went back the next morning for the two domed exhibits. Didn't want to leave. Just beautiful.",,
,,A beautiful place.,4,,I visited gardens by the bay yesterday evening. This is a beautiful and tranquil place to visit. Because of the rain I couldn't get on the elevated walkway but none the less got some great photos.,,
,,A Fabulous Garden located in City Center,5,,"This is a MUST-GO spot in Singapore. Wide variety of flowers and trees from different countries can be found here. All the plants are in good condition and nice presentation.

Friendly reminders:
- Part of the Cloud Forest is designed in one-way tour. You are not expected to exit earlier in the mid of your journey once get started (but no worry, emergency exits are available for urgent purpose).
- Don't miss the super tree light show at night, it is so elegant and beautiful.
- Bring your jacket! The temperature is kept low in the domes.
- Bring your fully charged camera!
- Buy the shuttle bus ticket, if you don't want to walk too much. I can get out very quick after the light show and escape from the crowd. It worth the SGD3.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay - horticultural delight,5,,This garden complex is massive!! There鈥檚 2 indoor gardens (payment required to enter) which take a minimum of 1 hour each to get through and even longer if you want to explore the exquisite nature biomes in more detail. Then there鈥檚 the external gardens that you can walk for free. We didn鈥檛 get to walk these outside gardens as this would require a full day to explore in totality!!,,
,,Magnificient!,5,,"Grove its like in movie Avatar. Yiu feel like you on other planet. Magnificient. Beautifull! Diferent trees and flowers, fountain from water, stone monuments etc",,
,,Must see the Trees at night,5,,"Had been told about the giant tree structures before we visited. Not one for heights but still enjoyed the aerial walkway - quite stable and spacious and we had a breeze free experience.
Must visit in the evening to experience the city buildings lit up and to join the crowd to watch the (free) music and light show. Not to be missed. A highlight of the city.",,
,,Fantastic Gardens,5,,The Gardens by the bay are a must visit. We visited in the evening for the light show and during the day to see all the lovely gardens. It is a very extensive facility which takes a full day at least to explore. The walkway between the trees is worth a visit if you are OK with heights - it does 'flex' and some people may find this uncomfortable. The views are stunning.,,
,,So humid but so worth it,5,,"The walk from Bayfront MRT to the garden entrance was only about 10 minutes over a bridge, but it was so hot, sunny and humid that day that I almost gave up and went back to my hotel. I continued however and was very pleased I did. The Flower Dome was very well done, but having been to the Eden project was nothing really new as it was very similar to their Temperate Dome. The Cloud Dome however was fantastic. I most wanted to see the Supertrees however, and these did not disappoint me, and made all the humidity worth while. Sadly I was not able to do the walk in the air, due to a thunder storm moving in the the risk of being struck by lightning. I would go again but miss the Flower Dome and spend more time in the outdoor gardens, which are free to visit.",,
,,Amazing,5,,"Amazing how they maintain this Place. I don鈥檛 get tired of coming back here. The place is a bit pricey but if you are local, they offer discounted entrance fee. Online purchase before coming also saves you a few bucks.",,
,,Great place to visit - a must see for all ages,5,,"This was my second time at Gardens by the Bay - and this time with my entire family.

Though the second time from, was as amazed as the first time with the variety of biodiversity the gardens have - especially in the flower dome. The cloud forest is a hit with the kids.

The light show (rhapsody) was a first for me and quite a treat.

Of course, go there with good walking shoes.",,
,,Visual treat,5,,We were awestruck by the sound and light show at the Supertree Grove. This happens everyday from 7.45-8pm so ensure you don鈥檛 miss it. The other cool things were the Cloud Forest (with the tallest indoor waterfall in the world) and the Flower Dome (biggest greenhouse in the world). We went at night but I felt that these 2 places would be more beautiful in the day time. There are many more things like kids play area which we couldn鈥檛 see due to lack of time. Definitely a must visit.,,
,,Incredible place to visit,5,,a fantastic place to visit over and over again. So much to see and do and so well organised and clean. A great day out.,,
,,Amazing Must See,5,,"One of the most awesome experiences ever! Walked around the gardens during the afternoon, had dinner in one of the dining options then watched the light show choreographed to music that happens at 7:45 and 8:45 every night. It was truely amazing, cant recommend it enough for all ages.",,
,,Feeling like being in the Jurassic Park,5,,"It is amazing what man do...I am absolutely astonished by this creation. Generally Singapore has beautiful gardens and is a clean and beautiful city but Gardens by the Bay is something else. The feeling we had was like being in Jurassic Park, we were expecting dinosaurs to come out from the trees.
Especialy the night time, this place is very impressive.
It's better to begin your visit in the morning and wear comfortable shoes and clothes.
In the morning when temperature is lower begin with the open space walk and then when midday time approaches and the heat rises, head towards the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest.",,
,,The Deserved Major Attraction in Singapore,5,,"We spent two days (and one evening) exploring the gardens, towers and domes at this venue. Everything is beautifully laid out. Wheelchair access was easy and people were helpful. We ate Chilli Crab at a restaurant at this venue amusing the waitresses as we coped with the enormous seafood. The Flower Dome featured a newly opened exhibition of Tulips so it was crowded with hundreds of people taking selfies against the background of the bright colours. The Cloud Dome was of greater interest to us. It evoked the feel of a tropical forest with its tower spilling cascading waterfalls over hundreds of plants that grew up it. Wheelchair access to the top of the tower was easy as were all the pathways at this venue. A real treat for plant lovers.",,
,,It's like the Eden Project in Singapore,5,,"I'm not a fan of nature projects but it would be really difficult not to be impressed by the sheer size, scale and presence of this project.I haven't actually been to the Eden Project but from what I see of the Gardens, it's the same type of thing. The Singapore version is calm, extensive - and fairly expensive, too - but a great day out. Went with a colleague when we were both on business and it was a relaxed way to spend a Sunday afternoon.",,
,,An extremely well kept garden,5,,The skyway is the one deciding factor that made me want to visit this place. I'm glad I made this choice to visit this place. There's a relatively long queue in the ticketing booth so getting a ticket before hand is recommended. It's a bit of a walk from the closest MRT station but still manageable.,,
,,An absolute gem. Different world,5,,I really wanted to see the Gardens and I was not disappointed. It is beautiful. We were there at night time and day time and both time it is different but stunning. So much space for kids to run around and relax and walk and you just basically can spend entire day there. Hop off on the Bayswater train station to get there.,,
,,A 21st Century Garden,5,,"It's like being a character of Avatar. Or an explorer that just landed in a strange land, filled with familiar plants, but all of them grouped in the most marvelous way. Never had seem a garden like that and I don't think I'll ever will see.",,
,,Amazing,5,,"Thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the gardens.....loads to see / take in so allow plenty time to enjoy it all. Highly recommend, whether you are into gardening / plants or not !",,
,,Absolutely captivating.,5,,"This place is wonderful, as everywhere you look it is a pleasure to the eye. My wife and I could not stop talking about it We spent most of the day there and were worn out by the time we returned to our hotel.",,
,,A must see in Singapore,5,,"This place has it all. The flower dome,the Cloud dome, spectacular electric trees and a light show tha twill leave you smiling. Try the tree walk, Its only $8 pp and amazing views from ahigh. The gardens themselves will take you all day to wander through. Make use of the cheap courtesy cart to get from one end to the other if you have issues walking. Taxis will drop you next the the cloud dome to start your exploring.",,
,,Must see when in SG!,5,,"Best to visit in the afternoon and stay until night to watch the performance after. Awesome tricks on lights accompanied by soothing music from different countries. SG is one of my favorite country. Will definitely be back. Ooops by the way, best to be in your most comfortable attire when strolling.",,
,,You should NOT MISS OUT ON THIS PLACE,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is not your typical garden, greenhouse, or whatever you call it. This place is PEACEFUL and SUPERB. I can't say enough how this place amazed me when I arrived inside. Be prepared though as there's a lot of people inside, especially during the weekends. It's quite hard to take a selfie without a lot of heads on your background! LOL. Overall, this place is amazing and really a must-visit when you're in Singapore. The ticket to visit the two conservatories is $28 SGD and $20 SGD for local residents/people with valid working visa in SG.",,
,,Beautiful gardens ..huge,4,,The gardens are huge ..half a day and I saw 2 conservatories and super trees and had dinner.Children playground great for children.There are also free gardens you can see if not entering conservatories plus night show at super trees is free as well.,,
,,Worth a visit,4,,Walked there on a very hot day. The gardens etc are well laid out. There is a good cafe /restaurant within the complex. A bit annoying that prices were $8 for residents and $36 for non residents to enter some of the sections.,,
,,A dream come true,5,,A place you will never forget. I can鈥檛 say enough about how much I love it. There is an stoppable source of peaceful energy that makes yourself to want to stay here. Unforgettable experience in an unbelievable beautiful place!,,
,,Amazing!,5,,"This is a MUST see in Singapore. The gardens are truly exceptional, and it's lovely to be in the cool mist on a hot day. A really amazing attraction on a grand scale.",,

,,Visit to Gardens by the Bay,4,,Great visit but pretty crowded during weekend. Need to take leave to visit during week day. Withered plants may be replaced or removed.,,
,,"Beautiful few hours spent here, different world zones of plants",5,,"if you are in Singapore spend a few hours here.
We were there when they had the cherry blossom which was popular with the Japanese, who were in traditional costume.
Made a lovely photo opportunity.
Different world zones so you can see some unusual plants too.
Theres a Cafe plus plenty of facilities.
Mcdonalds is there too!
We spend a lovely time here",,
,,Impressive and huge,4,,"It's one of those mandatories visits if you are touristing for the first time in Singapore. Everyone goes, why wouldn't you?
It is not something that you'll remember as a highlight of your trip but it is definitely impressive and it is beautiful. Prepare to walk and spend at least 3 hours in the area. It is a massive place there are plenty to see and you might need some stops to recover your breath. If you have small kids like we do, go prepared with a change of clothes for the kids and towels and don't miss the Children's Garden, it is awesome!",,
,,Amazing,5,,"Beautiful flowers, and sculptures must stay the day and night as the night show is brilliant, best view from the sky walk at the top of the super trees however if you are afraid of heights I would not recommend that one. It is an additional 8SDG and note the last admission is 8pm.

Lots to eat , do and see so suggest you get there early around 10am to take your time and enjoy the day into night.",,
,,"Beautiful place, must see!",4,,"Super trees and flower domes are so beautiful. We did not buy tickets to go in, just spend 1-2 hrs walk around in the garden and it is attractive enough for us. I think it is a must place to visit if you come to Singapore.",,
,,So soothing and relaxing,5,,"The place was so nice, there are a children鈥檚 park which was so beautiful. So many types of trees, like the greenery and freshness . The light show and skywalk at evening was splendid. It鈥檚 an amazing place .",,
,,Beautifully Presented,4,,I wouldnt rush back but I think this is a must see for all tourists to the island state. Not expensive and lots to see.,,
,,Lovely wander around the gardens totally beautiful,5,,"I really enjoyed this visit, we walked from our hotel via the city link and follows the signs. Really beautiful, amazing trees and planting. We saw hundreds of carp in a pond some were enormous. We paid to walk the sky walk between the giant trees it鈥檚 a brilliant view of the extensive gardens and the Marina Sands Hotel. Well worth a visit !",,
,,Lovely place,4,,A lovely to visit with kids they will enjoy it thoroughly.. the two domes are very nice but the waterfall and cloud dome is a definite must visit.. an amazing structure with nice cool controlled temperature inside.. it may get cool for the kids must plan to visit at about 6 in the evening so u can experience the lights also later on which are equally brilliant.. the flower done is good but can't compare with the waterfall one..the light show is amazing and one of a kind.. suggest u c from the top if possible..,,
,,A good half day with a return for the light show at night.,5,,"You don鈥檛 need to pay or ride the mini train to get around the gardens. Super trees are interesting and will be better when they are better covered in foliage (if the Singaporeans let nature go a little wider). Only costs are the walkway - good, and the domes which are excellent but quite expensive.",,
,,"Fantastic, a must see",5,,You will never see anything like it. If you are visiting Singapore you really need to pay this s visit.,,
,,Gardens by the bay,5,,Stunning gardens and grounds definitely worth a visit. Amazing view of marina bay sands from the sky walk. Flower dome was stunning and cloud done was well worth a look,,
,,Beautiful,5,,"I鈥檓 no Charlie Dimmock but these gardens are beautiful and serene. We spent about 5 hours just wandering, there鈥檚 so much to see and it鈥檚 incredible that this has been created in a city that鈥檚 so built up. Definitely worth a visit.",,
,,Beauty at its best,5,,The magnificent tree structures light up your pics. Was a lovely experience. The view from the Singapore Flyer is awesome,,
,,Great attraction,5,,"This is one of Singapore's best attraction and i would come back and do this again. A great way to get out of the heat as well, which is priceless in this city.",,
,,Amazing attraction!,5,,Flower dome never ceases to amaze me. Another great display of Sakura flowers. But I think last year was better. I was surprised to see attractive orchids at the Cloud Dome. I also liked The attraction at the basement of Cloud Dome.,,
,,Must do,5,,"One of my favourite parts of the trip. We didn't bother to pay to go into the domes as there is so much to see without doing this. We arrived about 5pm and took some great shots with the sun going down from the waters edge. We then headed to the children area. Bring your swimmers! This is amazing and we could have spent all day there.
We they walked up to Satay by the Bay for dinner and finished off with the light show. Out of this world!",,
,,Amazing,5,,It is very amazing to see such a beautiful garden in a very busy city. It is a very nice place to go to relax from the busy day. A must for tourist.,,
,,Very good and very satisfied!,5,,My visit on friday afternoon. Not very crowded since it wasn't peak season. Very beautiful and a lot of cool collection. Love the flower dome and the theme was tulips and a lot of beautiful tulips flower and variants of it,,
,,Must visit,5,,"Exceptional experience day or night. A must visit, well designed and something for the whole family. The night time light show must be seen, very clever. The Flower Halls are excellent and well presented. A1 on the must visit list.",,
,,Cloud Forrest,5,,To see the Gardens by the bay is free. Lights switch on every day at 7.45pm and absolutely beautiful in the night! Inside of this place you can buy tickets to see few things. We鈥檝e only done the Cloud Forrest.,,
,,An Excellent place for local and tourist,5,,"After so many years, this is my first time visit Garden by the bay and i am truly impress and love it.",,
,,beautiful gardens,5,,Beautiful and almost nature gardens especially the Super Groves. Sure man made gardens are unreal to believe it was all planted. The cloud forest are simply magnificent.,,
,,Excellemt,5,,"Visited Gardens by the Bay from recommendation and wasn't disappointed. I used the hop on hop off bus to ensure I didn't miss any of the city he knew where I wanted to visit. the area is huge but very clean,interesting and the two domes are air conditioned which is a good thing s Singapore is a humid place.",,
,,Visits,4,,Its is nice n fresh with the tulip exhibit. Would like to see more of this kind of exhibit. Weekends crowded,,
,,Lights turned off early!,3,,"Very disappointed! The one night we had a chance to see the Super Trees light up and they where only partially on, the website states open till 2am while the others close at 9pm. Otherwise the area in general during the day is beautiful and we visited the Cloud Forrest.",,
,,"Amazing place, but overcrowded",3,,"The weather was not so good, so we decided to wonder around the Gardens by the Bay. It is like Paradis. Amazing to see the variety of plants they organised in one place. I liked the Cloud Forest better then the flower Dome. The last one was overcrowded, and we could hardly move around, let alone to look at the flowers. Guess it depends on the time slot you are visiting. If you don't bother the crows, a good attraction.",,
,,beautiful indoor gardens and exhibits,5,,"If you only have a short time in Singapore then this is one place you should definitely visit. The ticket price is not too bad and the unique setup of multi-story indoor gardens with waterfalls and caves is well worth a few hours of your time. Be warned, it can get exceptionally crowded, but otherwise a great way to experience a wide variety of beautiful flowers, plants and artworks as well.",,
,,Tulipmania and children play area,4,,Good Tulip collections at flower dome and children had gala time at children water park. Kids enjoyed the play in water during the hot day.....,,
,,Garden by the Bay,5,,"One of the best attraction ever! theme change all year round, so if you ever visited in January, you might want to visit again in later part of the year!! Nice, cozy, cooling and it a big garden!!",,
,,Stunning,5,,Spent a lovely afternoon walking through the gardens then into the domes. Then went to Satay by the bay for some amazing food and returned for the light show which was fantastic. Great way to spend the day.,,
,,"Amazing scenery, but a little bit crowded still the staff managed it well",4,,"It is an air-conditioned place but you won't have a moment of bad odor even though there are a lot of people and crowded, it seemed very well ventilated. The items they have in displayed are unique and never been seen before - for mostly Asia (i reckon). It is a good visit if you have not been there before. You may visit during Christmas month as they have special decoration as well for the festive season.",,
,,Lovely temperate space,5,,Nice to step into a cool oasis of nature right in the middle of a largely-developed city. A vast variety of species - was pleased to see an entire section dedicated to the Agave plant. Worth a visit.,,
,,Wonderful!,5,,"Its a must do while your here.Time your visit to coincide with the fabulous light and sound show, and you wont be dissappointed!",,
,,A must see attraction,5,,"If you love plants and nature, you must pay a visit to this attraction. You can go twice if time allows,one in the morning and another one at night. You will enjoy this place especially with the cool air-conditioning.",,
,,Night Zoo amazing,5,,Best recommendation we had from friends. A great evening and amazed at how close you get to the animals.,,
,,Tulips at Gardens by the Bay,4,,Fascinating place - everything from Australian native plants to tulips from Amsterdam - we wandered around at our own pace and just loved it. Staff were helpful and friendly. We prepaid at our hotel and did not have to wait in line although the queues did seem to move quite fast.,,
,,A must for anyone going yo singapore.,5,,Going there was most attractive for me when seeing from the internet but going there is something spectacular especially at night .,,
,,Extraordinary,5,,"If you like nature and science, this is the place to go. A must visit in the evening. Be there at 19:45 an watch. Be a half an hour before, to get your self a place ;)",,
,,Singapore Star Attraction,5,,"Visitors to Singapore's Garden by the Bay cannot but be awed by the mega garden domes and majestic supertree structures. The garden which covers nearly 101 hectares of reclaimed land is divided into different areas of which the Flower Dome, the Cloud Forest, the Skyway and Supertree Grove are the most popular. Be prepared to spend at least half a day or more exploring this magnificent garden, and if possible, see the garden especially the Supertree Grove in the evening when the structures comes alive in glowing colours.
Built against the backdrop of one of Singapore's most iconic hotels, the Marina Bay Sands, this garden is truly a must see attraction for all visitors to this little red dot called Singapore.",,
,,Very pleasant visit at our 1st day in Singapore,5,,We went there the 1st day of our visit in Singapore. It was good decision. We were impressed by the way how this gardens are builded. It鈥檚 nice and beatufil place of nature which I wouldn鈥檛 expect to see in Singapore. Very nice place to walk an relax out of the busy city near by. Especialy nice is the music and light performance in the evenning.,,
,,Loved being here!,5,,This is a wonderful place to go and worth every penny of tickets spent here!! Please do not miss 7.45 PM (and repeated 8.45 PM) light show at supertree grove. This is free and worth it!,,
,,"Even if you aren't a Nature Lover, Visit This Wonder. Singapore sets a Benchmark!",5,,"Gardens by the Bay - will simply Awe you, may be even shock you.
The are various conservatories that are interesting and will keep tourists engaged. Singapore as a country is truly leading the way in terms of responsible tourism, educative tourism and entertainment.

The place will educate you and give you lot of perspective of how beautiful and amazing planet earth is, and where we are headed due to the hectic pace of modern living.

Kids will enjoy too. Go without expectations. Spend at least 4-6 hours there. Post 3.30pm should be a right time to visit the Gardens.

Good luck.-
Aby Baldota",,
,,Impressive light show!,4,,"What an awesome night light show! When you arrive at the drop off area, head up the staircase on the left to the OCBC Skyway and Supertree Grove (via the World of Palms). It's great they have lifts on the sides of the staircases. Once you arrive at the Grove, just pick a comfortable place to sit/stand and wait for the announcement that the show is to begin. Great light and sound co-ordination - with all your favourite movie themes - it's a lovely way to spend the evening - with Marina Bay Sands in the background! Recommended for all ages to enjoy.",,
,,Wow,5,,The real natural form of trees and plants for people who now plants this is there activity try the audio tour it is better than walking,,
,,Flower dome,5,,The gardens at the bay are a free walk around but the flower dome is a pay visit but well worth while....two domes both different and regularly change but worth the visit. The flowers are amazing and waterful great fun.,,
,,Good to spend time with friends to walk around such amazing garden,4,,It is cool and comfortable to walk inside the in house garden and see various types of plants and taking photos with friends. It is suitable for family and knowledge gain for kids. It is an amazing project to convert such green idea into tourist spot.,,
,,"Don't expect too much, please...",4,,"From all the photos, reviews and feedback I gathered before going on here, they were too good to be true.
Altough I would rate the place as 8/10 due to it's cleanliness, wide area to explore, accessible and fun. Aside from it, I was disappointed to the flower tower as I may call it. I went there around 4pm to roam around the area and waited until 8pm since all lights and sound effect shows starts at this time. When the show started, the lights effects was not as I was expecting.It was somewhat lack of extravagance in terms of lights and all. This is just my opinion.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,We had an afternoon here and thoroughly enjoyed it. We could have spent much longer. Done beautifully. So much to look at and cool.,,
,,Stunning night view,4,,"The Gardens by the Bay is a nice place for kids to play around and enjoy their time, at night the lights of the trees looks beautiful. There is a HALAL Texas' Chicken restaurant around the area. You can enjoy your lunch there.",,
,,Amazing!,5,,Must visit place while in singapore! Easily to go via MRT. Nice place to walk around day and night! The Gardens by the bay Rhapsody is so amazing we watched it twice! 馃檪馃懀,,
,,Splendid,5,,"Gardens by The Bay is an amazing nature park, a perfect way to get in touch with the nature in the midst of the city.The massive Supertrees covered with ferns and vines, mimics ecological functions of trees. The lights and music show at night (7:45 pm) was splendid. The two conservatories also showcases a sustainable building technologies. The Cloud Forest offers a refreshing indoor waterfall and lush garden artistry. During our visit, the sakura were among the featured flowers at the Flower Dome. The collection of plants and flowers were beautiful and captivating. The Far East Organization Children's Garden was closed during our visit. There are restaurants and gift shops around the area.",,
,,Beautiful and quiet,5,,No expense has been spared in creating these gardens .They are a necessary part for such a densely populated city.The domes were exceptional with the display of tulips.Worth the entry fee.,,
,,Another stunning Singapore achievement,5,,"Singapore can still produce amazing concepts, whether it is a building or a garden. An amazing collection of plants from all around the world in a magnificent environment.
Just overcome with the cages to plan the trees growth to maturity. To walk around the garden gives you a rewarding experience",,
,,Must place to visit in Singapore,5,,This is a must place to visit when anyone visits Singapore. Cloud Forest is exceptionally well maintained and totally new concept. Flower Dome is equally fascinating. My entire family loved this place..!!,,
,,Beautiful place to visit,5,,My husband and I decided to visit and it was beyond our expectations! They have done such a great job and it appears there has been no expense spared on the gardens. The flower dome and cloud forest were certainly worth the money spent and it was nice to get away into the air condition from the hot humid outdoors.,,
,,Fresh Air,5,,"Nice place to see flower from other country. Cool and fresh air. You can study many about tree, flower and earth.",,
,,Amazing light and sound show!,5,,"We went there in late afternoon, and could have gone a lot earlier in order to see everything there. Very interesting concept, and beautiful at night.",,
,,Dead Heart where Flowers Bloom,2,,"The exterior looks quite impressive, while the variety of plants is commendable. The tulip display at the Flower Dome is pretty nice.

But service here is horrible. Some try, but many others seem tired, irritable, and in some cases, quite cold. In open, public areas of a garden (with no exotic plant species around), my toddler was stopped from playing bubbles because 鈥渙thers may be sensitive to it鈥? At the cloud forest, another toddler was not allowed to enter because she was drinking milk from a tiny uht packet (staff said if she was drinking from a milk bottle it was ok). If the fear was of littering, it could be better managed with bins - many of the tourists had brought in all sorts of food and drinks in their bags anyway, and often paused to consume them.

Another pet peeve as an Asian, and even more so as a Singaporean - some service staff seem to favor Caucasian visitors more, which in this day and age, is ridiculous.

Finally, as a safety issue, the pedestrian/jogging track behind the two domes often had speeding escooters and bicycles entering the track when the vehicle lane had the tour buggy/team on it. And seeing how many visitors kinda saw the area as an enclosed space, it was quite understandable that some stray into the vehicle and bicycle lanes, and may not be aware of the escooters and bicycles coming at them at full speed from behind. Some policing or better demarcation should be made.

All-in-all, a disappointing visit.",,
,,truly awesome & breathtaking.,5,,"one of the top attractions & a must see & do in SINGAPORE . the Gardens by the Bay, located behind the iconic Marina Bay Sands & accessible via the Bayfront MRT station. the OCBC Skyway offers a breathtaking, awesome, magnificent view of the gardens 22 metres above the ground. it also housed the Flower Dome & Cloud Forest where over 1 million types of plants are found here in an indoor cool forest, some of which are not found in this part of the world. don鈥檛 forget to witness the lights show every night at 19:45 & 20:45 & be mesmerized & thrilled by the colorful & spectacular lights show.",,
,,Nice view,3,,"Good to see, but I think no need to buy ticket, just buy ticket for marina bay skypark, view is awesome from there",,
,,"Crowded, but worth it",5,,"This is an amazing feat ... beautiful gardens in a dome, with breathtaking waterfall and powerful climate change message. My husband and I wondered if in the future this will be the only way we can capture and experience nature. Hope not. The grounds surrounding, the giant trees, the waterfront, mall, and all were a great. Day out in Singapore",,
,,Simply stunning!,5,,"What a fantastic experience- light show, music, busy, bustling entertainment area in the most tranquil surroundings. A MUST do experience in delightful Singapore!",,
,,Gardens by the bay,5,,A very good place to spend 1/2 a day or even a full day. The garden are very big and we enjoyed walking through so much of it.,,
,,This was worth the visit!,5,,"Amazingly kitschy outing with actual biodomes like from the Paul Shore movie. Just as wacky too really - LEGO Venus fly traps, giant clogs, aboriginal art. It鈥檚 a fun and nicely air conditioned experience!",,
,,Wow! Breathtaking.,5,,A review can鈥檛 do this justice. It is a must see when you visit Singapore. Everything is incredible. The garden rhapsody night light show was the highlight of my trip.,,
,,Wow Wow Wow!,5,,"After seeing the image of the Gardens by the Bay within a David Attenborough documentary, I have been looking forward to seeing it in real life and wow it did it not disappoint. There are 2 Domes within the Gardens, the flower and the cloud. Tickets are priced at $28 to visit both Domes. Though they are both wonderful, I feel like the flower dome will only be truly appreciated by flower enthusiasts but they range of flowers are impressive! The cloud dome however I feel everyone will enjoy, especially from the stunning waterfall that greets you as you enter from the high canopy views!

Away from the Domes are the iconic supertrees. They are truly spectacular, and is worth paying for the Skywalk to walk among the trees up high. However one of my highlights is when night fallst, and the light show takes place among the trees. The sound and colours are amazing, and just sitting under the trees enjoying the spectacle is something very unique.

If you're visiting Singapore, then this is a certain must see. I don't feel you need to be a flower enthusiast to enjoy it as i certainly did!",,
,,Fabulous,5,,"If you appreciate flora and fauna this is the place for you. The displays are breathtaking in the domes. It is well worth returning in the evening for the light display, another amazing experience. Not to be missed",,
,,Not my scene,3,,"Although a major Singapore attraction, I am not into gardens and flowers so did not enjoy the flower dome. The cloud forest was good and the skywalk between the trees was great.",,
,,Really nice but a bit expensive,4,,"Lovely gardens and the evening light and sound show is well worth staying for. At $28 it does seem a bit expensive, though. You only have to pay if you go inside the climate controlled domes, so I guess you could just skip those if you wanted to save money.",,
,,Fantastic place,5,,We have just got back from visiting here and we鈥檙e very impressed. The two domes are amazing with waterfalls and beautiful plants and they had a tulip display which was excellent. Strangely cool inside too which is a welcome relief from the humid weather outside! Well worth a visit,,
,,lifetime experience,5,,"The whole setup of these gardens from the domes to the towering ""trees"" to the fascinating figures is a tourist's delight. The night light show is spectacular and should rate as a bucket list must see!",,
,,Do this!,5,,"If you do nothing else in Singapore you must visit the Gardens by the bay - they are amazing, we went first at night to watch the light show and then visited the next day to take in the cloud forest, flower dome, and gardens I can't praise this attraction enough it's fantastic !! It's worth the long flight just to visit here.",,
,,Awesome,5,,"It s best to go in the evening as there is a show. It s really awesome. It s free unless you want to visit flower dome or cloud forests. If you wish to visit the dome, best to go during day time as it cools you done inside the dome. You can take MRT to Bayfront station. There is a bridge linking between the garden and Marina bay sands.you can see beautiful view and can take a good photo shot.",,
,,Well worth the effort,5,,"One of the highlight of the Singapore visit, even though its a tough walk from the Mariner Bay Sands under the repressive afternoon heat and humidity. The Flower Dome and The Cloud Forest are very impressive, highly recommended for everyone",,
,,"Paradise, plants and a light show.",4,,"The setting is sublime, so many different types of plants and succulents from all around the world a feast for the eyes. There are 2 domes which were amazing. Lots of beautiful trees and walkways and the lighting at night is spectacular. It was busy but not overtly.

We went there as part of a conference and the conference area was a big letdown one tiny little bar making trying to get a drink when there is 1000 people a tad challenging.

The gardens however are at standing on something not to be missed if you are visiting Singapore.",,
,,Nature and Man in Harmony,5,,"Really easy to get to using the MRT Underground system. Travel to Bayfront station and then at the exit barriers head down the tunnel that is signposted to the Gardens.

A 5 minute stroll and then up some stairs and you meet a very friendly and helpful guide who will give you a free map and direct you to the main attractions in the Gardens.

The Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are stunning and then you simply have to do the Skyway walk in the Supertree Grove. Tickets to the two domes and the Skyway are not cheap but the experiences are worth the entry fees.

There is a time limit applied to the Skyway but you should have enough time to take photos and admire the view in the time allocated.The guide on the Skyway will even take photos of you with your phone or camera!

Then after you've spent a couple of hours in the Gardens you can walk across Dragonfly bridge, up some escalators, then along the walkway into Marina Bay Sands hotel and another experience...",,
,,Top of the 鈥渢o do鈥?list!,5,,What a beautiful experience. Especially with the Tulips on display until 13th May. The best time to arrive is around 4-5.00 pm. This gives you plenty of time to enjoy the experience of the flower dome and the cloud forest. By 7:30 you should be ready to take your seat on the steps in the Supertree Grove for the light and sound show. Or line up to walk the OCBC Skyway. There is a great rooftop bar in one of the Supertrees. On a warm balmy night it鈥檚 lovely to sit and enjoy the rooftop view with a glass of wine.,,
,,Amazing gardens in a beautiful setting,5,,"The gardens by the bay are a must see if you are visiting Singapore. We visited twice during our week long stay with an evening and day visit, which are recommended especially given the magnificent lights during the evening. We were captivated by the cloud forest, which is an awesome experience and were lucky enough to enjoy the tulip festival. The area is vast and crowds did not really impact our visit. The area is accessible by the MRT and taxi, which are cheap transport options in Singapore.",,
,,Stunning,5,,"The setting is breathtaking, and the two domes take it to new levels. The range of plants and trees is amazing, everything from succulents found in the arrid regions to rainforest, including the amazing waterfall.",,
,,Worth the trip,4,,"These gardens are beautiful. I reckon this to everyone. Everyone in the family, children, teenagers and adults, all enjoyed this trip.",,
,,Looks like the Future,5,,The first view from the Marina Bay Sands lets you know you have arrived in a very modern city. It looks like a Holly wood conception of a future world on Mars.,,
,,Incredible Exeperience,5,,The gardens are beautifully set out and arranged with sections relating to regions across the globe. A stunning seasonal section was dedicated to cherry blossom which was amazing. One thing that did catch us out slightly was the gardens are climate controlled and coming in from the humid outside made you feel quite chilly so if you are spending a fair amount of time there you may want to take another thin clothing layer especially if you have children.,,
,,Jaw-dropping,5,,"This is quite a landmark and worth the visit for nature and plant-lovers. It鈥檚 a bit odd to have two massive covered terrariums in a tropical place but it does bring the rest of the world鈥檚 plants to Singapore and does so as sustainably as possible. The Cloud Forest is astounding. The second garden is beautiful as well, however, both have a bit of a theme-park artificiality that detracts (some of the sections/exhibits are too staged for my liking, but I鈥檓 splitting aesthetic hairs). Oddly, the California section was oddly unremarkable and a bit ratty compared to the rest of the gardens. Definitely worth a visit!",,
,,Unique view,4,,"During the visit to Gardens by the Bay, we did not pay for any tickets except SGD8 per person to visit OCBC Skyway. Supertree grove is a stunning thing to view. The idea to come out with the gardens resembling towering trees really impressed us. Other than this, there are different gardens with various themes such as Indian, Malay, Chinese and Colonial Gardens. Besides, there are also a mall and casino for different enjoyment.

At night, with the lights on, the building looks more attractive and amazing! Whoever goes to Singapore should pay a visit here.",,
,,Highlights the city's beauty,5,,"I was impressed with Singapore for its natural beauty even in an urban area. There was an abundance of natural landscapes throughout the city, and Gardens by the Bay just topped it off wonderfully. It is well worth the visit here.",,
,,Tranquil peaceful beautiful,4,,"Beautiful place. Its man made, but still quite beautiful and tranquil. The waterfall is awesome and seems natural. The huge trees are a spectacle not to be missed",,
,,Beautiful Flowers and Landscaping !!,5,,"We were here to admire the Tulips !

The Tulipmania is from 13 April 2018 and 13 May 2018 and the Flower Dome is filled with colourful and beautiful Tulips with descriptions of myriad types of Tulips.

It is helpful to have the descriptions as it not only allows you to enjoy the Tulips and also to know more about it !

The landscaping of the Flower Dome is amazing by bringing out the ambience of the Tulips as though you are in Netherlands !

Another outstanding attraction is the Cloud Forest. Once you have entered it, you are greeted by the awesome waterfall ! Take your time to immense with the replicate of the Forest at different levels and also to enjoy the scenic view of Marina Bay along the way !!

OCBC card holders can enjoy 15% discount of the tickets, be sure to ask whether it is still valid during your visit.

Lastly, you may wish to get the exclusive Tulips design magnet for this exhibition as a souvenir to remember your happy moments in the Flower Dome :)",,
,,Why should foreigners be charged a different entrance fee,3,,I think it鈥檚 absolutely wrong that foreigners are charged a much higher entrance fee to visit Gardens by the Bay. In my opinion it鈥檚 discrimination.,,
,,Lovely place,4,,Nice gardens and a lot of things to do and to See. Nice childrens Garden But unfortunatly it is closed on mondays,,
,,Fantastic place,5,,This is a great place for relaxing. Due to the big size it doesn't feel crowded. The only invonvenience is the heat.,,
,,Stunning landscape,5,,"Amazing views and stunning man made landscapes.Although is entirely man made,the place is really wonderful.You can just simply walk or jogging.A splendid place.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay,4,,"Its a huge garden and can take 3-4hrs to cover at a reasonable pace. The highlight of this place is the cloud forest, which is a must visit. It also has a flower dome which i felt was a little over rated. But overall its a good tourist attraction to visit with the entire family.",,
,,Fantastic,5,,"We spent a late afternoon here to see the domes and watch the light show.
Amazing, how spectacular.
Only tip if travelling via taxi back to hotel, do not go to entrance as you will wait and wait with all the crowds. Go towards the Marina MRT station. Out the front of Marina Bay hotel Taxis were plentiful.",,
,,Love this place - a must see,5,,"One the last day my twin nieces were in town I decided to bring them to Gardens by the bay.

I love how beautifully this attraction has been both built and maintained. Walking around the waterfall feature was lovely.

There was a short movie playing downstairs that was worth staying for as well.

If you're coming to Singapore - it is well worth a visit",,
,,So beautiful,5,,"I visited Gardens by the Bay a few time. It was a good place to chill with friends, relax and enjoy the music.",,
,,Awesome xperience,5,,"What a great morning or day out.
Beautiful gardens. Plants from around the world in a biosphere.
Loved the cherry blossom display and Japanese exhibition.
Loved seeing Australian natives and hybrids presented in a glorious manner.
You may need a sarong or long sleeves to keep warm.
Great tower in the second dome.
Fantastic waterfall and flowers flowers trees and shrubs, loved it.
Food was ok too outside the domes.",,
,,Always something attracting ...,5,,"Garden by the Bay is one of the always happening places in Singapore . Apart from typical usual stuff they have , they try to keep something happening every part of the year. My girl and I normally have mommy baby date in this area. Musical lights is one of the things which we never miss.",,
,,More Like Theatre By The Bay,5,,Whether you are a gardener or not this place should not be missed. The range of plants is broad but the method of presentation is absolutely top class. Stay around for the evening light show and enjoy the wonderful feeling of a happy and contented crowd as you leave. It's magic!!,,
,,Absolutely fantastic!,5,,"Highly recommend. A visit to Singapore without going here would incomplete. Beautiful free gardens, sculpture and the two bidomes are also worth paid admission. The cloud forest especially. The free evening light show was spectacular. Take sturdy shoes, a camera, water and enjoy!",,
,,Beautiful with plenty of art,5,,"A glorious way to spend a day! Gardens, art, water, what more does anyone need? Incredible beauty and serenity.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"Spent the whole of Sunday here. So beautiful, calm not crowded so many fabulous things to see and do. Highly highly recommended.",,
,,Flower,5,,Very pretty place to visit with family and friends along marina bay sands hotel as well a good venue to tour for foreigner friends... Fresh flower all over the world..Very relaxing and amaze with the variety of flower plants at the 2 dome,,
,,Amaizing place.,5,,Very beautiful and amaizing place... If anyone visiting Singapore this place should me in the list of their must visit places.,,
,,Loved it!!,5,,"We loved it here! We could have spent all day wondering around! So many different gardens and interesting displays. The cloud forest was our favourite, that was so special to walk around, unlike anything else we鈥檝e ever been too. The tulipmania display was beautiful. This is a must see in Singapore!",,
,,Absolutely Magical,5,,This place was unlike anywhere I鈥檝e ever been! Not only was it beautiful but it made me feel calm - we thoroughly enjoyed our day here!,,
,,An amazing place,5,,We took the kids and thought it would be a quick visit. We were so wrong! Our kids 6 and 8 loved it. The domes were beautiful and educational (we hired the audio tour) and the super trees were magestic. The kids area with sprinklers and adventure activities were great and the kids would live there if we let them!!!!!! The little cafe near the sprinklers was cheap and had great kids snacks.,,
,,Go during the day,4,,"The place is open up until 2am, due to lack of time we couldn't really visit during day time but we went at night. Told by many, it's stunning by the day and absolutely magical",,
,,Magnificient,5,,This place is amazing. So much greenery. Looks like a beautiful jungle built up together a such a large space. So many beautiful and wonderful flowers. There are so many flowers which I never saw in my life. So beautiful love to visit this place again.,,
,,Recommended,5,,"This is a 鈥楳ust do鈥?when visiting Singapore, spectacular plants, setting etc. Reasonable priced ideal for all age groups.",,
,,Amazing,5,,"Got a chanc to see it properly. A lovely place to spend time in the immaculate place, serene and lovely",,
,,Fantastic Day in the Gardens,5,,"This is a must when you visit Singapore. The gardens are spectacular and represent plants from so many countries around the world. They have an audio tour of about 30 minutes that is very good and we would recommend that visitors do this as the gardens are so large it is hard to do all of it by foot.

They have two conservatories that are fantastic.

The Super Trees Grove is amazing, including the skywalk.

If visitors love taking photos then the Gardens are the place to go to.",,
,,Must not be missed,5,,"This is a quite remarkable tourist attraction which really defies description. For anyone with the remotest interest in plants, flowers and gardens we would strongly urge you not to miss a visit. The main garden is free to enter but do pay the fee to go into the domes - you will not be disappointed",,

,,"It's really ""Waaau"" and unique place!",5,,"We stayed here just 2-3 hours, but I would recommend to reserve little bit more time, If you want to have a lunch/ dinner, to have a walk in the gardens or explore skyway (count with extra fees and usually there is queue for this attraction ). We had that lucky that there was also some music & lights performance in the evening (not sure, but maybe they do it every day /or just during the weekend).",,
,,Wonderful experience,5,,"Amazing. Was able to see the tulip display which was unbelievable. Memories for a lifetime. Would go again, worth the cost.",,
,,Night time lights of the City,5,,The view from the City to the Gardens and vice versa are a must see for everyone. I would recommend this as a must do during the day and night. Its free too for just walking the ground so can't go wrong there!,,
,,"Spectacular in every way, stay for night light show",5,,"we arrived about 3.30pm. not that easy to walk to but worth it when finally there. Both domes are amazing. A cherry blossom display was lovely. A bar/cafe in the flower dome was very cold so we did not stay for a drink. (Maybe take a jacket or cardi here) We toured outside and secured a position to see light show early. The lights on the ""trees"" in various colours turn on/off to the music. Much better than fireworks!",,
,,Great free gardens with 2 domes with paid entrance,5,,Great fee gardens with lovely wet play area for children. Plenty of eating outlets - not cheap but ok. Worth paying for the two domes although younger children may not want to linger too long. The flower dome is a bit chilly so a wrap might be useful.,,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,A must see...for every visitor to Singapore. Unique creation that highlights the innovative approach of Singapore to provide great experiences for tourists. The sound & light show is outstanding. A good place to spend time for the entire family.,,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,"A fantastic day and night out in Singapore. The gardens are stunning and beautifully presented. The cloud forest and flower dome also provide a welcome air conditioned environment in Singapore鈥檚 heat. Stay for dinner at the Sky Garden and take in the light show, you will not be disappointed. The MRT is close and provides a convenient way to get to and from the area.",,
,,A must visit place when in Singapore,5,,"This place is just too beautiful. Much beyond one's imagination on creativity. A spectacular garden of flowers. The key attraction is Flower Dome and Cloud Dome. These are located inside the garden opposite each other. Entry to flower garden is free of cost while entry to these two domes are on a chargeable basis. However it's worth paying the entry fees for these two domes. Completely air-conditioned domes full of artificial flowers put up in a fantastic fashion.
Besides this , you can also visit OCBC skywalk (inside the garden on a chargeable basis). Do see the light show which is conducted two times a day and is very beautiful. This show is for about 15 minutes. You shud see the show from the open garden and not from OCBC skyway.",,
,,Unbelievable....a must see !!,5,,Truly amazing... elected to take a tour with RMG everything was trulyamazing. Certainly well planned and executed another great feature for Singapore. To avoid heat of the day try late afternoon or evening tour. certainly well worth the effort.,,
,,A must see when in Singapore,5,,"Absolutely loved the Gardens by the Bay....a wonderful design and such space. Both Domes are excellent I would suggest taking a light cardigan as they are very cool inside and I felt quite chilly. Worth the $S28 entrance fee and we spent about 3 hours there. Saw quite a lot of otters and a few water dragons as we walked by the water鈥檚 edge. Went back at night for the Light Show, again well worth seeing So pleased that the Gardens themselves are free ( you only pay for the Domes and Aerial walkway). Highly recommended. Also delighted to read that they were designed by a British Team!",,
,,Wow! Only in Singapore.,5,,"We had a morning at the gardens, its a great place to visit and escape the heat for a while. The water garden is spectacular, well worth the visit.",,
,,Truly amazing,5,,"Access to the Gardens by the Bay is free, however the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest is of charge but both are well worth the cost.
I made two trips, during the day and of an evening, specifically for the Garden Rhapsody at the Supertree Grove, a spectacular light and Sound show.
The gardens were absolutely stunning as was the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest!",,
,,Amazing,5,,"Definitely I must do, unless you can stand the heat go late afternoon into early evening that way you will see the gardens during the day and light show at night",,
,,Flora Bonanza,5,,"Together with The Botanical Garden, it is amazing the herculean task the Singaporeans managed to create and maintain such wonderful natural heritage. Ancient trees, lush greenery, bedding plant ... all well cared for. A healthy breathing green lung right at the heart of this amazing southeast Asian city!",,
,,Beautiful to visit at night,5,,"I visited at night as I was in town alone and had time to spare. It is a lovely place to go for a walk and enjoy the various plants. the gem is the supertrees, which at night were lit and there was even a music and light show which was a fantastic show and a highlight of the evening. Definitely worth a visit.",,
,,Completely amazing,5,,"Everyone told us this was a must visit attraction while in Singapore & would have to agree 100%. We were totally amazed at the the display of fauna & flora in the Flower Dome, & the sheer size of the Cloud Dome & it鈥檚 displays was beyond words- I don鈥檛 think the dozens of photos will do it justice.
But the absolute star of the night was the sound& lights display in the Flower Trees - the area was packed with people & everyone seemed thoroughly enchanted with the show.
The 2 domes were well worth the admission fee but to think the Flower Trees area is free to the public is a credit to the governing bodies.
Definitely a 鈥渕ust see鈥?experience & would go again at the first opportunity.",,
,,Great light show.,5,,Must see the evening light show. What a great spectacle and it's all free. Food in the park a bit pricey...,,
,,Lovely place,5,,Lovely place to roam in and view the beautiful surroundings of the gardens. You can enjoy most of the places for free. Food at the restaurant cafe was actually reasonably priced as well..,,
,,A must see!,5,,This beautiful garden made up of hundreds of acres is a must see for any visitor or local! Special over the next month is the tulip festival! One of the most beautiful displays of flowers in the world! Don鈥檛 miss it!,,
,,Nice concept.,4,,The man-made trees are very beautiful and eco-friendly. Everyday @ 7:45 the light and music show happens in this place.,,
,,great for a quick day trip,4,,"in middle of city, if it's your first time to Singapore, its one of the must. It's manmade tho, but you can go to flower dome and cloud dome which is nice relief from city rush!",,
,,Not To Be Missed,5,,"Super Tree light show is amazing. Everyone we show video to is stunned. Cloud Forest is truly unique and so much to see it's hard not to miss something. We took MRT from our Chinatown hotel to directly across from the park and there are walkways so traffic is not an issue. Plan for a full day to include the grounds, conservatories and light show. Food and drink trucks are about the grounds and especially for the show. Pick your seat early and enjoy the crowd. It does fill up for the show. I'd allow at least a couple of hours for the Cloud Forest -- neat stuff tucked away everywhere.",,
,,Amazing,5,,A must to see when visiting Singapore especially at night.Allow at least 2 to 3 hours when visiting Gardens by the Bay finishing with the night lights,,
,,Must watch it,4,,We had a nice enjoyment of watching different kinds of plants n flowers. We went for ocbc skywalk. We booked tickets through online so that we got some offers n saved some dollars.,,
,,Extraordinary,5,,"We were just amazed by the Gardens by the Bay. Singapore has created a beautiful, vertical green space for all to enjoy. This area even generates revenue from people who 鈥渨alk among the trees鈥?

The views from the walkways are truly beautiful and we will never forget this incredible experience.",,
,,AMAZING!!!,5,,I absolutely loved the gardens by the bay! It is so so so beautiful. I have traveled a good amount and it is one of my favorite things I have ever seen. There is a light show on the water by the mall and it was stunning! The mall is gorgeous. The city as a whole is unbelievably clean and the people are extremely nice!,,
,,A great way to spend the afternoon,5,,This is a very relaxing and wonderful place to spend an afternoon and early evening visiting. Why so late you may ask? Well there is a amazing light show centred on the 'super trees' in the gardens that is well worth staying around for. The domes have an amazing array of plants and flowers even for a non-gardener like me.,,
,,Wow-Nuts place!,5,,"What crazy person dreamt this up? You really have to see this place at night. The light shows are fun, though the music choice is a bit hokey. But just seeing these giant trees lit up is spectacular. Looks like something out of an alien planet in Star Trek. Highly recommended.",,
,,"Banal, ostentatious",2,,"Made the long-ish trip to Gardens by the Bay at the end of the day, just before the light show was set to begin. It's a bit ridiculous to be honest, just giant metal scaffolds shaped like trees that light up to songs. It's a like a Vegas attraction. The show I saw was called Journey through Asia, and they played four Chinese songs and one Indian song, so I suppose Japan, Thailand, etc., don't exist for the purposes of this absurd attraction. If you are staying in the area, check it out I suppose, but the Botanical gardens are far more interesting. Three stars of five because there really isn't much to do in Singapore in general, and it appears to have been expensive to construct. This would be one star if it was in Tokyo",,
,,An amazing location. Almost like you are in the movie Avatar,5,,"Lots to see and do here. Amazing architecture as well as flora to see.

Lots of walks, gardens, sculptures, eateries, buses, bikes and general fun to be had here.

Night or day there is plenty of people and it is an easy walk from the bay marina shopping centre.",,
,,Must Visit,5,,"This is a must do when you visit Singapore. It's fantastic during the day with all the things to see and do but magically transforms at night to something spectacular. I have visited every time we have been to Singapore.

Its great that Singapore had the foresight to retain this land and transform it into the tourist attraction that it is.

If you want something to eat walk across to nearby Satay by the Bay for a value for money feed.",,
,,Great place to go,5,,"This is a must go when in Singapore. The gardens are free to enter but you have to pay for the 2 pavilions but they are worth it. The variety, the colours, the layout is fantastic. There are many places to eat also including satay by the bay which is definitely worth to go to.",,
,,Excellent Experience,5,,What an amazing experience...a must do attraction. Make sure you have plenty of time to go through the two domes before viewing the light show in the gardens at night. This was definitely a highlight of Singapore. We were there when the tulips display was on....simply amazing.,,
,,Enchantig trip,5,,"This was one of the hightlights of our trip. Walking through the gardens was such an experience. Even though there were lots of people, it really was well managed. All ages really found something to admire here.",,
,,Fantastic and Amazing,5,,"My husband and I visited recently and the Cherry Blossom was in full bloom which was an added attraction to this already amazing place.

The variety of plants is enormous and I have no idea how plants from all different climates can coexist in a single temperature controlled environment.

If you only see one thing in Singapore I recommend you visit Gardens by the Bay.",,
,,fell in love with the sakura,5,,it was a Sunday afternoon when we went there and the place was jampacked with people. We could hardly have a decent picture inside but i fell in love seeing the Cherry Blossoms. AC was still good even if there were so much people inside. A must place to visit when in Singapore.,,
,,Fun day at Gardens by the Bay,4,,"I went solo for this activity. Great way to spend a couple of hours. A lot to see, take pictures, and take in all the beauty of nature. Recommended solo, couples, family.",,
,,Exquisite and unique gardens,5,,Singapore has created a mustsee attraction on this reclaimed land. While the design is wonderful the two climate controlled domes and supertrees make this Garden unique. Do not miss this one.,,
,,Beautiful place to visit,5,,What a delightful place to explore. Well cared for and manicured gardens with plenty to do. We walked around at 10.30pm at night and felt perfectly safe. Captured some amazing photos too.,,
,,Pure paradise and naughty cactuses,5,,"Went in because it started raining and what great decision it was.
We really enjoyed it, a botanical garden is not smth I do regularly.
An hour is enough to cover it, unless you decided to stop at the Pollen cafe inside for a great organic coffee and excellent deserts. They don鈥檛 have lactose-free and gluten-free options btw.",,
,,Lovely place to visit,5,,What a lovely place to go for a walk and enjoy the creativity of the garden designers. Next time will definitely return for a night visit to see the light show.,,
,,"Leisurely, three days required to see the gardens",4,,"The Gardens can be explored in a day if you are not travelling with senior citizens or children and if you are selective of which gardens you want to see.

We spent 1.5 days, and it wasn't enough time. On the first day, we had friends drop us off at the front main entrance (drop off/pick-up for taxis, coaches, etc) and we explored the main attractions - Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest for a fee. If you don't like cool/chilly air, bring a cardigan.

On the second day we arrived by the back entrance - by train to Bayfront MRT station - then a 10-minute walk to the Gardens by the Bay transit hub. From here, you can walk (about 10-15 minutes) or take a S$3/pax shuttle (unlimited, all day) ride to Flower Dome/Cloud Forest.

We bought tickets for the Audio shuttle tour (includes complimentary shuttle in, but return you have to either walk it or pay $3 for the shuttle back to the transit hub) for an overview of the gardens, which is a great introduction to how extensive and different the gardens are and should be the first thing to do (we opted to do this on the second day).

The night light and sound show at the Supergrove trees is 15 minutes long and you should be seated facing the tallest of the trees (where there is a rooftop bar at the top). The Skyway was closed because of weather, so we ended up paying S$12/pax for a soft drink and access to the rooftop bar (Level 16) for the view before going down to see the light show.

After the light show, there is an exodus of people. The taxi queue was very long (looking at a one-hour wait), so use a ride-hailing app (no queue for this). We waited about 15 minutes, the driver had to navigate through a traffic jam to reach us (where cars drop-off passengers).",,
,,maybe not for you if you are from Europe...,3,,Many of the plants on 'display' or from European and/or Western Regions and consequently the temperature in the facility is a bit chill (be aware when going in with little children),,
,,Lovely,5,,"Great time strolling around, with our two young children in strollers. Lifts/ramps make everything accessible. At first it was raining but even then it was lovely. Cloud forest was really interesting and the tulip exhibition and flower dome was really cool. Great way to spend a couple hours or so.",,
,,Amazing light display. Could have sat there all night.,5,,"The gardens were absolutely beautiful. So clean/no litter anywhere to be seen. I did not enter any of the facilities but went to super tree grove . I went up to one of the tree-top bars which had an entrance fee but this included a drink and the views were beautiful.
The light show was amazing. There were so many people seated to watch and the atmosphere was so good. Would definitely recommend a visit - the light show is also free admission!!",,
,,If you see one thing in Singapore- make it Gardens by the Bay!,5,,"Gardens by the bay is a huge, beautiful garden situated near Marina Bay. The garden features large structures known as 'Supertrees' as a focal point, and also 2 large domes known as the 'flower dome' and 'cloud forest' which you can visit for a fee. The gardens themselves are free to enter and walk around, and would have to be one of the top free attractions in Singapore. I highly reccomend walking from Marina Bay Sands Hotel on the beautiful elevated walkway towards the gardens- you will have an amazing photo oppurtunity! Hot tip- Check out Gardens by the bay in the mid to late afternoon, then stick around for the sound and light show in the evening. If you plan to do the 2 x Domes make sure you allow at LEAST 1 hr per dome. The cloud forest in particular is not a quick visit! I also recommend doing the skyway (an elevated skywalk between some of the supertrees) as you will get another amazing photo opportunity and one of the best views in Singapore!",,
,,Amazing place,5,,Wander round these amazing gardens and tree structures. Be sure to stay for the light show at 7.45pm - stunning.,,
,,Light show,3,,"We went to Gardens by the Bay twice in the evenings. There is a nice atmosphere during the light show, but the show itself is nothing special. The first time we went was quite late in the evening and we almost had the place to ourselves which was great as you can go at your own pace without it being packed. Worth seeing once if you're visiting Singapore for the first time.",,
,,Wow and amazing !!,5,,"All the reviews are right...this is an amazing place and a must see when in Singapore. Beautiful gardens manicured to perfection. Great light in evening, ww visited in evening and again during the day",,
,,Beautiful only at night,3,,"It鈥檚 a photographers dream to come here, come at night as it鈥檚 really beautiful to look at. It鈥檚 a small walk but worth it.",,
,,Fantastic,5,,I visited with my young family (18m & 4y old kids) very accessible with a buggy and staff all really helpful. Very well thought out. Although it seemed busy I didn't feel like I was jostling for space.,,
,,Cherry Blossoms in Singapore!,4,,Went to the Flower Dome during the Cherry Blossom festival. It was beautiful. Loved walking through the various regions and observing the different flowers and plants of the region.,,
,,They know how to make the city better,5,,The best time to see the place is the late afternoon when the facilities are still open and the evening when the flashing installations create a unique 鈥淎vatar-like鈥?experience.,,
,,Amazing,5,,"Thoroughly enjoyable experience. The Cloud Forest was amazing, the orchids etc were just beautiful. The Flower Dome was also very good. We walked around in all the gardens and were lucky enough to see a family of otters in Lilypad Lake. Had breakfast in Cafe Crema which was nice if a little limited. Would definitely recommend this to any visitors",,
,,That good we got engaged there.,5,,"This is one of the must see features in Singapore, it was ten years since I last visited Singapore and there was a completely new feature, and with all things Singapore, it was beautifully designed, impeccably clean, full of great features, excellent facilities and of course beautiful gardens.
We visited day and night, and at both times the place was equally stunning. However it was the nighttime where I believe it comes alive with energy. The cloud forest and botanical gardens and sympathetically lit to highlight the wonder features an plants inside. The Cloud forest in particular is spectacular with its waterfall and skywalks.
Satay by the Bay is an excellent Hawker stall conveniently situated at the end of the gardens provides excellent street food at reasonable prices, and is the cheaper of the eateries.
The Supertrees are wonderful to see, and beautifully lit, with a free music show around 8:00 and 9:00 pm on the weekend evenings, which is worth a visit.
All in all, this is a fantastic and must visit attraction.",,
,,Amazing place to see,5,,"If your in the city, it鈥檚 a must-do visit. Stunning design & thoughtful touches ensure a great experience, well worth the short walk in the humid air to get to the Forrest & flower domes.",,
,,cloud forest,5,,"wow! a real paradise on earth , how an artificial man made forest can be created , mind blowing to see, nice flowers , flora and fauna , superb tallest man made waterfall , really amazing , recommend to atleast spare 6-8 hrs to see the whole garden by the bays, can also take OFO cycle , must download the OFO app nd can leave cycle anywhere in singapore",,
,,Gardeners heaven,5,,"We had limited time in Singapore however found most of it spent here, great for all ages. So much to see and do. the colours, variety and themes something for everyone.",,
,,Great experience,5,,Biomes were excellent and well worth the entrance fee. The rest of the gardens were great and free. The sound and light show in the Supertree Grove was worth making a special visit for. Dining experience not bad and reasonably priced.,,
,,Amazing,5,,Definitely worth going to see 馃憣 more countries need to take not of this it was so beautiful 馃槏 we were amazed by the beauty of gardens by the bay,,
,,Beautiful,5,,All of Singapore was beautiful but the Bay Gardens were enormous. The only disappointing part was the amount of tourists that didn't think about who they were backing into when they wanted to take photographs or their ignorance of leaving a pushchair in the middle of the walkway. We went at off peak time but there were still hundreds of people there.,,
,,One of the best example of Green technology and Sustainability,5,,The flower dome and Cloud forest both are worth a visit when there. The entire garden can be visited both during day and night time as both the times have their own charm. The light and sound show at the super grove trees are worth a visit. I visited this place twice during my stay. Its beautiful and worth a flatter. Easily accessible place by MRT.,,
,,Breathtaking and Futuristic,5,,"This is the science fiction future we saw as children in the 1980's. An Oasis of calm in an urban setting. While both sections are attractive, I'd have to consider the aerial waterfall as the highlight of the attraction, particularly with the sense of a change in climate. You go from the humidity of outdoors Singapore to a European Springtime day.

It is'nt cheap, thats the only thing I'll say against it, but then, it is Singapore, its never had a cheap reputation, and what it does right it gets right.",,
,,Flower Dome/Cloud Forest,5,,Visited both attractions on April with my mom. She was astounded with the sheer variety of flower and plants in the display. The dome was very cold so you may need to bring jacket.,,
,,Beautiful,5,,"Such a nice garden with lots of flora and fauna, and water bodies. To me this is one of the best attractions in Singapore. My mind found peace and serenity here.",,
,,"Sustainability, Nature and Technology",5,,"Gardens by the Bay is a perfect day out with family and friends. For children and adults an immersion into the main topics that concern the human being nowadays: global warming, nature, energy among others.
I recommend the visit in the afternoon so you can finish the day watching the lights show in the evening.",,
,,Simply amazing!,5,,Gardens By The Bay was spectacular! Truly unmissable and definitely a must-see if you鈥檙e visiting Singapore.,,
,,Great if you love botany,5,,"This is like the younger, newer cousin to our Botanic Gardens - you'll find all sorts of exotic plants here and learn loads as well, plus there are air-conditioned areas that you can enter when the heat becomes a little too much for you.
The Flower Dome frequently has themed events, such as the sakura festival between the March-April period, and it's really worth having a look inside.
The Cloud Forest remains my favourite, though - as you walk in you'll be greeted by a thundering waterfall (man-made, if you need specifics), and as you make your way upwards through this ""forest"" you'll encounter all sorts of rainforest plants.",,
,,Visiting of DOME,5,,"Cool tempreature and nice enviroment. Nice sakura flowers display, abit crowded. Good to have few more benches around.",,
,,A must to visit,5,,Well worth a visit here. It was a stinking hot day but so pleased we went. There is a shuttle service that takes you around the gardens with a tour. We did not do this but in hindsight we should of...it鈥檚 a lot of walking on a hot day. I am not into gardens at the best of times but this one is not to be missed if you are visiting Singapore.,,
,,Spring Sakura,5,,"overall experience is good with many range of flower breed , nice environment Will expect more different theme in future",,
,,Tulips exibition,5,,surprise me that day ... Having maroon black tulips on this year. having the colorful explore day. REMEMBER THE SLEEPING LADY BLING BLING EYES!!!,,
,,Incredible Views!,4,,"Recently visited Gardens by the Bay and was blown away by the gardens, especially Cloud Forest! The different selected plantings & displays were very impressive & I would highly recommend purchasing the ticket for the cloud forest & the super tree sky walk. Unfortunately the flower garden was closed during my visit. The light/sound show of the super trees at night was also very enjoyable. Great spot for anyone visiting Singapore, particularly families & couples.",,
,,Sakura Matsuri,4,,Enjoyed the display of the sakura and activities held in conjunction w the display at gardens by the bay.,,
,,Unbelievable,5,,"The two domes are very worthwhile a visit, especially for those of us intent on saving our planet. The Cloud Dome goes up 7 stories to display the different climatic zones.",,
,,Not to be missed,5,,"Fantastic area with two Biomes housing Rainforsest and Mediteranian plants. There was a special Cherry Blossom exhibition in April when we were there. The walkway through the Super Trees is a must, as is a visit to the sky deck of the Marina Bay Sands hotel nearby.",,
,,Comes alive with colours at night,5,,"If you鈥檙e ever in the area at night, drop by to visit the stunning garden brightly lit at night. It鈥檚 completely free and you get to enjoy the cool breeze while you take in their light shows every hour or so.

Of course, the trip won鈥檛 be completed without a visit to the flower dome or cloud forest but this is the best place to be at night!",,
,,Great place for flower lovers and family,5,,"It's worthy spending a day in this garden especially for flower lovers and family travellers.
There are so many different species of flowers and plants that you may have never seen or even heard of. The orchid is really beautiful and gorgeous. The souvenir shop offers tons of good gifts for bringing home for friends and family. A must for visitors to Singapore !",,
,,Light show.,5,,"We saw a light show that was based on all classic movies. Really chilled out, everyone lies on the floor and theres loads of space. Definitely have to see in the day and during the night.",,
,,Magnificent,5,,Absolute must. Stunning lazer and music display at night. Eat at one of the many cheap restaurants attached to the side,,
,,Really Stunning,5,,I had heard this was a lovely place to visit and was not disappointed it had so much to see and do. Amazed it is free to see most of the things. You can pay a small amount for a tour which we did as it鈥檚 a big place and it was very hot.,,
,,Excellent,5,,Well worth visit. A dusk visit when the sun falls and the lights go on is a must. Worth paying S$23 to go up the sky deck to watch the lights go on in the garden and all over Singapore,,
,,total experience,5,,I never thought that i would see and experience a wonderful place like this. Be sure to visit the flower dome and the cloud forest as well. Beautiful flowers await you inside the dome. Grab every opportunity to take a selfie with the amazing view. The cloud dome would give you a sure thrill to your spine. Bring out your sweaters and you're ready to chill.,,
,,Light show and garden domes,5,,An outstanding light show at the Gardens and the garden domes are simply magnificent - so worth a visit,,
,,Beauty Within,5,,"Be ready for a mind blowing beautiful, colourful, unique, state of the arts , gorgeous and melodious flowers of the world.

I was amazed by the magical creatures, one that I have never seen in my life.

You must visit to experience it. You will never be dissappointed.",,
,,nice place,5,,Enjoy the visit. Full masti with some friends from Singapore. Will visit again. Best time of my life enjoy full.,,
,,Lovely wander under lights,4,,Beautiful stroll around the gardens and associated light show. Recommend heading just before sunset to see the best of both sides of the gardens,,
,,Loved it!,5,,"On previous visits to Singapore we had been to the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest and thought they were absolutely incredible. This time, however, we wanted to go to the Gardens by the Bay to see the ""Supertrees"" light show in the evening. Wow! It was just so beautiful and was done so well with the music. Something everyone should go and see!!",,
,,Must See,5,,A must see attraction day and night for any stay in Singapore. The free light show in the evening is spectacular.,,
,,Our time in Singapore,5,,Our guide was from buffalo tours .we used them for all our tours in Singapore. Lovely dinner and guided tour of the gardens ..we toured at our own pace and were able to enjoy all the areas of interest,,
,,Unique experience,5,,"This is a glorious place and free! We spent all afternoon here including the domes (which you pay for) and still didn't get round it all. Don't miss the supertrees and the monster huge goldfish pond at the very edge of the park. It does get very hot so a hat and water are a must. I would also recommend a small towel as you will be soaked with sweat! Still, totally worth it. Not like any park I have ever seen and certainly an experience I will never forget.
If on a cruise you can walk from the closest port. I think it's called the Bay Terminal. It takes about 20-30 minutes. There are loads of free, clean toilets all around the park too.",,
,,Cycling with 4-7year old kids,4,,"Gardens by the bay has a path for cyclist and skate smoothers. You get to cycle all the way to MBS too, or towards ford road to the indoor stadium. It was an awesomely fun outing with wonderful scenery. Goodbye to cycling in Bishan Park or east coast park!",,
,,Stunning Attraction,4,,"Loads to see in this great attraction, we visited the flower dome, cloud forest and took the audio tour. Loads to do and see and the audio tour is a great way to get your bearings (would be even better, if it was hop on, hop off). Don't miss an opportunity to visit the suspect trees, which are fabulous.",,
,,Wow!,5,,This place was in my must do list whilst holidaying in Singapore with my family. It was fantastic! Definitely worth staying for the light show at night!,,
,,Loved the ambiance,5,,The whole set up is very ascetically pleasing to the eye. Easily spent 4 hours here. We went up to the restaurant where the views were pretty good and the aircon was cool.,,
,,Christmas special,4,,"We toured the gardens on a Sunday afternoon into the evening just before Christmas with special tickets for the celebrations. Very hot and alot to see, even some snow fell for the children.",,
,,A lot of seeing,5,,This is a very nice place to see. You鈥檒l see all the flowers and trees from different paras of the globe. Big trees must be seen and better in the evening when it鈥檚 dark. What a wonderful light- and musicshow.,,
,,Super,5,,It's a must. Don't miss the show in the evening. All that area is amazing and you should find time to visit ir,,
,,Holidays,4,,More spectacular by night where all the lights are on. There is a food court and restaurants. Marina bay is at a walking distance.,,
,,Beautiful,4,,We visited for my 40th birthday and was very disappointed I didn鈥檛 realise the flower dome was closed for maintenance as I didn鈥檛 see anything in the web page. The cloud dome was absolutely breathtaking though and made for an enjoyable few hours viewing,,
,,Garden of the Bay,5,,"I took some Russian visitors to garden of the bay as it was too hot for them in Singapore. There are 2 air- conditioned domes which house beautiful flowers ( based on seasons) and plants.

The view is fantastic as well. U get to see marina bay sand hotel. It is a nice walk around garden of the bay in the evening.",,
,,$3 SHUTTLE SERVICE very Rude and unpleasant staffs,1,,"I suggest you to never pay for $3 SHUTTLE SERVICE

Me and my family went there on 3rd of April 2018. As my dad is an eldery and had some leg pain I purchased 4 tickets of $3 SHUTTLE SERVICE for whole day service. However, I am very unhappy with their rude staffs.

Besides the staff treating us so badly.
at 8:58 pm when the last light show at super trees finishes. I ran to get the buggy for my dad to take. However the supervisor said we cant wait for your dad even though he is old and his leg pain. Ask us to walk back!!

The buggy left at 8:59 pm as the supervisor instruct the driver to dont wait even though he could see my dad walking towards us with difficulty.

I am so disappointed and hurt.

For those who think they managing this please keep in mind that they need to schedule their buggy during the times that people NEED IT.
last buggy at 9 pm doesnt make sense when your stupid super tree show ends at 8:58 pm.

Please understand for people who force to take this horrible service it is because they have health issue or they are old in age.

Such a stupid management and ground staff.",,
,,Fantastic gardens.,5,,"This ""glasshouse"" is an eye opener! From the moment you walk in there are so many individual areas of interest with agrdens with different themes, not omnly plantings but statues etc. We were lucking as there was a large exhibition of Japanese themed garden. Don't expect to spend less than 2 hours here.",,
,,Amazing place not to be missed,5,,Not enough space to write all the good things about this place. If you only have a day in Singapore make sure this is on your not negotiable list.,,
,,Captivating View of Nature,5,,"Visiting the place was memorable, thou there was a long queue you won't be bored since there was a lot of picture perfect view of Flora. The architecture is amazing, with such a small area they were able to put a lot. Don't forget to visit the place when you go to Singapore.",,
,,Gardens by the bay,5,,"WOW - this was way better than I expected. Went to these gardens over 2 days, early one morning for the observatories and at night time for the light show. Spectacular and captivating, we all loved this masterpiece (the light show). The observatories were wonderful as well and the thought process that Singapore shows in recycling is amazing. You can鈥檛 visit Singapore without visiting these gardens, it was one of my favourite places",,
,,Beautifully presented,5,,Brought my friends from Switzerland there. My friends were absolutely delighted and impressed with what there saw. Absolutely worth a visit.,,
,,cloud and flower dome,5,,The cloud dome was fantastic plan to spend at least a couple of hours if you want to take everything in. The flower dome was also amazingly beautiful but so cold that we had to leave before we could really get to see it properly. So a reminder to take something warm if you do not like things too cold and it really was cold. Wandering the gardens was peaceful and are kept so well. If one has time they could spend at least half a day or even all day. They have a nice Dim Sum restaurant just the other side of the Flower Dome. Reasonable for Singapore.,,
,,Out of this World!!!!,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is an amazingly beautiful park. Words cannot fully express how magical this place is, particularly at night when they do the light show. This is truly a must see when in Singapore.",,
,,Beautiful Gardens. Buy combo ticket,5,,"We visited the Cloud and Flower Domes. Both are very beautiful, but very different. The Cloud dome reminds me of Pangea in the movie Avatar. It鈥檚 unique. The Flower Dome has meticulous blooming gardens with sculptures that make unlike other botanical gardens. The combination ticket was only 20 SD by showing Singapore Air airline ticket. Lovely way to spend a day. Enjoyable and relaxing.",,
,,Loved it,5,,We hadn't been to Singapore for about 15 years so this was all a surprise to us. We spent a full day here and were blown away. The only downside for us was that there were so many people - probably our fault for going at a weekend and for Chinese New Year. We especially loved the Cloud Forest.,,
,,Well worth a visit,4,,"Beautiful attraction to visit, especially if the weather isn't great, flower dome was fabulous, wouldnt hesitate to return. You need a good day here to see everything.",,
,,Exceptional place to visit,5,,"This has to be the highlight of our Singapore visit. The gardens and greenhouses are extraordinary. The flowers, plants and trees come from all over the world and are exquisite in colour and design. The show trees outside are a wonder and each corner you turned was another wonder to the eye. The gardens are free but there is a well worth cost for the greenhouses. We wish we鈥檇 had the time to visit this attraction at night as we鈥檇 seen it from afar and it looked amazing. These gardens are the best we鈥檝e ever visited and a must for all those that visit the beautiful city of Singapore.",,
,,Paradise created,5,,"Gardens by the bay is an artificially created garden by Singapore and is marvelous masterpiece showing the excellence the Singaporeans are capable of producing. Singapore is without any doubt setting standards for the world to emulate. The garden is conveniently located and accessible by all meas of transport available. The garden is overlooked by marina bay sands hotel. Visit to garden can be planned with Skypark, Merlion Park and other attractions in the vicinity. The garden consists of artificial supertrees which are lighted in the evening. There are two domes - Flower Dome and Cloud dome. While there is no fee for entering garden however you need to buy tickets for these two domes. While Flower dome has wide variety of flowers from all over the world makinf you feel in an eternal spring the cloud dome creates environs of various altitude and geographic diversity. You should be prep to do a lot of walking and a shuttle service is available at a price from entry to the gardens to the dome and back. It will take around three to four hours if you want to visit both the domes. In the evening a light and sound show is organised in the supertree zone. it is recommended to come around 4 in the evening to fully enjoy the garden, domes and light show to culminate. The Singapore sky is awesome in the evening which can be appreciated while returning from the gardens.",,
,,Simply stunning,5,,"We called in here whilst spending an afternoon in the city, ahead of our evening flight. Such a beautiful oasis in the heart of the city.",,
,,Stunning gardens,5,,"The outdoor gardens are free and cover an extensive area so one can spend as little or as long as you have available. We arrived via the MRT Bayfront station. There are many different sections featuring trees and plants of different types or climates. The section with animals, including a fruit bat and orangutan, sculpted in topiary was a highlight as were the imposing man-made supertrees climbing 25 metres high.
No visit to the gardens is however complete without paying the S$28 entrance to the two vast conservatories. We spent an hour in each with the air conditioning making them a great respite from the relentless heat and humidity outside. The plants and flowers were simply stunning and vast number of photos were taken.
For a further S$8, we ascended the skyway, which runs 25m high between a couple of the supertrees, for high level views of the gardens and the city skyline.
In all, we spent well over 4 hours here and would have been there longer if it wasn't for the intense heat.",,
,,Beautiful,4,,A lovely attraction near marina bay. Reasonably priced . We were lucky and lots of flowers were in their prime. A few hours spent here along with the skywalk. Loved the metal lit up trees.,,
,,Great free attraction,5,,"Wonderful place to take a young family, loads to do. The children's water park was awesome and all free.",,
,,Wow - What a great place to be,5,,We can't imagine such a great place in the US. It is one of the best gardens in the world and most of it is free. We spent two days exploring it. Don't miss the sound and light show at the bay which I think is done two or more times a night. There is also a garden for kids my young kids enjoyed the time there. This place in Singapore is simply the best!,,
,,worth the money,5,,"make sure you watch the light show at 7.45 or 8.45 pm, before that you can spend the time in cloud forest and flower dome. the flower dome is very crowded and feels messy, the cloud forest is way better then the flower dome.",,
,,Simply excellent - worth spend an entire day,5,,"This place is simply excellent - definitely worth the ticket prices for the 2 indoor ones - looking back, if anything, I would allocate myself more time at this place - definitely a lot to see and learn!",,
,,Worth a visit,5,,"Great, if you love greenery, and we do! We didn't spend ages here, maybe just an hour, but that was perfect.",,
,,"Tranquil, relaxed, worth the visit",4,,"We enjoyed wandering around the gardens without visiting the indoor paid sections. It can be hot and tiring but there are plenty of places to rest in the shade and take in a leafy view. Very well maintained, as you would expect in Singapore, and popular, it is a must see attraction.
We watched the evening light show which is also worth seeing. The lit-up giant trees, combined with music offer a different dimension of attraction.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"The gardens by the bay was a lovely place to go to. It has 2 big domes or greenhouses that each contain their own wonders: one of them contained ""the cloud forest"" which is a huge structure covered in a vast array of vegetation and flowers, it also houses the world's largest indoor waterfall. The other dome is the ""flower dome"" which was full of a huge range of flowers from all over the world, however it was extremely busy and was quite difficult to enjoy all of it while trying to manoeuvre your way around many people, but that shows how popular it is.
You also have the Supertree grove which is a number of huge structures meant to look like trees, they're very pretty and at night they do a light show with the trees which is amazing.",,
,,Come Ready to Walk...in a crowd,5,,"By all means come to this amazing space and just enjoy the wonder of it all. Wear your very most comfortable walking shoes, pack some snacks (or eat at one of the cafes) and just explore it. It's a glorious space. It gets VERY crowded so try to arrive very early or go in the evening when it's less hectic.",,
,,Night Lights were fantastic,5,,Recommend viewing Gardens by the Bay both in the daytime and at night to view the symphony lights it is well worth seeing,,
,,Garden,5,,Awww.. awsome place ever seen by my eyes. Nature conserved and protected nd decorated very nicely. Natures love and beauty is seen at one place and under one roof,,
,,Must do !,5,,"Nice short light shows several times every night (free access), allocate 15minutes to walk from the MRT to the show location. Could forest is a bit pricey yet 100% worth the visit!",,
,,Tiring but fun,5,,"We've had to walk for the whole day which was tiring, but it was also a fun experience because we got to see a lot of different types of plants, flowers, and trees.",,
,,Just amazing - there are no words!,5,,"Mouths open wide in awe the whole time, AMAZING! The cloud forest topped it for us, incredible. Kids took heaps of photos too. Pollen cafe not great though - food was way over priced!",,
,,Beautiful by day and night,5,,We visited during the day and at night. Watching the light show at the supergrove was just beautiful (shows at 7:45pm and 8:45pm). Easiest way to get there is catch the MRT to Bayfront station underneath Marina bay and walked to gardens from there,,
,,Outstanding,5,,"A must do on your visit to Singapore. We spent 7 hours here and it was incredible.

We did the buggy tour which was $8 adults and $3 child and took around 20 minutes. Well worth it and saved our legs as it takes you around it all with commentary.

Admittedly our 9 year old did play in the Children鈥檚 garden as they have an adventure course and a water play area to cool off. Cafe there served fried food so we avoided it. We did eat at the restaurant in the Flower dome (forgetting name sorry) and it was very good a lot of the tables were booked so we had coffee and cake at the bar. Wonderful freshly squeezed juices so do try one.

We started off in the flower dome and the tulip display is spectacular. There is some wonderful theatre for children with sleeping giants amongst the tulips whose eyes open and shut! Magical.

Next was the other dome with the most amazing waterfall. Again spectacular and the flora stunning.

Both domes are air conditioned so a wonderful respite from the heat. This place is incredible and well worth the visit.",,
,,Superb!,5,,A must place to go when in Singapore. Go there in the evening when all the Supergrove trees are lighted up.,,
,,Great but busy,4,,Great place but mega big queues for h cloud forest experience and so make sure you book well in advance The huge trees are amazing and free to see but so worth it,,
,,A Must Do when in Singapore,4,,"Go in the afternoon and stay until the evening to watch the FREE light and music show, if its too hot pop into the Cloud Forest Dome to cool off, worth every Dollar.",,
,,Worth to visit,4,,Beautiful place and snap night view photos here.LED light performance start at 7.45pm and 8.45pm. Enjoy nice performance here,,
,,The sound and light show at 7.45pm and 8.45pm is not to be missed,5,,We spent time in the free to enter areas. The kids enjoyed the children's water play area. The shops had plenty of goodies. The dining area the satay at the bay offered choice and good value. There were western meals and Asian choices. However we were there really to see the sound and light show. Dancing lights to well known music. A real,,
,,Beautiful natural exhibits,5,,"Amazing collection of flowering plants, cacti, and other kinds of foliage. The cloud forest exhibit had tons of information about impacts of manmade effects on the environment and climate change impacts on the world overall. Very impressive.",,
,,High tech view of nature,4,,"The Gardens by the Bay are very attractive, well designed and maintained. You can spend quite a bit of time there, as there is the Cloud Forest, Flower Dome, and SuperTree Grove, which lights up at night. It is not cheap: $28 plus extra for the sky walk, but it is a good family activity.",,
,,A city of gardens,5,,"The gardens are well worth a visit - they are beautiful and exotic - even though the whole city seems to be a garden, this is special! We had a wonderful time.",,
,,Must visit,5,,You should definitely visit this place if you are in Singapore. It is truly a magical experience especially in the evening when the super groves are lit up. Try to visit this place around 7.30 pm as there is a spectacular light and music show at that time (please recheck the timings with locals). Lying down on the ground witnessing the dance of lights was very humbling for me. :),,
,,Excellent,5,,"This was truly a remarkable place by both day and night. Do both if you can, but if you can鈥檛 definitely do the night and watch and listen to the light show. Unforgettable!! This was a major highlight of our trip",,
,,What a Great Place...,5,,We visited the Gardens by the Bay on two occasions during our stay because we enjoyed the atmosphere and the different exhibits so much. The Cloud Forest was spectacular and the Flower Dome so cool it felt like perpetual spring. Do not miss the SuperTree light show!,,
,,"Great attraction, not fisted anything like this before",5,,"Great day wondering the park. Audio tram tour is a good way to see the park, learn about the different areas and not break out in a sweat. Conservatories are a must to visit but the actual park is free to expire and you will visit more than once.",,
,,Walk through Gardens by the Bay,5,,"It's terrific! All the plants, flowers, the constructions just breathtaking. It's really worth to spend a few hours there.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"The gardens are stunning. We especially loved the cloud forest dome, unbelievable selection of flowers and plants. Considering the size of the dome there is a huge amount crammed in. Well with a visit",,
,,Wonderful place to visit,5,,"We spent nearly 4 hours here, wandering through the outdoor gardens and the two domes. The otters were an absolute draw for us- even more so when they followed us down the road and crossed the road at an otter crossing. We loved the Cloud dome miles more than the flower dome as we have many of those plants in our garden. Be warned- the skywalk was closed for a while which frustrated us.",,
,,Light show,5,,Another great show to see and does not cost ypu anything. Find your spot early can get really busy. Sit back or lay on the ground look up and enjoy this great show. Two shows nightly 7.45 and 8.45.,,
,,Sakura exhibition on March 2018! Beautifull!,5,,"You better check the schedule to know what flower are blooming in flower dome. We are lucky to saw Sakura. Very pretty! Kindly check on their website, and also check their black out date for maintanance.
We bought the ticket on KLO*K
Cheaper than buying at the place, and also easy to use.
We only visit flower dome and cloud forest.
Night and day both beautifull, we cant decide which one is better.
At cloud forest, they have spesific time to make fog, tha ambiance was magical.
Reaching this place was very easy, simply use MRT and stop by Bayfront station then take a walk.
This is one of the best ecperience in Singapore. Please take your time to visit this wonder!",,
,,A Garden for All,5,,"Must see in Singapore, even you are not enthusiasts about gardens and flowers. You will appreciate diffent species of plants and flowers. Just bring caps ang umbrellas if you intend to explore the entire area. Must better to bring extra clothes as the weather is hot.
Highly recommended for tourist.",,
,,Nice,4,,Definitely nice place to check out if your visiting singapore you won't see something like this anywhere else. Took about 2hrs to complete entire tour then headed to marina bay accross.,,
,,"Incredible light show, photos don鈥檛 do it justice",5,,"Went here as an evening out in Singapore, were told to arrive for the sunset to see the light show (at 19:45) and it did not disappoint. Found that I was taking hundreds of photos to try and capture the beauty of the place but they didn鈥檛 do it justice. Highly recommend!!!",,
,,Amazing night,5,,You really have to experience this if you travel to Singapore the gardens especially at night are totally amazing and the light show with its musical backing are a sight to see don鈥檛 miss it !!,,
,,Amazing space in the city,5,,"This place captures the ambition of Singapore鈥檚 Garden City better than any other.

Amazing array of plant life and brilliant green space. Lots of other 鈥榩aid鈥?activities within this space that build on this Eden theme.

You could spend a day easily just walking through these beautiful gardens.",,
,,Lovely view,5,,We had a very lovely time at the Singapore Gardens by the Bay. There are great photo opportunities all around the area.,,
,,From the future,5,,"Go if in Singapore, even a layover! It's something very special. I went into both domes: Flower Dome & Cloud Forest. I did this on a 24 hr layover on a whim. Walk up rate is $28 SGD for both. It's a/c so a nice break from the heat. I loved every plant and flower plus the whimsical arty additions... then go outside to the Supertree Groves. There is a daily evening show (745pm & 945pm at time of visit) that is a must see called Rhapsody where they marry music with a Supertree light show. I did this all in 2 hours but I would take another hour or so to see the grounds. Lots to see!",,
,,Another must do visiting Singapore,5,,"A great place especially the light show at 7:45pm, must do when visiting Singapore. Easy enough to get to with bus/taxi and reasonably priced.",,
,,Very pretty,4,,"Was pretty and a must see in Singapore - light show is good but super busy.
Cloud dome is very nice but we found the flower dome rather boring but we aren鈥檛 exactly into our cactus plants so maybe if you have an interest it would be good.
Very well maintained and the choice of restaurants etc was good.",,
,,Great trip with family !!!,5,,Good weather with cool air make fresh for a weekend day. My family have good time in there. My parent really happy with short visit.,,
,,Very nice place,4,,Relaxing and beautiful place to spend time with your family. The blossoms were absolutey beautiful. A great location to take pictures.,,
,,Very pleasant way to pass a few hours,5,,My wife and I spend a very relaxing morning wandering through the beautiful gardens. There is a lot so see and enjoy.,,
,,True example of design and beauty.,5,,"Where can I start? Right from the moment you enter this place you are astounded at the planning, design and complexity of the layout.
The domes are most likely the most impressive with the flowers, displays and layout. World Award winning exhibitions, this place could easily consume a whole day and even then you might miss something. Don鈥檛 hold back a definite most see.",,
,,Not to be Missed,5,,"This place is amazing, so much to see and do. We have travelled around the world and not visited anywhere like this before.",,
,,Gardens,4,,"Worth seeing. A recreation of natural beauty in beautiful surroundings, great place to escape the hustle and bustle. Complicated to get to.",,
,,Must see,5,,Definitely a must do if visiting Singapore. The cloud forest and flower dome are spectacular there is a charge to enter these but well worth it. You can walk around the the supertree grove free of charge.,,
,,Stunning,5,,"We visited Gardens by the Bay on our recent stop over. The displays are really amazing; representing many different countries. They are so well maintained, it was really lovely to wander around and be in awe of the wonderful displays. We easily spent 2 hours wandering through.

When we left we headed towards the light show which started at 7.45pm, firstly grabbing some dinner at the many cuisines that were on offer, we chose the thai which we all enjoyed.

The light show was stunning; an amazing show of lights and music on the flower like structures was just spectacular. I believe the show was repeated at 8.45pm

Well worth a visit",,
,,Wonderful Gardens,4,,Truly beautiful gardens to walk though and a very helpful staff. They can be a bit crowded so don't expect a lot of peaceful time but it's still worth the time to see.,,
,,you can't miss this place.,5,,"It is awsome. Acres of plants, shrubs garden environments and man made ""trees"" in the air with walkways above the gardens. And at night there is a light show and it's all lit up. Plan to spend several hours there. You won't be sorry. It was built a year or 2 ago so if you were in Singapore in the past , it wasn't there.",,
,,Great show,5,,"We went to the gardens before sunset and it was quite an amazing place, not being normally a garden lover of sorts I was a little skeptical and figured HoHum but it鈥檚 quite interesting. Then following dinner we were treated to an amazing light show which was well worth being there for. Many people gather on the grass areas for the show and it鈥檚 worth the wait and trip.",,
,,Amazing visit!,5,,Definitely recommend to anyone in the Singapore area. A must visit! Its beautiful and a great retreat from the heat and humidity!,,
,,Superb Aerial View,4,,The aerial view you experience is very unique and you feel the closeness to your partner in a romantic setup as well. The broader view of the Singapore skyscraper is well experienced.,,
,,Quick trip,4,,Only popped in to look at the trees whilst out and about on our hired scooters. The gardens are very well maintained and a must visit,,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,"We visited Gardens by the Bay without a tour. Signage is very good and we paid $14/adult to enter the Flower Dome during the morning. This was a welcome relief from the humidity outside given its air conditioning. They have displays for different countries.
We took advantage of the re-entry by getting a stamp on your hand on the way out of the flower dome. We went back at 7pm to see the same displays that are lit up at night. Dome closes at 8.30pm.
We then left there to see the light show to music in the Gardens by the Bay centered on the various towers that started at 7.45pm. This was worthwhile with lights and music. They have the same show repeated at 8.45pm.
We then headed over to the back of the Marina Bay Sands hotel for their lights, water and music show that started at 9pm. This was also worthwhile. This is a repeat of their 8pm show.
Doing these activities in this order allowed us to cover all of these in one night.",,
,,Very unique place to visit,4,,"Was an amazing visit to Singapore. Enjoyed the gardens, the marina, light shows, and the Marina hotel. Must see at night.",,
,,The attraction you MUST visit in Singapore,5,,"The attraction is quite stunning, both visually and in terms of engineering. I visited with family just before Christmas and the light show, which takes place every evening, saw the the flower-like structures light up in sequence to music and was simply spectacular. The two huge domes contain an amazing collection of flower and fauna with the sky walk in the rain forest dome a must do. All-in-all, a credit to what man can create and a relatively inexpensive but outstanding attraction. We took a taxi from our central hotel but later found out (when walking back) that it's a pleasant walk from the Marina area.",,
,,Spectacular view,4,,Fantastic place to visit with family. We enjoyed it very much. The flower domes were marvellous. Worth every dollar spent. The staffs are efficient and helpful.,,
,,"I am not a fan of gardens and flowers, still enjoyed the place",4,,Initially i was not too keen on visiting a garden and see flowers. But once there i thoroughly enjoyed it. Especially the cloud forest was awesome. Must visit on a singapore trip,,
,,Awesome Place,5,,"Hello,

I was really amazed with this place, it is very unique, original, environment friendly and beautiful. The way it is designed is really good.

I spent few hours so I could not visit the entire place. Fortunately I could see the light show at night time.

Two main recommendations:
- Do not hesitate to go
- Plan at least 6 hours at this place

Regards",,
,,Beautiful,5,,Was an amazing visit. Laid out so easy to get around. Beautiful specimens. Amazing light show. Lots of easy places to stop and rest.,,
,,Cloud dome is a must see,4,,Our first visit was to Cloud Dome which was awesome so our visit to Flower dome the next day was a little disappointing because it was being set up for a tulip extravaganza two days later so the flowers were not blooming. Some of the gardens looked in need of pruning and tidying up.,,
,,Cool inside and orchids amazing,5,,Recommended by a fellow traveler and thoroughly enjoyed the attraction. Day was hot and humid but inside the domes the climate was very cool. Well worth a visit,,
,,It Takes about 3 hours to go around,5,,Beautiful waterfalls All kind of plantations Great design The queue for the tickets was long but we managed,,
,,A must see when visiting Singapore,5,,"In my opinion this is a must see when visiting Singapore. The flower dome and cloud forest are amazing, don't be in a rush just take your time to enjoy it. It does take longer then you expect so allow plenty of time.

The light show in the evening is fantastic and only goes for around 10-15 minutes, it is on twice a night but allow 20 minutes to grab a seat. It's free to enjoy so you don't need to pay to visit the flower dome or cloud forest if you just want to enjoy the show.

I would recommend pre buying tickets which we did at our hotel as the line up at the ticket gate was long when we were there. We were able to basically walk strait into the cloud dome with no wait.",,
,,Great Show,5,,The light show is great. Be prepared for long waits at the taxi rank if you require a taxi but it does move quite quickly,,
,,Fantastic night experience,5,,Public access to the garden is free and open up to 2am. Perfectly safe and pleasant walk with spectacular views. Even moody teenager appreciates experience :),,
,,"Top day, best to go on a Weekday",5,,"We teamed this up with a visit to the Skydeck at Marina Bay Sands and filled the whole day. There were no overcrowding problems for our Wednesday visit.

If you to purchase through this website, your actual 鈥渢icket鈥?will be emailed as a scannable PDF up to 24 hrs later, otherwise buy at the counter. This is near the minibus station next to the flyover bridge (originating from the hotel plaza) that will drive you to the domes if you don鈥檛 feel like a 20 minute walk.",,
,,Amazing,5,,"The only downside is that this was crowded. But I suppose all of Asia is. That said, it鈥檚 truly worth it to go here.",,
,,Well done Singapore!!!,5,,"Amazing gardens, beautifully laid out, great dining, fantastic light and sound show - awe inspiring overall. And FREE!!! except for the domes.",,
,,worth the visit,5,,the light show was a bit touristy but a walk around the grounds is recommended. It's amazing to see how the take renewable and green energy to new levels.,,
,,Lovely refuge from the heat,5,,Really enjoyed a visit to the Gardens by the Bay. Really impressed by what has been created. If you buy tickets online you avoid the queues and it's a few dollars cheaper. Highly recommend.,,
,,Amazing!!,5,,"Loved loved loved the cloud forest dome! Possibly the best backdrop view anyone could ask. The flowers and plants to admire were countless, and ever so relaxing and calming.",,
,,Fabulous place to visit,5,,What an amazing place to visit. Plenty to see and do. Lots of areas to walk around. High suspended walkway was quiet on the day we visited which was fab though I can imagine it getting very busy at times. The domes were spectacular especially the Cloud Forest. The indoor waterfall and plant life were amazing. The light and sound show in the evening was fab.,,
,,Supertrees!,4,,A great place to walk around day and night. The supertrees are fascinating and the light show a treat to watch.,,
,,Known for its beautiful design and view!,5,,This is a must visit place in Singapore simply known for its luxurious design and view. One cannot miss the chance to take good pictures.here.,,
,,Simply amazing!,5,,"A great attraction, really unique and stunning views. A bit pricey but worth it! Deffo do the sky walk.",,
,,Unreal,5,,Unreal and breath taking ever view you take amaze you. Make sure you watch the light show in the evening. Without doubt my highlight of the trip.,,
,,It's too crowded,3,,"It's great grandeur. Any way because of too crowded on Saturday afternoon, It's make me rather upset.",,
,,My visit at the Gardens by the Bay,4,,"This was one of the Night Tour I joined during my visit in Singapore lately. The Night Tour included: Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay Sands SkyPark, and River Cruise.
Except for a few occasional showers, otherwise the performance of the light show could have been perfected. The light show started at 745 pm sharp in the evening. The fantasies of the lighting effects along with the beautiful music made it a very successful performance. The flashes kept blinking & the videos taping were on.
The show was so smooth & luckily it was not rainning at all so I did enjoy the light show so much. I perhaps may try to visit it during the day time if visiting S'pore another time. I would like to rate it as 9.5 if 10 is the perfect score !",,
,,An Amazing 'Garden' wonderland,5,,"What an exciting experience to visit this modern marvel in Singapore. Absolutely loved spending an entire afternoon here, lots to do, lots to see, simply amazing!",,
,,A Must in Singapore!,5,,"If your going to Singapore and not visit this place then you鈥檒l regret your time in Singapore, it鈥檚 a really must do if your here and it鈥檚 so beautiful!

First tip is to visit the Marina Mall and when your in the Mall take the escalator to the top and from there you鈥檒l have a gorgeous view over the light show over the garden starts 20:00

Walk down the stair and you鈥檙e on the entrance,
I would say to walk the park start from east side and walk around to north then vest and finish of at the Same place you cane from.

Their is a lot of things to do so make sure you make this to a half/full day and don鈥檛 forget to see this light show.

Let me know if you want me to visit something else in Singapore.

,,Simply stunning,5,,"There is so much to see in this attraction , a definite must do when visiting Singapore. We were amazed with the Beauty of the two domes and really enjoyed our visit.",,
,,Very beautiful - just go and see yourself :),4,,"Located just across the famous ""Marina Bay Sands"" Hotel. Take your time for the gardens area with all its attractions - we spent half a day there.

The main and the most famous attractions are the ""Supertrees"" with its Skyway, the ""Flower Dome"" and the ""Cloud Forest"". There will be people anywhere and anytime, because it's famous and that's life :)

Both doms are great and nicely done, my mom would spend days in there! Enjoy your time and don't just rush through. A tip, during the last 2 hours you will find fewer people there. Because...

...most of them are standing just below the Supertrees :)
Those trees are awesome as well as the Skyway above. Although open until 9PM, have 2 things in mind: Last admission and ticket sale are at 8PM and the waiting line is sometimes one hour.

The Garden Rhapsody, the music and light show of the Supertrees is marvelous. I just wish there would more than 2 shows only (745PM / 845PM). And a show every half an hour would be great as well. Because if you just missed one show you have to wait another hour.

I also like the idea that only the attractions aren't for free but the whole park is. You can go and enjoy walking or even running there. Gardens by the bay is a must!",,
,,"This is a must to visit, fantastic day trip!",5,,"We were delighted we went to the Gardens by the Bay, as a family it was a great day out and our 3 year old loved it. I would definitely recommend going. We went late afternoon and stayed for the sun going down with the light show.",,
,,Good Trip but there were a few inconvenience caused,4,,"Overall, me and my 3yr old child enjoyed the trip... Beautiful place.

However, the nursing room was not a condusive setup at all. It was filthy and warm. The door does not indicate if it is occupied or not, hence lots of knocking on the door.

There was no prayer area for muslims. Checked with the staff and was informed that it has been removed.",,
,,Saw it from Marina Bay,4,,"They have a light show in the evening a few times so you have to see it, from there you have go to the Marina Bay Sands light show too.",,
,,Garden By the Bay - Flora Doom,5,,Must go experience this magnificent garden made to sooth the hot climate of Singapore. This is a place for flower loving visitors and a welcome relief away from the humidity and heat. Also a place to learn how green energy is been used to cool the place....,,
,,Beautiful flower dome,5,,Beautiful gardens to visit on the bay. Try to go in the evening when you can see it before dark but also after dark so you can see the lights. You can also walk along the water to the very high end mall next door.,,
,,Very nice,5,,Excellent Park with loads to do. We hired a shuttle to the domes as its a long walk. The kids garden is great for the kids. Worth the visit.,,
,,An interesting time,5,,Went to Gardens of the Bay twice. First to visit the Domes both which were fascinating. Depressing film on pollution and climate change but I guess we need to know about this. Also went for dinner at the Supertree restaurant which was very good and also watched the free light show which was a bit Disneyesque but still worth it,,
,,Amazing,5,,"Definitely worth a few hours to stroll through the pavilions as well as the grounds. The 2 pavilions are not inexpensive, but worth the price. Save yourself some time by either purchasing online or at your hotel before you come over. Reasonable (though warm) walk from hotels in the Raffles area. The 2 inside pavilions are amazing and air conditioned!",,
,,Amazing,5,,What a beautiful well thought out attraction. Entry to the gardens is free and then a ticket is required for sky way and conservatories. Absolutely stunning and a quick walk to and from marina bay.,,
,,Amazing,5,,"A credit to Singapore, these gardens are on reclaimed land, and there are so many different parts to see. The Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest biomes are worth every penny ( reviewed separately) of their entry fee, but the rest of the park is beautifully set out and well-tended; you can walk for ages. There are different cafes in the gardens, and all served very good food and drinks. We could have stayed longer than the 1 day.",,
,,Flower Dome & Cloud Forest + Sakura japan fair,5,,"It is always a pleasant experience at gardens by the bay. This time round was to visit the flower dome to see the sakura display. Since my family and I were there, we visited the cloud forest and sakura japan fair too. Was really impressed by the beautiful flowers and display. Though this was not my first time visiting gardens by the bay, I am always blown away by the upkeep of the whole building. Well done, staff of Gardens by the bay!

The sakura japan fair was a chance upon, as we didn't know there was one such interesting exhibition. The origami session was fun and the kimono clad Japanese ladies who taught us crane origami were so polite and gracious; even the gentleman who greeted us at the origami queue was helpful and courteous. It is really a fantastic event. May i suggest Gardens by the bay hold more of such different nationalities fair/event; to introduce and encourage more visitors/locals to get to know different cultures, food, hobbies etc. from other countries.",,
,,Beautiful gardens,4,,"We visited the gardens during the daytime first and we were happy enough walking around the main gardens without paying to visit the extra areas, although comments do seem to suggest they are worth the entry fee.
The easiest way to get here is through the shopping mall/hotel over the road.
The limited dining within the gardens is ok but a little expensive.
We returned the following night when the gardens were lit and beautiful to look at and photograph.
This is a good place to spend a few hours particularly as the main gardens are free to walk around.",,
,,a bit overcrowded,4,,"go there in the evening because it鈥檚 less hot. however we鈥檙e told the waiting time to go up the skywalk was an hour and forty minutes, so we ended going up to the tree bar in anticipation of better views of the light show. how wrong were we, the views up there were good enough, but we needed to get down to the ground level in order to see the light show properly. don鈥檛 bother about the tree top bar because all of the waiters were indifferent and couldn鈥檛 care less. the taxi line after the show might take about half an hour to wait.",,
,,Worth a visit,4,,"Visited the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome, two biomes used to highlight some lovely flora. We didn't have enough time to extend our visit more widely. Had a G&T at the top of one oif the Supertrees, then came back to the ground to watch the light show.",,
,,Great place!,5,,"Excellent place! Very interesting, and very beautiful. Great place to visit and spend the whole afternoon. Really nice for family or by yourself. Very clean and well kept.",,
,,A Magical Evening,5,,This place is quite nice during the day but in the evening it turns magical. The lights are just incredible to watch. Perfect time to go is just before sunset.,,
,,Must go.....,5,,"Fabulous garden. Unfortunately when we went the OCBC skyway was closed for maintenance, but the rest of the gardens were beautiful. We paid to go into both domes and were not disappointed. We also paid approx 拢4pp for a narrated tour around the gardens by cart, again worth the small cost.",,
,,Unique and worth the time,5,,"Great visit. A unique collection of flowers, trees, and more. The dome with the waterfall is really spectacular. So much thought went into this facility. Recommendation: visit during a hot day as both domes are have air-conditioning (aircon)!",,
,,Sakura experience,5,,"Was there on the last day of exhibit. Much of the cherry blossom withered, unforturnately. But blooming ones are still beautiful. Advice is to go during the beginning of the season.",,
,,Amazing environment day or night,5,,We spent 3.5 hours wandering through the gardens and visiting the Cloud Forest & Flower Dome incredible flora and waterfall. Then continued into the night to see the lights of the Super Tree Grove such wonderful atmosphere of lights and good food. It was very hot when we went so take/drink plenty of water.,,
,,Sakura season in Gardens by the Bay,5,,My family got a chance to appreciate the beauty of Sakura flowers. We enjoyed the Japanese food sold at the fair.,,
,,A most see,4,,Something that needs to be seen. You can do a whole day out here. Don't miss the light show in the evening.,,
,,Very good atmosphere in the flower dome,5,,"It was fully airconditioned which helps to beat the crazy heat outside. The flowers were beautiful.
Only wish that it had more info on the flowers as my mom seem to ask about them at every pit stop.
But all in all, loved the 45mins walk inside the flower dome and had short breaks as there were seats around. Would go again if there were any other events such as the sakura one.",,
,,Awesome Themed Gardens,5,,Went during April where they had the Sakura Flowers up for display which was absolutely stunning and beautify. There were also many other varieties of different floral arrangements and useful information placards to know more about the species and name of the particular plant which was extremely interesting to read about. Will DEFINEITLY visit again,,
,,Magical,5,,"I was honestly not expecting to be blown away by these but a week later I can definitely recall it as an unforgettable experience.
We went there on a weekend so there were long queues and many people. I would recommend visiting early in the day on a working day to get the maximum out of your visit.
The cloud forest was our favorite. Considerable effort has been made to create the rainforest affect and the sight and smells of the place transport you to South America.
Fauna and flora are tagged, so easy to identify if you are interested but even if you are not an avid botanist, the overall mood and the sound of the falling water relaxes you.
We did not spend too much time in the flower garden and could not make it to the walkway between the super trees.
You will need at least 4-5 if you want to really enjoy the gardens. Add another hour if you have children and want to take them to the children's garden.",,
,,Indoor nature,4,,The 2nd time here!! After 5 years. There was a japan exibition going on and place is too crowded but all is good!,,
,,Sakura mifune,4,,The sakura blossom was very beautiful. Suggest going in late afternoon to night when you will be able to see both day and night scenery of the place.,,
,,The best zoo!,4,,When I got there to the zoo I already saw amazing animals! It was a bit crowded but I was I was fine. I managed to get to see most of the animals and they were great! Especially the monkeys. It was fantastic! The place is so enjoyable. I suggest it.,,
,,Visit to the Sakura Festival at Gardens by the Bay,4,,The visit was pleasant. Except that the pickup and drop off for cars is rather far. My elderly parents have to walk quite far to reach the car pickup area. Suggest if you can provide free buggy ride for elderly from the flower dome to the car pickup area. Thanks.,,
,,Many flowers at the cool places,5,,"There are different gardens at the bay. To me, the concern is weather. However, the 2 dimes are air-conditioned and quite cool. Before we entered the first one, we had a fun and hot time at the other gardens. After the first dome, we happily and coldly switched to another open air garden . About another two more fun hours in hot weather, we entered the second cloud dome which was amazing.
We spent a whole day at the gardens happily and it is quite enjoyable especially we could chill us when hot then warm us when cold...",,
,,Don't Miss this amazing place!,5,,"Spend at least a 1/2 day in this beautiful botanic showcase! Truly a major attraction with lots to see and do. Eating places seemed a bit hard to find, but they are there!",,
,,Great evening,4,,With some friends we spent a while in the garden by the bay to intend to the light show. The light show was stunning and very appreciated but we regretted a bit the number of people there.,,
,,Absolutely amazing!,5,,I can't really put into words how beautiful that place is! The display at night was really extraordinary. Beauty :),,
,,Best tourist attraction in Singapore,5,,"Must visit place. Entry to outdoor garden is free where you can enjoy beautiful light shows in the evening. Paid entrance to Cloud Forrest, Flower dome and OCBC Skywalk. Great spots for selfies with Marina Bay Sands in the backdrop.",,
,,Excellant,5,,"This place is amazing. What a country can create one of such things is visible through this garden. Go in the evening after 5pm so that you can enjoy in sunlight as well as after dark when the lights are on as well as watch the light and sound show at 7.40pm.

There are different themed gardens and we came across an acquarium too inside this attraction.",,
,,One of a kind,5,,Must visit this unique sight seeing spot good for the whole family or a romantic date. Trees and plants from around the world can be admired here,,
,,Great Gardens - especially the Cloud Forest and the Super Tree Forest,4,,"The Super Tree Forest is not to be missed, but either go early in the day, or better yet, go just after sunset to enjoy the light show. The Cloud Forest garden was also very impressive while the Flower Garden was less so. Take the time to have a drink atop the biggest tree in the Super tree forest - pretty awesome!",,
,,Review,5,,Garden was in good condition but the place was a bit too crowded due to overwhelming response. But crowd management was handled efficiently.,,
,,Singapore Perfection,5,,"A great day out. Importantly, once I had booked the ticket on GetYourGuide, the voucher that was emailed was an actual ticket to get in. I didn鈥檛 need to exchange it, I didn鈥檛 need to print it. I just ordered it in my phone after we arrived, and saved over S$14. The ticket bar code was then scanned at the entrance. Another tip is to walk to the Satay by the Bay food area. Much much cheaper than the food area near the trees and authentic local food too. If you leave the domes just after 6.00pm you have enough time to eat before the first light show at 7.45pm. Great afternoon and evening.",,
,,amazing vista,5,,There are somethings that you just have to do when you are in certain places in the world. This is one of them.,,
,,It was okay,3,,It was gardens and it was by the bay. It was nothing more and nothing less. Not exactly the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. I can't be enthusiastic about it.,,
,,A Must Go (with kids),5,,we went with a toddler in a tow during the Sakura Matsuri event held. We went to the Cloud Forest & Flower Dome. We were greeted with a Waterfall at the Cloud Forest (timing available). A great introduction of Plants & Flowers to the kids,,
,,Sakura,4,,"Good layout for the Sakura attraction, combined with the Cloud Forest provides a good time for the afternoon and evening.",,
,,Flower dome was awesome!,5,,Originally went to catch the Sakura Matsuri but ended up amazed by the wide variety of other flowers on display! One can easily spend a few hours there admiring the flowers and relaxing in airconditioned comfort. Definitely a must visit! Try to go during the early afternoon as queues start to form from 5+pm!,,
,,Different and wonderful,5,,"This is a must visit spot in Singapore, the living tree sculptures are amazing, you can view them up close on the ground and from the walk ways high up amongst them. The domes also are really beautiful and a lovely cool surprise, especially if you are used to the European domes which are warm or hot when you enter them as these are mountain and Spring domes. If you are short of time go for the Mountain Dome. Also if you get the chance at 7:45 there is a free light, music and laser show, it too is very beautiful.",,
,,too many people there,3,,too many people there. and it was a bit cold... There could be some temperature warming somewhere to help people get prepared.,,
,,Amazing!,5,,What a truly remarkable place to visit. We Times our visit so that we could go inside both the cloud dome and flower dome and then see the magical light show. And we were also lucky enough to be there for the cherry blossom exhibit which looked superb. So pretty with so many flowers. Both domes were great in different ways but were extremely cold. And then to the light show. This really is amazing and something not to be missed. I鈥檓 no green thumb but have to say I really enjoyed my time time in the gardens.,,
,,a must see,5,,"I first went to the Gardens by the Bay 2 days after it opened and was speechless. on this trip it took us all day to go through the 2 domes. something you don't want to miss, so if you like gardens allow 2 days to really enjoy these gardens",,
,,amazing,5,,this is one of those places that if you visit Singapore you have to visit. Best time afternoon so you can stay for the lights in trees show (symphony by the bay). amazing and worth every cent.,,
,,Sakura Flower,3,,"Was hoping to catch the sakura flowers blooming but was a bit disappointed as the place was overcrowded and the flowers are not so grant as expected. However if you are an admirer of flowers, then this should not be a stop to skip.",,
,,Meh.,3,,It was rather dull. I went to the flower dome to see the sakura flowers but it was withering and almost dying. The place was extremely crowded also but we went on a weekend so can't do anything about that.,,
,,Sakura Matsuri @ Gardens by the Bay,5,,"A wonderful opportunity to see the Japanese blooms, without leaving Singapore. It was done beautiful well.",,
,,Splendid,5,,"Exhibits were great! Atmosphere was calming. At the same time, there was the Sakura festival and exhibition going on. Sakura were well kept, and stunning.",,
,,Wow !!!,5,,"This is a must! Quite spectacular. The architecture, lay out and diversity of the plants was amazing. The Flower house and The Cloud are a must. Totally awe inspiring

The tall trees are amazing vertical gardens are spectacular and come into their own at night with a free light and sound fantasia featuring all the theme tunes from the biggest film block busters. The last time I saw something like this was the light parade at Disney.

Recommend to go at the end of the day when the sun is going down and the lights come on

What a way to end a holiday - thank you Singapore!",,
,,A garden to remember,5,,a fantastic garden with exotic plants . If of interest a beautiful place and is well worth the visit,,
,,Sakura festival was great!,4,,Enjoyed a lovely stroll with my husband and 11 month old son at the Sakura festival. Many people - but not as many in Japan!,,
,,Nice setup,5,,Second time here and they always make visitors surprised by outstanding seasonal setup. Nice staff and excellent service.,,
,,SAKURA FAIR,5,,I forgot to bring my ticket. Staffs are very helpful to check and retrieve a copy for me in order to access to the fair. I was mesmerized by the sakura flowers. It was so beautiful and amazing.,,
,,Light show well worth visit,4,,"The gardens are well worth a visit, mostly free but you do have to pay for the skywalk and entry to the 2 domes, all 3 of which are well worth the money, about 40 SGD in all.
The evening Light show was worth a visit on its own.",,
,,Beautiful place to visit,5,,"Went to view sakura flowers for a friend's birthday. The design of the exhibition was well planned as there were multiple species of cherry blossoms that would bloom at different times. We forgot to anticipate how cold the flower dome would be for the cherry blossoms and ended up shivering most of the time. Nevertheless, I would definitely visit again.",,
,,Gorgeous!!!,5,,"Absolutely gorgeous views and flowers. It can get cold in the flower dome, so maybe bring something to keep yourself warm while you're in there. But overall, very well worth it.",,
,,The Sakura Theme for the flower dome,3,,The Sakura theme did not live up to expectation in my opinion. There wasn't much Sakura trees and and the the booth at the centre offer a very small variety of Japanese theme goods and stuff.,,
,,Family Visit to see Sakura,4,,It would be better if there were more varieties of sakura on display. We had a good time with the family.,,
,,Tourist,5,,Great very popular place to go take plenty of time at least half a day. Amazing development try the night lighting exhibition.,,
,,Brilliant!!!,5,,What can I say ! It was a great day out loads to see amazing plants an absolute must. Was totally blown away with the trees and walk ways. Highly recommend the light show 7.45pm. Everyone very friendly and helpful... watch out for all snap happy tourist!,,
,,Enjoyable,5,,"Perfect environment, rain or shine. Weekend crowds was quite terrible at certain places but staff were great in facilitating with human congestion. I like how educational videos were available for cloud forest.",,
,,Inconvenient travel direction,3,,"For the Cloud Forest, the visit direction is fixed and need to go out and re-enter to visit if got some places missed out. A bit inconvenient.",,
,,"Amazing, but will get even better!",5,,"Still under construction, the gardens are wonderful. The 'trees' are larger than you think, some have lifts inside so you can go up to the Skywalk. Lots of interesting plants with sculptures dotted about.The domes are impressive, not unlike the Eden Project or Kew. You can easily spend a day here, the gardens are free you just pay for the domes.",,
,,Alluring garden,4,,"Garden by the bay鈥?One of the main city attractions located at the heart of Singapore鈥檚 new downtown 鈥?Marina Bay. It includes-

Flower dome鈥?Take one to the world of exotic plants from five continents in nine different gardens.

Cloud forest鈥?There was a waterfall cascading down a 35-meter tall mountain covered with plants such as orchids, ferns, begonias and pitcher plants. It was mesmerizing and I liked it more than the flower dome.

Do not miss to watch the music and light show of the Garden by the Bay in evening at 7.45 pm and 8.45 pm.",,
,,Must see attraction,5,,This place makes me feel so happy! Just make sure that you have your phone is fully charged since you will be taking plenty of photos of beautiful flowers and plants. It's the second time I have visited Garden by the Bay and I enjoyed it just as much as I did when I first visited 1 year ago.,,
,,Gardens by the bay,5,,Had an amazing time at the gardens by the bay and would recommend it to everyone as a must. We went into the flower dome and the cloud dome. The cloud dome is exceptional. Our time was very limited and we didn't see much more. It's wheelchair friendly and easily accessible but not clear of the route to take around the domes e.g. we almost missed the theatre,,
,,Great place!,4,,One of the best and most spectacular places in Singapore! A visit during afternoon is recommended if you got the opportunity.,,
,,Delightful evening!,4,,My husband and I went on an organized tour of Gardens by the Bay on our recent visit to Singapore. The evening lightshow was magnificent and the trip up to the observation bay at the top of the Marina Bay Hotel gave a wonderful view of the city by night. The rivercruise from Marina Bay to Clarke Quay added a delightful end to the tour. Our guide was knowledgeable and made it a worthwhile experience. U,,
,,Such a Heaven on Earth,5,,"For you who love trees, flowers, natural things from arround the world, this place is one of the best. You can find some variaties of flower and plant from any continent. These area are so big, consists of 3 major part. There are Flower Dome, Forest Cloud Dome and Supertree grove. I love garden by the bay.",,
,,Amazing .,5,,The gardens are amazing. A lovely garden - many different sections and a large variety of plants. A very nice way to spend a few hours. Definitely worth a visit when in Singapore,,
,,Fun,5,,"Enjoyed the visit to gardens by the bay. Different things to look at, as there were animals walking round and plenty and gardens. Also a water play area for kids.Will return",,
,,Great Conservatory,5,,"Just walking around Gardens by the Bay is free of charge and also great. But as third time visiting here, I for the first time paid for 1 Conservatory ticket. And the artificial water fall, view from the top, walking down seeing variety of plants and flowers were fantastic experience. So well designed and built. Must see it!",,
,,One of the best places,5,,Went here quite some time ago. Family oriented and it was extremely beautiful. Kids love to run about. The Cloud Forest was cooling and exotic. None like you would ever see in Singapore. Just marvelous.,,
,,"If you can visit one site, come here!",5,,"This is the one place you should visit and you can easily spend a whole day here. The gardens, complete with the famous Steel trees are incomparable. Both the cloud forest with its huge indoor waterfall and the plants and flowers will keep you enthralled for hours. The steel trees are a fantastic feature and the canopy walkway is a must for those with a head for heights. Do not forget the amazing light and sound show featuring the trees - amazing!",,
,,Stop over,5,,"We only had two days in Singapore and the gardens were a highlight. We were only able to see the flower dome as the other dome was closed. The flowers are generally in pots and so they are able to display a huge range of flowers, all flowering at the same time. The dome is air conditioned, very welcome after Singapore's heat outside. The levels are easily accessed by following the path and would be suitable for prays and wheelchairs. The outside areas of the gardens are huge. We used the little train to get around. We were able to reach the tree top walk in the Super Tree Grove by lift and really enjoyed walking the suspension bridge between giant metal trees and take in the view of Singapore harbour and the city.",,
,,Definitely worth a visit,4,,"The Gardens are amazing. We particularly enjoyed the audio tour on the little bus, and the Cloud Forest.",,
,,Family visit,5,,"What an experience. We spent an evening and another day touring the whole area. Incredible. Beautifully designed, interesting and impactful. Would advise anyone going to Singapore to head here.",,
,,Beautiful gardens,5,,"You need a minimum of about 2 hours to view both sites. A lovely retreat from the heat outside.It is very cool and relaxing. Flowers and gardens are stunning . A lovely indoor waterfalls. Lots of opportunities for great photos.
At night there is a light show with music daily which is brilliant",,
,,Beautiful Gardens,5,,"We visited on a public holiday so the gardens were very busy, however they absorbed the crowds well. Be prepared for a lot of walking as well as the heat and rain! Truly a great experience and should not be missed!",,
,,Wonderful Cherry Blossoms,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is a great place to go for outings with friends. If you are are Singapore resident, highly recommended to get the 1 year pass.",,
,,Beautiful gardens beautiful flowers,4,,"This place was recommended by friends so we decided to go. We spent the whole day there, walked our legs off . There is a shuttle service available but there is a fee. We did the audio shuttle service and paid SDG $8 per adult. A good way of covering the huge park area. You can hire bicycles as well. Didn鈥檛 do that so not sure how much that was.
Although the main park is free to all - there are two domes which have an entrance fee SGD $28 for adults no discounts for non resident senior citizens . These domes were a worthwhile visit full of attractive
flora . Also the skywalk attracts a fee of SGD $8 per person This was also worth it giving you an elevated view of the gardens and surrounding area. There are information stations dotted about so that is useful .",,
,,A beautiful place,5,,"A lovely garden - many different sections and a large variety of plants. Very well kept and, of course, very clean. There are 2 areas where one can pay to enter. We did not do these due to lack of time, but heard they were both excellent.",,
,,"second visit, crowded but wonderful",5,,"really beautiful but crowded. Extremely cold in both domes, bring a jacket. Satay by the Bay is a great place to eat between domes and light show",,
,,Good Walk,5,,A must when in Singapore to visit but lots of walking so wear a hat and carry water. Much to see and experience .,,
,,Beautiful indoor gardens,5,,"During the two years we lived in Singapore, we visited gardens by the bay for various fun exhibitions. The most impressive one was by far the ""Tulip Mania"" showcasing gorgeous tulips back in 2015. We just visited again in April to see the current Cherry Blossoms, they were a little sparse and starting to finish with blooming. But the gardens themselves are still very impressive, and you should pay a visit to them during you trip to Singapore!",,
,,Well worth visit. Will not be disappointed,5,,Incredible presentation of world standard gardens. Wheelchair access exceptional to all areas. Gardens an absolute delight and pleasure to view. Serene atmosphere and beautiful plants and flowers so well presented.,,
,,Fabulous gardens!,5,,Have never seen anything like these gardens - the Cloud Forest is an absolute must. Every imaginable plant is there - it is just amazing. Also enjoyed a wide array of hawker food for lunch so all in all a wonderful afternoon in fabulous Singapore.,,
,,"Fantastic Experience, an absolute must!",5,,"A fantastic arrangement of gardens that are truely spectacular. Loved the Cloud Forest (one of the best attractions I have ever visited) and the Supertree Grove is wonderful.

Love the use of renewable energy to power the gardens, and especially great (in the Cloud Forest) to cool down.

Would absolutely visit again.",,
,,Spent an amazing day at these gardens,5,,"So much here to see and enjoy, whether you like flowers or forest you will find something to suit everyone. Once again they have done a marvellous job in presentation and very well maintained.",,
,,A place for exploring and relaxing,5,,"We loved it here. It started off a little confusing on the ticketing aide of things but once we got past that we got on with enjoying it. Lots of walking and exploring to do. The flower structures are incredible. The light show in the evening was worth the wait.

There were plenty of food options available throughout the day.

The over zealous approach to shutting everything due to ""inclement weather"" was frustrating and meant we missed out on some things we were really looking forward to.

On reflection I would say do outdoor stuff in the morning and indoor stuff in the afternoon. That way you might avoid the closing due to a few raindrops problem.",,
,,Amazing don鈥檛 miss it,5,,Domes (flower and cloud) are just incredible. Don鈥檛 miss it. Absolute must in Singapore. If you can buy your tickets online in advance to save queuing (we went on Sunday so it was quite busy),,
,,Sunday morning,5,,Another lovely time wandering the amazing gardens. We鈥檝e been coming here for a few years now and have never been disappointed. Friendly staff and beautifully kept.,,
,,Must visit,5,,Gardens by the bay is one of the best free activities in Singapore. You have to pay to enter the forest domes. Visit in the afternoon is recommended. And must see the light and music show @ 7:45. Can cycle around the place.,,
,,Cannot find words to decribe this amazing place,5,,"This was our second visit and it was just as incredible as the first. The use of reclaimed land is unbelieveable the structures are beautiful and so creative. This is a magical place, don't miss it",,
,,Can鈥檛 wait to go back!,5,,We promised ourselves a trip back here having had a glimpse a few years ago. It was worth it. The gardens and the special displays should be on your to do list. Pay to go in to the displays- it is worth every cent. The gardeners and horticulturalists are to be congratulated.,,
,,Oasis,5,,"Beautiful gardens that provide ample habitats for wildlife within in the city! We went several times during our time in Singapore, mainly in the hope of spotting the Bishan otter family and although we were not successful, we did see a lot of other wildlife including a variety of birds and two huge water monitors.

While we weren't lucky enough to see the otters here, it is a really good place to spot them so if you're a wildlife enthusiast like us, it's definitely worth a visit just for that!

The Supertree grove is also really impressive, particularly when you find out the real purpose: They act as exhaust chimneys for the biomass furnaces, and they provide an outlet for steam from dehumidification. They provide the location for solar energy collection, solar heat collection, water collection, whilst at the same time giving shading to the site.

Facilities are good, there's a few places to eat and a good amount of well maintained toilets. It's easy to walk around, lots of very well maintained paths.",,
,,Awesome,5,,This place so awesome. Recommended visit this place at night because there is light show at the night. So romantic place.,,
,,Very Impressive!,5,,A very nice way to spend a few hours. Definitely worth a visit when in Singapore. Very lush plants and the nearby skyline is a total marvel.,,
,,Amazing,5,,"This is just one of the must do things in Singapore -hands down
The dimes themselves are incredible feats of engineering and gardening , and the grounds around displaying a number of garden styles worth half a day-take a picnic wear a hat and get lost in a beautiful space",,
,,Oasis,5,,Not a gardens sort of person but enjoyed my visit to gardens by the bay. Easy access from MRT station both harden domes are airconditioned so can escape Singapore humidity.,,
,,Yes you must see it,4,,Worth going there during the day and at night when they have 2 light and music shows. The walkway was closed due to weather on both times we went even though it wasn鈥檛 raining or windy; strange.,,
,,Fantastic,5,,"I was in awe of the two domes. The cloud dome boggles the imagination with its creativity and structure including a 6 story waterfall. Great flow to be able to see the entire dome even with crowds.

Definitely a must see if you are in Singapore. Unfortunately the tree walk was closed due to inclement weather but looked amazing to be up 16 stories with a fantastic overview.",,
,,Don鈥檛 miss Cloud Forest,5,,Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are definitely the highlights. How in the world do they garden a 6 story tall vertical wall of plants? Allow a minimum of 4 hours and plan on lots of walking.,,
,,very beautiful place is a must on your visit to Singapore,5,,This is a very beautiful place and worth the time when visiting this beautiful city. Also see the light show in the Super Tree grove and visit the Sands Marina hotel and mall. Outstanding!,,
,,Outstanding display of Flora...,5,,"We visited both of the Gardens by the Bay flower domes, one is the cloud forest and the other is a display of flora from all over the world. They both were amazing and incredibly beautiful.",,
,,Very enjoyable,5,,Do as much or little as you want. At 7.45 enjoy the light display as it is superb. There are two domes. I visited the one with the worlds highest indoor waterfall which was interesting,,
,,Fun place to walk around,5,,Really enjoyed our day here. Very pleasant with very little crowding. The conservators were excellent a a great area to get out of the heat! Loves the skywalk excellent views of the city area.,,
,,Amazing park!,5,,"We stayed at Marina Bay Sands right across the street. If you're in Singapore both are a must do! The park is a wonderful place just to walk around and enjoy, and at night they do laser light show that is spectacular!",,
,,Another must do,5,,This is so well organised. Singapore have really got this right. Spent a long time wandering round. Some good eating places as well.,,
,,Better than I expected.,5,,"We stayed at Marina Bay Sands so it was only appropriate to visit Gardens by the Bay. So glad we did what a beautiful place. The lines are mad crazy but once inside there is plenty of room for everyone, even on Good Friday. I would recommend visiting on a weekday to avoid the crowds though. I liked the rain forest dome the best but they are both worth a look.
Was going to add some photos but you have seen them all. The photos don鈥檛 do it justice, go and see it for yourself.",,
,,Singapore Trip 2018,5,,"Recently had a week in Singapore and went to the Gardens By The Bay several times and had the best time, we were unfortunate to not be able to do the Tree Walk during the night light show due to inclement weather. We tried 2 or 3 nights in a row.",,
,,Nice place well worth a visit,4,,"This is a really nice place that is well worth a visit but we found the cooled conservatories $28 per person) and OBC skyway ($8 per person) a bit pricey. Good to know: I think you can still enjoy a fab time just exploring the outdoor gardens - this is free! The Outdoor Gardens consist of: Supertree Grove, Sun Pavillion, Heritage Gardens, World of Plants, Dragonfly & Kingfisher Lakes.",,
,,Sakura Festival was so lovely,5,,We loved the sakura festival because the flowers are so exquisite. We saw different varieties of the sakura. There were also other types of beautiful flowers. It was indeed a very lovely visit.,,
,,Simply amazing,5,,"These gardens are definitely world class if your in Singapore it is a must see. The cloud Forrest and flower dome, just wow!",,
,,beautiful garden in the city,5,,Lovely place. It is amazing how the Gardens were able to grow so many nice and large orchids. However the food places are quite expensive. I wish they lower the prices and make it more reasonable.,,
,,Unique and amazing,4,,"Unique and truly amazing. We were surprised by the pleasant temperature within the domes which are climate controlled. As a garden lover the presentation within the domes and outdoor areas, especially the super trees far surpassed my expectations.
It is a must-see destination in Singapore that I would put at the top of the to-do list in Singapore",,
,,What a great garden and features,5,,"this place is massive and has many features like the blossom and water fall domes and electric trees, however there is a charge to enter. The hidden thing is the Satay food area with loads of outlets which is great fresh cooked and lots of choice.",,
,,Not just for families but also solo can enjoy too,5,,I thik this is a must place to go when you come to Singapore. Very entertaining. There is a shuttle bus from the nearest station but you can walk as well. It was not that far.,,
,,Extraordinary gardens,5,,I have never seen anything like this. It was huge and beautifully crafted. The 2 cool domes were a great relief from the Singapore heat. I loved the wooden sculptures throughout as well.,,
,,Love,5,,"Does anyone even need a recommendation for this place?
Every night there is a light show startig at 7.45, which lasts around 15 mins. Make sure to be up while it lasts cause of the amazing view and experience. To go to the bridge you have to pay 8SGD. By the time you go down and find yourself a place to lay down and enjoy the lights new light show starts at 8.45. Don鈥檛 miss it. Breathtaking.",,
,,Catch the Light Show,5,,"We went on an organised tour, (not necessary) the gardens are amazing, plenty to do & take time to wander, the views from the super-tree bistro or bar are fantastic ( entry 20sd one free drink,) you CAN鈥橳 see the light show from the top !!! It starts @ 7.45.there are Shops, bars, restaurants & facilities. The areas are very well sign posted, well staffed, safe & clean.",,
,,The excellent cloud forest,4,,We really enjoyed this and spent most of our time at the cloud forest. We took a lift up to the top and walked down amongst all the trees and flowers. We went to the flower dome next but it was too busy to enjoy and just personal taste but one dome was enough for us. We then saw the light show which was well worth it,,
,,Amazing!,5,,"We made sure to see it during the day and be there for the night light show in the Supertree area. Both times are great and you see totally different things. There are species here that are not seen in other gardens. The technology of the Supertrees is amazing. The only costs are if you want to take the audio tour($8)on the carts or go in the enclosed domes($8). The flower dome was more fabulous than any botanic garden I have ever seen. It is definitely a don鈥檛 miss. The Cloud dome was ok but not near as good as the Flower Dome. The night light show is put to music. There are numerous dining options but none of them are above average.
Definitely a don鈥檛 miss.",,
,,Unique Botanic project,5,,"The Gardens by the bay includes several sites. The Supertree grove, Cloud Forest dome, Flower dome and the park itself. It is a botanic garden and you can spend all day touring and refreshing your soul combining all the atrractions at the park.",,
,,"2018 Sakura Festival at Gardens by the Bay, Singapore",5,,"Awesome! We enjoyed ourselves very much inside the Flower Dome. We wore our own Yukata and went to Gardens by the Bay and it was awesome! We all love the it! Already felt like we were in Japan for that moment as the Flower Dome was cold and Sakura was real. Nice Japanese food, photo sessions and good photos taken with the Sakura. We even have tourist who took pictures with us as we are all dress up in Yukata as a group. We will come again next year!",,
,,A beautiful garden setting and experiences!,5,,"What a nice activity on a hot day in Singapore.
Flower pavilion was in cherry blossom full bloom. Thousands of flowers and trees to choose some favorites. Temps inside were a chilly spring like day.
Cloud Pavillion was a unique experience with a huge waterfall and flowers and trees in the moist habitat.
Went back for the light show at night, lights synchrized to music for 15 minutes of viewing. Very nice!",,
,,Gobsmackingly Gorgeous,5,,"You could literally spend days at this place, we only got to see the domes and aride around on the cart. We got it a little cheaper by booking online through our hotel. The domes are air conditioned and are a talking point in itself the way it is all powered. It really is a place not to be missed, and as with Singapore every time you visit there is something different to see, so I will return again to the domes to see the difference when we next get to visit Singapore.",,
,,Wonderful displays,5,,I was fortunate yo visit the Gardens On the Bay during the Sukara exhibit. The cherry blossoms were exquisite. I also really enjoyed the succulent garden displays. Everything was beautiful. It is an indoor exhibit and it was a bit cool compared to the outside air so consider bringing along a light jacket or wrap. Don't miss the giant tree sculptures on the grounds. Both day & night they are beautiful.,,
,,Amazing but HOT,5,,"Totally a must see when visiting the city

The super trees need to be seen with your own eyes to be believed!

Both conservatories are like little oasis....and the outdoor spaces are a nice place to be away from the skyscrapers

If you don鈥檛 like the heat, take some sort of shade umbrella and water.....I nearly melted",,
,,Beautiful colorful travel through the hypnotic musical gardens!,5,,"What a experience!
You gotta be here twice, once during the day and once at night for the musical light show. I laid on the floor just watching the show and I got totally lost in the colors, lights, music and patterns... felt like the time just was nothing.",,
,,Quite spectacular and free!,4,,"The 7.45pm and 8.45pm light shows are free and excellent.
Well worth a visit,the light and music show lasts around 10 mins and highly recommended. Visited for the second time and just as good as the first
You get to the Gardens by the bay through the iconic Bay Sands Hotel. The garden towers are metal structures covered in vivid plant life and evening time is best as they are beautifully lit. Great ! But very busy and you suffer from crowding.",,
,,A must do,5,,"Definitely recommend a trip to gardens by the bay. Forest in the clouds was my favourite part, flower garden was just too busy. Even if you don't visit the conservatories just walking around the gardens is a pleasant way to spend a few hours",,
,,"Gardens by the bay, Singapore - Flower Dome, Rain Forest & Super Tree Grove",5,,"One fuzzy circle surrounded by soft petals can take your breath away. Imagine a 250-acre sprawl of flowers. I was lost in a fragrant paradise, except that it was right on earth 鈥?Gardens by the Bay in Singapore. One day is not enough to feast your eyes on the vibrant floral carpet that seems to sprawl into infinity.

Here, flowers gather in astoundingly beautiful forms. One of them is the floral dome that paints the greenhouse in mesmerizing hues. Did I mention that it is the world鈥檚 largest glass greenhouse?

鈥淚 was surprised to spot ladies鈥?ear drops. Then I realized that Mother Nature had opened up her jewel box 鈥?these ear drops鈥?are uniquely shaped fuchsia flowers. The name of this colour is derived from the flower鈥檚 name鈥?

I also saw colourful inverted bulbs standing on stalks. Surprisingly they had 鈥榣ips鈥?in their name. Of course, I am talking about tulips. Then I spotted gorgeous flowers with concentric circles of petals in varying shades of pink. I rediscovered the Dahlia, all over again. There was also a generous sprinkling of prose-inspiring roses.

I wandered out of the greenhouse and into the rainforest. Yes, you read that right! It was a lush rainforest nestled in a garden. There was a 35-metre waterfall draped in a skirt of gushing water decorated with ferns and orchids. Flaming crimson flamingo flowers were dancing around. This is also known as the Anthurium flower. The vibrant colour palette was made complete by purple orchids and yellow butterflies. Surprisingly, these butterflies wear petals with wine-coloured spots. These flowers are also known as Oncostele Wildcats.

Insects drink from some flowers but there are petal-wearing carnivores that insects wouldn鈥檛 dare to touch. The Venus Flytrap looked like a bunch of long-toothed mouths ready to swallow adventurous insects. The Pitcher plant looked like a tube waiting for a curious insect to take a peek. That would be the most dangerous peek ever. This was a little overwhelming for me.

I turned my attention to a pink pineapple. Then, I did a double take. It was a blushing ginger lily. Sometimes, the Creator enjoys surprising us. Speaking of surprises, I spotted a lady鈥檚 slipper. For a moment, I looked around for Cinderella. Then I realized that the slipper was, in fact, an orchid鈥?

Then I chanced upon the most amazing sight. Giant trees rose all around me. There was something incredibly unique about these trees. Their roots seemed to stick in the air. I found that they were not made of wood but solar photovoltaic cells to harvest energy from the sun. The trees were covered by over 200 varieties of bromeliads, orchids and ferns and tropical flowering climbers. It was a stunning example of vertical gardening. At night, the trees glowed like giant optic-fibre torches. A 22-metre high OCBC Skyway gracefully curved between two of the Super Trees. It was an irresistible invitation to enjoy a view of the garden from the top of a tree.

I didn鈥檛 have the heart to leave Gardens by the Bay, so I stayed back for one last spectacle 鈥?the Garden Rhapsody show. There are two shows, one at 7.45pm and the second at 8.45pm. The light show is free 鈥?no tickets are required.

I finally ticked Gardens by the Bay off my bucket list. It should be on yours if it isn鈥檛 already. You can make an online booking for this once-in-a-lifetime experience at Gardens by the bay or visitsingapore and enjoy good deals. Look forward to a great deal of fun!",,
,,Good to visit in evening,4,,It is good to visit in evening. The garden with waterfall is good. But small kids are not that keen in this.,,
,,Not many restaurants to choose. Overall good experience.,5,,"It鈥檚 a beautiful place, my kids love to see colourful flowers. Not many restaurants to choose. Overall good experience.",,
,,Sakura Matsuri Theme,5,,"At the Flower Dome, we saw lots of beautiful sakura flowers in various colours. From March 16 to April 8, it was Sakura Matsuri theme. It was cool and nice in the dome.
Before you go and view the sakura, you can rent the yukata and clogs at $10 for adult. We saw so many ladies wearing the yukata and taking photos.
There are wheelchairs available and lockers to store your shopping which you may not want to lug around.
If you have not been to the Flower Dome, you can do so till 8 April.
If you book online like i did, i got a special price at S$10.20 (adult) and S$7.20 for seniors above 60years old (Spore resident).

We will go again to see Tulipmania from 13 April to 13 May.",,
,,A bit mixed,4,,"This is probably worth a visit. The domes were fantastic- but they cost $28 per person. The garden itself is free to wander around in, but imho the Botanical Gardens are a better bet for a free garden stroll. There's food that's pretty average, and the service seemed to lack that Singapore warmth a little. If you go then you really should stay for the light show ... but make a point of hurrying to the taxi rank the moment it finishes to avoid the 50 metre long queue.",,
,,Stunning curated gardens,5,,"If you want curated gardens full of the most amazing flora from across the region and around the world, GBTB is the place to visit.

The two conservatories offer very different experiences; one offers a rainforest experience full of exotic plants surrounding a large waterfall, and the other a curated landscape of plants from around the world. As a British resident, I found it funny to see the humble daffodil amongst the plants but they really do showcase flowers from all regions.

There's a kids garden with a bit of a water play area so bring your trunks for some water play. You'll also see a kids cafe for child friendly dining (although there is also a McDonald's on site).

You can't talk about GBTB without mentioning Supertree Grove. These enormous man made trees come to light every night at 8-9pm which is a must see for all visitors. Don't miss out on this spectacle.

All in all, GBTB is one of the highlights of my visit and I'd recommend doing both conservatories as they are worth the entrance fee. If you are working on a budget and don't want to pay for entry, I'd say you should explore the grounds for free because there is still a great deal to see at Gardens At The Bay.",,
,,Stunning gardens & glasshouses,5,,"You can see that a lot of money has gone into creating these gardens in the grounds of the Marina Bay Hotel.

The outside gardens are free to visit & are pleasant enough. Try to to be there in the evening for the 'Garden Rhapsody' where the Supertree Grove explodes in colour, lights & music in high quality enjoyable show.

The real highlight is the glass houses, the Cloud Forest & Flower Dome are world class.",,
,,Botanic garden in air-conditioned comfort,5,,"Where can you find a collection of amazing flowers and plants from different continents(tropical rainforest to desert) in Singapore without the discomfort of hot and humid climate?
Gardens by the Bay had created the ""outdoor"" garden ""indoor"" ! no sweat!
There is so much to see, ideal for the whole family, carefully designed for prams and wheelchairs. you will need a full day or more!
Do not miss the award winning orchid garden!
For the scientific minded, some would wonder how the established flora flourished without the birds and the bees. my advice is Just enjoy the sight and marvel at how innovative the Singaporeans have created this world class wonder
You can also relax for a break in the cafe, or venture outside the dome for light meal nearby in the complex",,
,,Blooms in Domes,4,,"Gardens by the Bay is a much welcome addition to Singapore's many interesting and great attractions. Given our limited time, we decided to focus our visit to the conservatories, the flower dome and the cloud forest dome.

The flower dome is a refreshing site. When we were there, there were many visitors who were obviously delighted as we were at the sight of blooms, cacti, thousand year-old olive trees and baobabs. I haven't been to Japan yet, and so the cherry
blossoms were something to behold.

The cloud forest dome features a man-made mountain and waterfall some 30 meters high. To
appreciate it, you go up to level 7 and go down a
concrete walkway while taking in the sights of orchids, ferns and other tropical plants.

What's unique about these attractions are that they are enclosed in air-conditioned domes. This tempts one to tarry longer to fully appreciate what these have to offer.

There are other attractions that we should have visited if we had ample time. You have the Skyway and Supertrees, World of Plants, Heritage Gardens that features, among others, the Far East Organization's Children's Garden.

For S$ 28 for the 2 conservatories, entrance is quite cheap for what the place has to offer. So, if you're in Singapore, the Gardens by the Bay should be in your must-see list.",,
,,Such an amazing place!!!,5,,I really enjoy my visit here as the Flower wer Dome & Cloud Forest are such an amazing place! All the flowers are pretty & the environment are well kept too.. Definitely worth it to come here as a nature's lover 馃槏,,
,,large botanic garden and more,4,,"we had a free pass but did not go to the part with an entrance fee, because we were exhausted. the temperature was 32 degrees in the shadow, felt like 37 (said our weather forecast) because of the humidity which was over 90%. Ever the free part was very nice - and large",,
,,"Gorgeous ""garden""",5,,"It's actually a huge space/garden including the cloud forest, dome, supertree grove etc. The aforementioned are the most popular and ticketed, but there are 10 other free attractions worth a walk

Each evening, experience the supertree grove light show

Probably the only one of its kind in the world",,
,,A definite highlight to enjoy!,5,,"When a 87yrs young senior with a walker can enjoy the awesome sights at the Gardens by the Bay, it says a lot about the ease of the available amenities and sights. Tis a definite goer to enjoy the beautiful nature of the gardens of the world in a single place.",,
,,Fantastic Visit,5,,"Most amazing gardens our family has visited, very thoughtful design and facilities - our kids enjoyed the kids water park very much! it was especially good especially after the hot hot walk we took touring the outdoor gardens. the flower and cloud domes were great as well, very cooling and houses very interesting plants. toilets were everywhere and even hidden behind some plants - the kids enjoyed 'hunting' for toilets! we were very lucky to see the sakuras and the free guided tours about sakuras were very informative for us, while kids enjoyed looking at the dolls in kimonos and making up their own stories. Highly recommended - a must visit when in Singapour!",,
,,Has to be seen!,5,,Amazing gardens. The 2 domes were awesome and we spent at least 4 hours wondering around looking at the most beautiful gardens. The ticket allows you to come back at night to see and hear the light show using the large metal trees.Brilliant.,,
,,An absolute gem.,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is indeed an absolute gem, in fact an absolute treasure. Be advised to take your time in experiencing this wonderland of colour and sheer enjoyment. What more can one say - just a terrific experience.",,
,,I'm not much into gardens but this place was amazing !,5,,"Normally I'm not into gardens...I kind of find them a bit boring...but...this garden was different. after walking around in the Singaporean heat all day long...this garden was a welcome place to come to by anyones standards...it was refreshingly cool inside...the water-fall was a great Kodak moment to take photos...and their are millions of plants in the glass dome. The walk-way was a bit scary for some...but that added some thrill to what normally is a boring garden.

It was a great walk through with plenty to see...at the end they have a very good video of the estimated timeline for our earths climate change (and what might happen to the earth during this change)",,
,,gardens by the bay,5,,"OMG Brilliant , this was one of the highlights of our trip ,truly amazing, colourful, very very clever. the amount of people gathered around for this event nightly was amazing, you can't help but just go back and see this night after night. The area was safe, clean and free from harassment which in todays world is fantastic. everyone was in awe the whole time the show was on, truly a great mind thought of this well done Singapore you have excelled again xxx",,
,,Astonishing,5,,"Visiting again and it worth it, with breathtaking view to 3 directions. Recommended in every weather",,
,,a must,5,,"each time I am in SGP I go there, this is a must - the super trees, the sky wal, botanic garden, climatic zones around a mountain, everything perfect, not so easy to go there, however one can afford a taxi in SGP",,
,,A beautiful experience with flowers,3,,A beautiful experience of world flowers in one dome. I got to see Sakura cherry blossom and its tradition and culture.,,
,,Awesome sight at night.,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is absolutely awe inspiring. We stayed at Marina Bay Sands which has a walkway there. Ride the lift up six floors and take the walkway across the lobby to the Gardens. There is a suspension walkway connecting some of the trees that is well worth the $8.
Walk thru the gardens by day and stand on the Marina Bay Sands walkway for the light and music show at night. Absolutely magical.",,
,,Great Place,5,,If you come to visit Singapore don鈥檛 forget to visit Garden by the bay. I and my aunty enjoyed the show very much!,,
,,A must for any visit to Singapore,5,,"Considering these gardens are all on recently reclaimed land, the maturity of the plants is staggering. These are exquisite gardens that show tropical plants at their best and provide a welcome oasis from the humidity of the city. If real pants aren鈥檛 your thing, go for the waterfall and sky walk and the outdoor man made sky trees!",,
,,Great Nature Park,4,,Great Place to feel nature must visit to access world wide flowers and trees. Light show also great attraction for evening.,,
,,Stunning,5,,"Doesn't matter what time of day you visit the gardens are stunning. The domes have such a diverse range of plants and trees that the colours blend into this amazing scene that is hard to match to other attractions. You have access to water, which is essential to a garden, through the waterfall and it's an element present everywhere you go. The high walk was a great experience, but even just wandering around the gardens is a highlight. It is easy to get to an access with a pram as well for those who are wondering.",,
,,Do not miss this place!!,5,,One of the best places I have visited in my life. Do not go to Singapore and miss this place. So many things to see including the cloud forest and flower dome.,,
,,Stunning gardens with something for everyone,5,,"These gardens ahve only been here for 5 years but already give the appearance of being fully mature. The Cloud Forest and the Flower Pavilion are both extraordinary for their range of plants and the way they are presented. There is a sky walk which is fun, with great views over the harbour and the city, and the themed country gardens are very thoughtfully laid out. It is easy to spend a lot of time here.",,
,,Not your average gardens,5,,Visited with my family - whilst pretty humid to walk around the outside areas the interior and in particular the cherry blossom was stunning. The gardens are well laid out and accessible for all. Worth a visit.,,
,,Fantastic,5,,Great place to spend some time away from the busy world of Singapore. Words can鈥檛 describe how amazing it all looked at night! Definitely worth the trip for the light display.,,
,,A good way to spend a few hours but not that interesting for teenagers,4,,If you like looking at plants and nature then this is a good place to visit. Teenagers may find it a bit boring. The gardens are beautiful to look at.,,
,,Beautiful and busy,3,,Beautiful but crowded - we cut our viewing short due to the fact that crowd control measures (cattle grids) inside the venues prevented us from actually viewing the plants on multiple occasions. Our fault for going during peak season!,,
,,Don't miss this,5,,Loved it. A must do in Singapore!! Easy to access by taxi. Prebook your tickets and skip the lines. Great for all ages!,,
,,Beautiful gardens,4,,"We visited the gardens for a few hours, the flower dome and the rainforest dome is wonderfull, a lot to see there. Very crowded and very cold inside the domes, very hot outside. The light show is nice.",,
,,Just amazing!,5,,"So well planned and interesting, even if you're not usually into plants and flowers. Good value too. Amazing how they get plants from across the world to bloom at the same time even though they are from totally different environments!",,
,,Nice Place,4,,Do not visit during the weekend or holidays and buy tickets online to avoid the line. Very relaxing if not so many people. Try also the guided tour so you will have information about the place.,,
,,Eighth Miracle of the World,5,,"This gardens is Eighth Miracle of the World. Half a million plants of 2,200 species and the world's tallest waterfall in the rainforest under the roof. Enjoying coolness makes it possible to have a freshen up. You need to visit this place in Singapore.",,
,,Well done,5,,This place is a must see even if you don't have much time. You can walk around for free. With more time and money you can visit the special areas.,,
,,Incredible,5,,"Beautiful by day, even better at night. Our four year old boy loved this place, definitely recommended.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,Simply a terrific trip. Absolutely amazing place that was a great time given it was cherry blossom time. worth taking the trolley to the gardens,,
,,Just magical,5,,"Just magical. A must visit for old and young alike. Both Cloud Forest and Flower Dome are a must. We visited Cherry Blossom time and is was stunning. The time you take to go through takes you through a myriad of wonderful flowers and bushes and then into the Cloud Forest for a walk amongst the foliage in a more cooler tropical temp, was most impressive. A walk to the Supertree Grove is a must as enchanting and a must is the night show here as well. Definitely not one to be missed",,
,,Must see,5,,This is a must see at night as well as during the day And by boat in the evening Would say best thing in Singapore,,
,,Sakura,5,,I am sakura lover. I totally love it alot and having event at there. Last year i went there is no event at all and went in wrong timing. After buying then the staff tell me that sakura is not ready but now i am very happy to see all this ^^ at the same time i can rent yutaka to walk around. I am really very happy ^^ thank you so much ^^,,
,,The best part of Singapore!,5,,"WOW! this place is one of the most amazing things I have ever seen! I visited Gardens by the Bay three times whilst I was in Singapore. The best part is that most of the park is free to enter, you only have to buy tickets to enter the Flower Dome, Cloud Forest and the Skyway. If you just want to walk around the park and then at night watch the light shower it is completely free! I would recommend a visit to this place for everyone, young or old! make sure you go and see the light show too, it鈥檚 magical!",,
,,Beautiful gardens,5,,I loved the indoor gardens. Such a huge variety of plants - the most beautiful being the Singapore orchids. But there were also lots of different cacti. The air conditioning was a very welcome relief from the humidity outside. Plenty of opportunities for amazing photos and selfies. Easy access for wheelchair.,,
,,Visit the Domes!,4,,"There are two indoor gardens at the Gardens by the Bay 鈥?the Flower Garden and the Cloud Garden. They require tickets, but are well worth the price of admission. No matter how I describe it to you, I will not do these experiences justice. The Flower Garden had flowers from all over the world, arranged in different mini-gardens, each following a theme. The first was called Aloes in Wonderland. Aloes and cacti of wondrous variety, with little statues of Alice, the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, and the Queen of Hearts all tucked in and around the plants. There were also giant wooden mushrooms carved out of something that looked like driftwood, with a marvelous texture. Those driftwood carvings greeted us at other times as we toured the gardens 鈥?carved into eagles, lions, dragons, and other fantastic creatures. We visited at the end of one of the special exhibitions, so did not get to see the full glory - but this garden was still beyond beautiful.

The Cloud Garden was even more fantastic, in a whole new way; it was a multi-story tower (maybe 7 levels?) of hundreds of different flowers, vines, trees, shrubbery, with carvings and statues of animals hidden in them. Gusts of vapor blew at the higher levels, simulating clouds. You take an elevator to the top and then wind your way down a ramp to explore the plants, the views, and interior exhibits. The most delightful thing was how the designers built in the element of surprise 鈥?waterfalls or carvings would be partially visible, and you鈥檇 think you were seeing just, say, an eagle鈥檚 head鈥?but when you turned the corner you realized that the eagle was next to a rhino, and a zebra, and the sun. Or you鈥檇 be walking along admiring the colorful flowers and suddenly come into the crystal room, with natural stalagmites and stalagtites scattered around and above you. I marveled at the complexity of design 鈥?and then remembered that this garden was just a small percentage of the whole complex of gardens, hotels, malls, and water features. Acres and acres of complex and intricate design. I was in awe.

Both the domes are downright COLD inside - a welcome respite from Singapore's heat and humidity. You may want to bring a jacket or light sweater.",,
,,"Sitting under the Super Tree, watching the light show was a highlight of our visit to Singapore",5,,"I was prepared to find Gardens by the Bay overly touristy but it was really quite amazing. You can walk through the outside gardens including through the SuperTree grove without paying any entrance fee. A ticket is required for the two domes and are well worth the price of admission. It was hard to decide which was more interesting, the Flower Dome or the Cloud Forest. As I'm partial to flowers, the special display of blooming cherry trees trees made the Flower Dome a wonderful spot to see flower displays from every continent. The Cloud Forest has a 35 meter waterfall, and walkways that circle the dome. Finding a spot to stretch out under one of the SuperTrees, listening to the music and looking at the light show called Garden Rhapsody was a terrific way to end our visit.",,
,,I felt a bit bored,3,,"I know it is an amazing place ,but when compared to Universal or Sentosa or any other major attraction.it was not exciting enough. The cloud forest is amazing,and even Garden By the Bay is must visit if you are a plant enthusiast.",,
,,Truly stunning,5,,"Truly stunning both day and night, an absolute must see.

Wander by day through the various themed gardens. You can buy tickets to walk through the tree tops (I鈥檇 thoroughly recommend) you get amazing views over Singapore and the gardens!

By night there are two light shows, and all I can say is wow.
Really really beautiful and so other worldly, you feel like you鈥檙e in a movie!

You cannot leave Singapore without visiting!",,
,,Better than expected,4,,"I went with my baby because we had nothing better to do that day, and frankly the place turned out to be a nice surprise. It's beautiful and colourful - full of greens and flowers. Try going in the evening when they add colorful lights to the greens. My baby too enjoyed the visit quite a bit!",,
,,Beautifully crafted gardens,4,,An oasis in the middle of a modern metropolis. The crowds were massive; probably due to the holidays. Try to make visits during weekdays. The Easter weekend saw a Japanese Cherry Blossom festival at the gardens. truly unique.,,
,,Amazing Gardens,5,,Unusual gardens well worth a visit if you have one or more hours to spare in Singapore. Besides the flowers there are numerous statues and water features.,,
,,The air is different here!,5,,"I went here to scout out the location of the Super Trees and it was such a beautiful experience. I opted not to go into the green houses because the lines were ridiculous so I strolled through the gardens and hung out at Super Tree. They offer a light show at 8pm which I watched nightly from my room but it was so impressive to be up close to the trees. There are opportunities for beautiful photos at every turn and its a place where even a novice photographer could get relatively impressive shots. The gardens are free to enter unless you want to go into the green houses or the bridge in the canopy of the Super Trees. This would make a great family outing. There are areas to picnic and just relax if you need to. There is also a water park on site for the kiddos as well. If you ever find yourself in Singapore, I highly suggest it!

Not so humbly submitted,
Michael C.",,
,,Visit not to be missed,5,,"We visited the gardens at around mid afternoon and where lucky to be able to visit the Japanese Cheery Blossom exhibition.
The Gardens by the Bay are very well worth the visit and has been developed with much attention to detail catering for all ages and above all very friendly relaxing atmosphere. Most of the gardens are free except the rainforest cloud, flower garden and Supertree Grove skywalk.
Definitely stay for the Supertree Grove light show early evening it beautifully done
Great place to eat after is the Satay at the bay, a food court made up of a number of eateries of local food",,
,,Highlight of Singapore visit.,5,,"Wow! What a special experience. This is a NO miss. Great for all ages. Wonders of nature and man working together. There are 2 incredible domes with flowers and plants that are so well laid out. It鈥檚 really unbelievable. And on a hot Sing day, oh so refreshing! The night show is about 10 long. Good if it鈥檚 not out of your way. They need to change the music to something a little more sophisticated than Disney or Westerns though. Worth seeing.",,
,,Great view from high trees,5,,"This place is worth to visit when you are in Singapore not quite far from Merlion park. You can walk around to visit garden, special high trees - you must buy ticket to get on. It takes about 2 hours to visit all places in garden then you can take MRT to back hotel",,
,,A must-visit!,5,,"This was the highlight of my time in Singapore. It's a billion dollar botanical garden, part of the city's strategy to transform Singapore in to a Garden City. It's free to visit except for the two huge domed conservatories (a ticket to visit both costs $28) which are superb inside.

One of the domes is the 'Flower Dome', the largest columnless glasshouse in the world which replicates the dry climates of the Mediterranean, Australia and South America. It was a kaleidoscope of colour with exotic flowers and plants all around, some of which looked too bizarre to be true. It's possible to download an App which tells you what each flower is. The second dome is 'Cloud Forest' which replicates the cool, moist conditions from tropical mountain regions like SE Asia and middle America. When we walked in we were confronted by its spectacular centrepiece, a man-made mountain containing the world's tallest indoor waterfall. It was quite an impact walking in, being met by the blast of air from the falling water and the cooling spray.

The most recognisable sight at Gardens By The Bay are the garden of futuristic techno-trees. They are between 25 and 50 meters tall and aren't just interesting to look at, they are the environmental 'engines' for the gardens, harnessing solar energy for the lighting, collecting rain water for cooling, irrigation and fountains and providing air for the cooling systems in the domes. The whole park has been designed to minimise environmental impact. Twice a night these trees have a light show, so at 7.45pm the music began and hundreds ooohed and aaahed to the show, which was like a firework display.

There is far more to explore in this brilliant attraction - I felt we barely skimmed the surface. You could easily spend a whole day here.",,
,,Flower Dome & Cloud Forest,5,,"Yet another wonderful experience in Singapore. Its been done in such a way and maintained as well , only truly devoted could do so.The variety of flowers and trees , the water falls, are breath taking. Keep atleat3 hours to enjoy these treats.",,
,,Group of 16,5,,Just stunning - especially the blossom in the Flower Dome and Light Show but make sure you have transport arranged after. Long wait for taxis.,,
,,A Garden Masterpiece,5,,"This is a must do if you are into photography or just love nature. Be prepared to walk a lot so you can take in the various Gardens they offer. Along the way there are numerous sculptures and carvings that you will want to get a picture. Gardens are FREE but if you wish to enjoy the Flower Dome, Cloud Forest, walk along the Skyway in the Supertree Grove and take the shuttle from the ticket center outside the Bayside MRT, the cost is currently $31 in USD. Allow a minimum of 3 hrs but be prepared to spend 4-5 hrs.",,
,,Fantastic!,5,,"What an amazing experience! The gardens by the bay were fantastic. Just walking around is free, the scenery was wonderful. We paid to go into the cloud forest bio-dome and it did not disappoint! I strongly suggest anyone coming to Singapore pays a visit here.",,
,,Afternoon Excursion,5,,"Took my neice whose visiting from the UK, she was awe struck. I have visited many time before too but this time the cloud forest had a water spray floating down from the top which made it all misty and dreamy. The japanese blossom exhibit at the flower dome was another hit. My daughter whose 5 tried her hand at origami which she thouroughly enjoyed. Was a weekday so not too busy and we were able to take our time and took lots of memorable photos. A fabulous day out for all ages, highly recommended.",,
,,Beautiful park,5,,its a beautiful park built on the reclaimed land and is perfect place for spending time with family and children. Is a master piece in construction and is a very perfectly designed place.,,
,,Cool light show,4,,It鈥檚 a cool concept and the light show at night was fun. In the midst of a busy city the gardens are an oasis of calm!,,
,,Beautiful place,5,,"Beautiful gardens, neat and tidy with the stunning super trees in the middle. Plenty of shade to escape the hot sun. The conservatories are cooled and a welcome relief from the hot humid outdoors. The waterfall inside is a show stopper as soon as you walk in. The high walkway gives fabulous views. The Supertrees at night are amazing. My favourite place in Singapore!",,
,,Amazing display of nature,5,,"The easiest way to get there it by MRT. In the one glass dome is a rain forest with a waterfall and in the other glass dome you can see a great variety of plants from all over the world. Both are amazing, but maybe you want to take a jacket with you, it is awfully cold in there.
At night is is especially amazing to see the artificial trees, lighted in different colors.
This place is a most for every visitor of Singapore!",,
,,Good place for photos,3,,Very nice view at night. You can enjoy peace and tranquility. You can get good food and good experience here.,,
,,Awesome,5,,"It can't be missed, it is very well organized, neat and beautiful! Prepare to spend the day there if you want to enjoy all the areas.",,
,,The Future is Here!,5,,Walking through this park was surreal. The way it's designed made me feel like I was walking in some sci-fi film and I loved every minute of it.,,
,,Beautiful,5,,Awesome place to walk around. I went there during evening time and there was wonderful lighting and music. One must visit this place and experience the awesome environment.,,
,,Quick visit at night and totally worth it!,5,,This is of course one of the top attractions in Singapore. It was so magic to be there like you are in avatar.,,
,,Singapore Gardens by the Bay,5,,Wow this was an experience that I really did on my own .The themes were amazing and all the plants and the beautiful flowers and going up to the walkways and look out over the city was amazing as well worth a look my only regret was not doing a night tour of the Gardens by the Bay next time.,,
,,Wow!,5,,"04/04/18

Just incredible!

Definitely go in the evening or once the su has set. There are 2 light and sound shows at 7:45pm and 8:45pm and it really is a must see! Everyone is just silent and in awe!

So you can get tickets to walk on the high bridges through the tree tops (which sell out really quickly on a first come first serve basis) but honestly you don鈥檛 get the best view of the features during the light and sound show. I would recommend just lying down at the bottom of the trees to get the best view of them.

The gardens themselves are just absolutely stunning and it鈥檚 one of my favourite things to do here in Singapore.

There are also some amazing views and photo opportunities so do take advantage of them!

You can then walk over to the Lava bar afterwards for a cheeky (expensive) cocktail!",,
,,sakura,5,,Bought 2 tickets from gardens by the bay website and got discount for senior citizen. Great experience at gardens by the bay. Felt like as if i went to Japan to see sakura! Worth it!,,
,,Contemporary garden,4,,"This new , modernized, and contemporary garden is made of new ways of clinging and hanging colorful and fresh looked indoor and outdoor plants. It I鈥檇 designed for modern cities and fits to the technological world that sees the future of the new generation of the contemporary style.",,
,,Cherry Blossoms in Singapore!,5,,Was fortunate to catch the Cherry Blossom Festival at the Gardens by the Bay. There were several varieties of cherry trees in full bloom along with some Japanese landmarks interjected between the cherry trees. Such a cherry blossom wonderland!,,
,,Japanese flowers exhibition,5,,"Continues to maintain its quality, cleanliness and offer something unique that pulls the crowd. It was extremely crowded probably due to Easter weekend but the staff was managing the situation very well. Every visit to Gardens increases its attractiveness.",,
,,Afternoon evening,5,,"Excellent attraction, especially worth visiting of an evening due to the lighting which gives it a magical look",,
,,Beautiful place to stroll around.,5,,"What a great place to stroll around.
The nightly light show is a highlight and I recommend getting there early to find a good seating spot.
Spend the afternoon walking through the gardens, maybe check out the two domes if you like plant/flower displays and finish with the light show before heading to dinner",,
,,Breathtaking!!,5,,"So glad we came here...
One of the best attractions I have seen anywhere!
Spent 4 hours here and time went so quickly!
We toured the Cloud Forest and the Flower Gardens.
Never seen anything like it.
We went early, so did not have crowds to contend with.
Flowers are just amazing and so much beautiful sculpture.
The grounds are immaculate and we walked over to the Marina Bay Sands via the bridge.
This is a 鈥渕ust see鈥?when visiting Singapore!!",,
,,Garden by the bay,5,,"Cherry blossom is beautiful. Thanks to Garden by the Bay bringing this into Singapore, so we can also enjoy the moment in the tropical country!",,
,,Gardens By The Bay,5,,"Went to the flower dome to view sakura in the sakura matsuri event run by the Gardens by the Bay. The ambience was good, it made me feel as if I was in Japan and the decoration and the line up of the flowers was great and was part of the reason that made me feel as if I was in Japan.",,
,,A must do in singapore,5,,This is by far my favorite place in Singapore. I have visited garden by the bay 4 times and I love every visit. It tends to be more crowded in the evening as people wants to see the lightup and supertree. If you want to beat the crowd then visit it early in the morning.,,
,,On your to do list.,5,,Definitely a place to visit. Try to arrange to be there at afternoon so you can stay up to night and see the light show on the man made trees,,
,,Absolutely stunning.,5,,"If you don't have time to see much of the city, make this your first priority. Beautiful indoor and outdoor imaginative garden creations with some genuinely breathtaking features. Easily accessible via public transport, several cafes, bars and restaurants on site.",,
,,Go see its lovely,4,,"This place is just incredible, the design the layout just amazing that they have managed to get so many different plants together in one place.",,
,,Love the flowers? This is for you,5,,I had visited this recently and keep this in your itinerary on the day when you wish to walk and relax.,,
,,Excellent visit,5,,My son and I visited the Gardens By the Bay and were impressed by the amazing botanical displays. This is truly something extraordinary and definitely worth a visit. The cherry blossom trees were stunning.,,
,,Amazing,5,,"Awestruck, the most amazing garden we鈥檝e ever seen. A must for those travelling to Singapore. Take a few hours to take it all in.",,
,,a master peice of sicence and art !,5,,"very pleasant, a must see if you are in Singapore , how it is constructed is just proof of how architecture and science can actually create beauty !",,
,,Must see,5,,This is an absolute must see if you visit Singapore. You鈥檒l regret it for the rest of your life if you skip it :),,
,,Another must do.,5,,A real feat of engineering and yet more proof as to how right Singapore have got it. This place was just unreal. Please visit.,,
,,Overcrowded and disappointing,2,,"Compared to our first visit a few years ago, this time around we were disappointed especially with the flower dome where it was just teeming with tourists! Too much & too many! You couldnt enjoy the flowers anymore because people just kept pushing. I had high hopes for the Sakura blossoms but was grossly disappointed. Management should think about how to properly manage crowds.",,
,,Beautiful!!!!!,5,,This place is amazing - well worth a visit. Head down around 3pm so that you can view during the day and visit cloud forest etc then stay for the free night show - well worth it!!!!!!!!,,
,,Lovely way to spend the day,5,,I thoroughly enjoyed my visit. The plants were beautiful in the domes and the cloud dome with its high walkways and waterfall was amazing. I would recommend it to anyone visiting Singapore. If you don鈥檛 want to pay to go into the domes a visit to the super trees which is free is worthwhile. It is easily accessed from Bayfront MRT station.,,
,,Must-see!,5,,"This is without a doubt a must-see when in Singapore. And make sure you go there both in the morning and at night. You can also catch the light show from Marina Bay Sands Pool Deck just at the back of the bar. I hope we have something like this back at home. Oh btw, there鈥檚 drinking fountains everywhere, that was great. It really promotes sustainable living for the environment. Make sure you bring a reusable bottle if you go here. Every disposable water bottle counts.",,
,,Great to see both during the day and at night,5,,"The domes, amazing, the nighttime light show in the super tree grove, unforgettable. Definitely worth a visit.",,
,,Interesting sights of the garden city,5,,Get the tickets for both domes. You can spend the entire afternoon learning more about floral and fauna and how the rainforest ecosystem is like.,,
,,Sakura at garden by the bay,4,,"The greenhouse ambience was nice and cooling. Sakura was beautiful, everything was great except only for the large crowded crowds.",,
,,Amazing place,5,,Gardens by the bay is one of the must see attractions of Singapore. The flower dome n cloud dome can鈥檛 be missed . The flowers took my breath away n I was amazed to see how a reclaimed land has been converted into something which is a joy forever. One gets transported to a dreamy world. How can I not mention the amazing light n sound show in the evening ? It鈥檚 a must watch for all age groups. One should also try the OCBC skyway to get an aerial view of the bay area. The world should learn from Singaporeans ....,,
,,Fantastic,5,,"Spent a whole day here! Walking 鈥嶁檧锔?to every corner of the gardens enjoying the lakes and different gardens (all for free) then after lunch we did the skywalk and went to the two domes , which were fantastic, exciting and very beautiful. Well worth it. Next time we are in Singapore we will be back.",,
,,Absolutely beautiful,5,,This place is unbelievable. It is a must do in Singapore. Flowers and atmosphere is incredible. Everyone must visit,,
,,Sueprb,5,,"Should properly choose the pricing scheme they offer, e.g. they offer a shuttle service just to pick and drop at the center point of the garden which is walkable. They don't cover
the entire garden, for that one has to privately book. But it is a very nice place.",,
,,Mesmerising Mother Nature,4,,A great place to unwind among the lovely garden in Singapore. The environment is with air condition. But F&B is very expensive around the area.,,
,,Nice Experience,4,,Gardens by the Bay is one of the most visited attractions in Singapore. It is a nice place to go and you can spend the whole day there in the two domes and also in the spacious gardens outside.,,
,,Fabulous!,5,,"Gardens by the Bay was a wonderful attraction. Very pretty and tranqui. It got a bit busy and crowded in parts. Would highly recommend, especially if you needed something to do if it was raining.",,
,,Amazing place !!!!,5,,Flower dome & Cloud Forest were wonderful places to visit in our travel by Singapur :) The show in Great Tree is too beuatiful in front of Maryna Bay Sands,,
,,A beautiful park area from reclaimed land,5,,"We visited Gardens by the bay for the light show at 19:45 on our first night in Singapore.
After catching the bus from Orchard Road we walked across the bridge, which was planted with trees and other bushes, from the impressive Sands Hotel to the park.
After the show we wandered around and came across the Flower Dome and the Cloud Dome.
We purchased our tickets for Domes on the next day (not refundable), but if we had bought them on the actual day there is a refund policy.
Returning the next day both Domes were well worth the ticket price.
The Flower Dome was hosting a Sakura flower display and the cloud Dome is a permanent walk around a Cloud Forest which takes you up into the sky.
Then it was off for something to eat at Satay by the Bay and got there just in time to get under cover before the afternoon downpour.
A really enjoyable visit and so much better than visiting the modern casino resort on Sentosa.",,
,,As parks go this one is great,5,,"A really nice and informative park to visit.

Divided into different garden areas include some enclosed ones the educational parts of made interesting for children.

The walk in artificial trees is great and the spectacular indoor waterfall is good.

Plenty of eating outlets, toilets and places to get drinks.",,
,,environment,3,,mountain people during sakura season. cant take very well picture in flower dome. please add more sakura,,
,,Magical!,5,,I love how they change the theme in the Flower Dome depending on the season. I was there last Oct and they had pumpkins. This time it was the Sakura (cherry blossoms). Love it!,,
,,Heaven,5,,You feel you are not on this earth.... the beauty and creativity you will see are extraordinary. It should be the icon of Singapore.,,
,,Lovely,5,,Very beautiful though it can get very crowded on the weekends. Highly recommend to buy tickets online to skip the ticketing queue which can take up to 30mins on the weekends,,
,,Really Great,4,,"We really enjoyed walking around, some of the displays are incredible as well as being able to see the tall buildings of Singapore through amazing flower displays. Well worth spending time there especially the aerial displays.",,
,,In awe,4,,"Expect to walk heapsss! There are so many things to see and to take it all at a slow pace.

The gardens itself is free entry - it鈥檚 a large park with benches throughout.

Other access areas you鈥檒l need to pay for - they have an indoor waterfall, indoor greenhouse/forest. Amazing.

Also did the treetop walk. View was awesome! Defs to see when in Singapore.",,
,,A Lovely place to visit,5,,"We had a quick visit here on our 2 night stay, unfortunately the weather was against us so the elevated walkway was closed due to the storm that arrived. this didn't completely spoil our visit as the said storm arrived whilst in one of the domes which was enjoyable.
A visit here is highly recomended and if we get to return to Singapore will make another visit here",,
,,A Beautiful Architectural Delight,5,,Gardens By the Bay is worth visiting. Every evening light and sound show takes place wherein all the gigantic man made trees are lit up in lights while various world famous sound tracks are played in sync with the changing lights. It's almost half an hour show which certainly mesmerizes the audience for sure. This is sure a not to be missed attraction.,,
,,Beautiful,5,,Lot's to see here and you don't have to be a keen botanist to enjoy your time here. Allow your self plenty of time for strolling round. Something different around every corner.,,
,,Sakura Sakura Sakura,5,,The view at the Flower Dome was spectacular . You will be enchanted by the sight with traditional Japanese tunes playing in the background.,,
,,Love and responsibility for nature,5,,"A true masterpiece of technology that integrates nature and shows the way we should cherish and preserve it. I was really impressed by the theatre presenting a short movie about nature that is projected on all the walls, floor included. Must see",,
,,A beautiful part of the city,5,,"The gardens are beautiful and the Super Trees are really impressive, definitely go late afternoon so that you catch the trees in the evening. The sky walk gives great views of the skyline and over the gardens. The two conservatories - Flower Dome and Cloud Dome - are really nice and a cool break from the outside humidity. Definitely go to the flower dome first as it might be slightly disappointing following the cloud dome. Both are great but the cloud dome was incredible!",,
,,Sakura theme,4,,Daytime visit will be better because we could hardly see or admire the flowers in the dark during night time.,,
,,Too crowded,3,,"It's really too crowded, long long queue for every point. I am my old parents, can't stand and queue for so long. End up half way left. So sad to disappointed them.",,
,,After many visits I still love this place!,5,,"As an expat loving in Singapore I have made 14 visits to Gardens by the Bay and the Super Trees, Flower Dome and Cloud Forest with visitors that have come to Singapore and I still love this place.",,
,,Not much improvement since my last visit - more than 5 years ago.,3,,I was excited when my daughter presented both my hubby and i with two tickets - Flower Dome and Cloud forest. Flower Dome was great. But i was rather disappointed that Cloud forest had not changed much.,,
,,Must have seen,4,,"When in Singapore, you must visit this place. Both during day time and in the evening ! Spectacular views, impressive light shows at night.",,
,,Too crowded,1,,I went there with my girl to see cherry blossom.wss disappointed as not much to see n most of te flower are going to die. The way to food fair was not clear n I almost being knock by a wheel chair. The lady pushing wheel chair did not want to stop pushing even I'm in front of the wheel chair n in front of me was other people. I met her three times. Finally inside the food fair I lost control n scolded her. Ur securtiy didn't do a gd job on tis. There wasn't any special path for wheelchair to move. What make me frustrate was she almost roll the wheelchair over my girl feet. Imagine if it really happen. I thought this type of event should be well prepare for over crowded but it didn't.,,
,,Gbtb,4,,"Nice place, bought tickets online to just the flower dome. Pretty crowded at 9~10am on a bank holiday.",,
,,Flower Dome,4,,The flowers are beautiful especially with the Sakura theme. My son seems to enjoy himself very much.,,
,,Great experience,5,,Going there for the third time and I still feel happy and excited to see what kind flowers are there related to the theme . I have to say the flowers are so pretty and it feels like I'm in another country (depending on the theme). It great for friends and family outing.,,
,,The King of all Garden - more like a jungle,5,,Just wow. Need to make sure you stay for one of the two evening music shows that are free. Wow. Take a raincoat just in case.,,
,,GBTB,5,,"Good place to visit. Be it indoor or outdoor. There is place for kids to run around, there is place for old folks to sit and rest and there is place for couples.",,
,,Put the Eden Project to shame,5,,The first dome is outstanding and travels through the world with its planting schemes. The cloud dome is something else. You really are up in the clouds and the plants that grow there are stunning. You can buy a ticket to do the two.,,
,,Excellent displays of world flora,5,,"There is no charge to see the external gardens, but fees apply for the Domes & Skyway. Discounts are available for seniors, and if you show a Singapore Airlines boarding card. The gardens are easily accessed from the bayfront promenade through the Sands Marina Shopping Mall via the hotel pedestrian bridges.

The gardens are beautifully designed & maintained. Allow time to enjoy their full extent.

Time your visit early for cooler temperatures & fewer visitors, or evening for the light display.",,
,,Escape from the skyscrapers,5,,"The gardens are amazing. They are very large and well maintained and you could easily spend a day there. There are a number of different restaurants including an out door area with a range of local foods. The super trees are incredible and the high sky walk is unmissable, but the twin stars of the park are the two domes. Whereas the main park is free, there is an admission fee for the domes but they are absolutely incredible. Both are massive, one with an eternal spring display and the other with a massive waterfall and rainforest spectacular. Near to the underground, this is a must for a visitor to Singapore.",,
,,Great atmosphere,5,,"The gardens had a decent variety of flowers, many of which were in the perfect state for observing and photo taking. Being a Sunday, it was rather crowded with tourists from all around the world who kept touching the flowers. Would suggest to go on a weekday instead.",,
,,Sakura in Singapore 馃槏,4,,"I always wanted to go Japan or other countries to admire cherry blossom. At Gardens by the bay, there are many different types Sakura with different colours. There are beautiful. It was a good experience without having to travel far away.",,
,,A good place to visit,4,,"Very nice exhibits and adds values with the Japan Fair. The whole theme was well coordinated. The flowers were nice, crowd control was good.",,
,,Nice Experience,4,,"It needs time to see the place thoroughly but we had little time left so we were in hurry. The garden is well maintained, fully green in view. Lots of botanical species are here also like Botanical Garden.",,
,,High Light of the trip,5,,"Having visited Singapore several times we saw no reason to return other than to visit the Gardens. Enlightening and entertaining, in the day we did the grand tour including walking the internal sky way, the 'trees' look impressive but not remarkable. So we returned at night for the light show. Other than some boot up problems with the computer control the night show is excellent, truly worth seeing and listening to.",,
,,Sakura was beautiful and my old mother enjoy. However the customer service was not up to standard,4,,Instruction given by information Centre was not clear thus resulted in extra walking distance for my old mother.,,
,,Matsuri at flower Dome,5,,Great sakura matsuri bloom display at flower Dome. I enjoyed the variety of flowers displayed at Flower Dome. There鈥檚 also Japan fair and renting of kimono at the venue,,
,,Great place to go,5,,A place you shouldn鈥檛 miss in Singapore with your family. You will get to see most of the plant in one place.,,
,,beautiful garden,5,,"This garden is very big. There are lot of varieties of flowers , plant , vertical gardens etc...

Go early morning, even if you can manage before 9am it will be good. Afternoons could be pretty hot so be careful if you have children with you. Children may not enjoy a lot since there is lot of walking.

The cloud forest is too good. it is very cold inside.
The light show is superb. Could not visit flower dome due to time constraint but one must visit. The OCBC sky way could be expensive as it is only for 15 minutes but worth it.",,
,,Beautiful by the bay!!,5,,One of the best light show I seen. Well done guys... I would spread the word about this place to all my friends around the world.,,
,,Lovely visit,5,,"Really impressed with the gardens. We used the driverless transfer facilitie at $5 worth it to experience the innovation of a driverless car.
Awesome views, but sadly the Indo China Restaurant was disappointing.
We paid for drinks at the top and got a very cold welcome. Was surprising.
I guess thats because we didnt have anything to eat.

But everything else was amazing and the staff around the gardens made its a lovely visit.
thank you",,
,,Sakura Matsuri event at Garden by the bay,5,,great service info from visitor centre. Long queue so I bought my ticket online. Great visit for first timer. It was a 2nd visit. But 1st time attend sakura matsuri event. It still refreshing for me to visit flower dome. Preferably if can have some plant description for the waterfall plant on the bridge. Best visit is in the morning/early afternoon and evening. Re-entry after catch a meal to catch the glimpse of night view in the dome. Worth it overall. Tried to go solo however it is hard when is overcrowding at Sakura tree in late afternoon from 3pm Sunday.,,
,,Awesome,5,,Bought the combined tickets to Flower Dome and Cloud Garden. Flower dome was full of exotic flowers. Cloud garden has a feel of mystical wonders.,,
,,Wish there is more sakura,3,,"Hi, noticed that the sakura this year is not really in abundance. Wish there are more displays of sakura trees around flower dome.",,
,,Great!,5,,"Very nice place to visit. Singapore as expected a very clean and well organised place. Even though the queue is long but its a very pleasant trip. No one cut q, etc. Blossom flower is very pretty....",,
,,Sakura Festival,5,,We are very please to see such large quantities of Sakura everywhere ! Good variety and still very fresh ! Best of all was can rent kimono for this photo shoot !,,
,,review of Garden by the bay,5,,"clean and awesome experience. Like that the garden is indoor and even though is crowded, it is still very organized. Thanks for the sakura exhibition!",,
,,Sakura Matsuri 2018,3,,"Experiencing cheery blossoms in Flower dome was indeed eventful and exciting, with only crowd control the minus point of this experience.",,
,,Amazing,4,,OMG ... we loved it ... fabulous! So beautiful and such a lovely surprise when you don't know what to expect. Relaxing and able to be done at your own pace. It's air conditioned ... yay.,,
,,Breathtaking,4,,So glad we visited - even in pouring rain. The domes were full of every type of plantation and quite spectacular. The light show at the end of the evening is a must see. Clean cafes on site and an efficiently ru. Operation.,,
,,Interesting,4,,"It takes a few hours to see this well. Beautiful gardens from all over the world. The Japanese garden was particularly stunning with the cherry blossoms in bloom. The indoor waterfall and cloud walk in the Cloud some were worth seeing! The little bus around the gardens was informative. Bring a sweater, the gardens are cool. Plan for your way home. The taxi stand was crazy!!!!!!",,
,,Amazing,5,,"I loved Gardens by the Bay. The views are so beautiful. The walk was perfect, so many amazing photos/video shots you can take .
I didn鈥檛 try any cafes around however i was dying for coffee so i decided to walk in 鈥淐af茅 Crema鈥?I asked for a Soy Latte. and the person said that they didn鈥檛 have 鈥渟oy鈥?in a rude kind of way so i would never go back there. i walked away without ordering anything. I don鈥檛 appreciate been spoken to like that. Fair enough if you don鈥檛 have soy milk! But they don鈥檛 have to be so rude.
Anyways other then that everything was amazing... The lighted up trees, the marina bay sands was breath taking.

I wanted to try the Satay by the bay but seem like everything closed so early at 9pm so i rushed out after going to the japanese sakura display in the flower dome.

But yes i would definitely recommend this place for the locals or the tourists.

I took so many amazing photos! I will never forget this moment.",,
,,Impressive,5,,We started with the cloud forest which was veryyyy nice and we continue the whole garden.Every inch in it is nice especially at night.The colored lights gave her additional magic with lighting of the flyer and Marina bay sands.I recommand it.If you visit Singapore you must pass by Gardens by the bay.,,
,,Light show,4,,we only went to light show because we run out of time in Singapore good garden and location and you need minimum of half of day to visit full garden.superb light show at 7.45 PM,,
,,Morning walk,5,,"I enjoyed walking around the gardens, thankfully not too hot in the morning. So beautifully maintained and varied with many opportunities to stop for tea. Lovely way to spend a few hours on the morning.",,
,,What's Not to Like?,5,,"Double whammy pleasure to see the tribute to cherry blossoms... (and I've done Japan *just* for that). Well worth the visit, and the extra cost for inside the domes.",,
,,Great Gardens and Greenhouses - a must see!,5,,I love visiting `Gardens by the bay' it is a great place to get back to nature. The two greenhouses are well worth the admission price. The sky walk and light show are also a must see. I spent around 4 hours here and loved every minute.,,
,,"Pretty, Clean, Safe, Good crowd control",5,,"I revisited in March 2018 for Sakura (second visit to this place), I brought an elderly with me. It was very crowded, but glad they do great crowd control. It's just not those messy, no people cut queue or climb fence type of scenario, it was good manner crowd with staff everywhere to ""protect"" the flowers and help people with questions so I was glad.
Very refreshing flower smell, well maintain flowers, lots of varieties + good Japanese food so we spent 2-3 hours in Flowers Dome alone.",,
,,A must in Singapore,5,,"If you just here for a short stay, forget the shopping and see this spectacular garden. The two huge greenhouses do not even feel like an indoor attraction. To even be able to build the great waterfall that is in one of them is amazing. The 鈥滱vatar鈥?trees are sureal but still look so good with the living trees and plants, strong but yet delicate in their form.",,
,,Gardens with Hi-tech,5,,"Being a frequant traveller to Singapore for many years, this is the first time to visit Gardens By The Bay with my teenage boy. Being a world reknown travel and business hub in Asia, Singapore has successfully apply the high technology in every aspect of live. Not only high tech in Its Changi Airport (currently have 4 terminal) with green concept, but also to building amazing gardens in this metropolitan City. The Cloud Forest with Its 30 m high waterfall covered by carefully selected tropical plants, is amazing. Visit the Flowers Dome we are Lucky come during tge cherry blossom season. The Sakura Matsuri is so eyes catching. A dozen of different species of sakura blossom at the same time, become the main attraction in the garden. There are also a dozen species of orchids and many many, so many flowers. All the plants live under a controlled temperature, with recycling concept. Its amazing to see How the Hi-tech make possible the growth of any kind of plant avalable on earth . I feel Lucky this time to visit the garden when tge sakura blossom.",,
,,Beautiful plants and flowers,5,,"Bring tour camera (phone). Lots of beautiful flowers. Always something in blossom. With some variations during the year like tulips in the spring, Christmas, CNY. Try to avoid rush hours like weekends. The waterfall area may be humid.",,
,,Beautiful!,5,,"This is just as amazing as you want it to be. You can pay to go inside the domes or up the sky trees or both, but if money is an issue, there鈥檚 quite a bit you can see outside. It鈥檚 also fairly easy to get to via metro. Satay outdoor food court right in the area. You just can鈥檛 go wrong. It鈥檚 magical.",,
,,Stunning - a must do,5,,Simply amazing. A must do if you are in Singapore. Visited both cloud forest and dome. Plenty of walks but worth an effort.,,
,,Too huge,5,,This was an amazing garden and very huge.. We hardly covered half of it since we were very tired.. So if you're planning to visit there then ensure that you travel with cycle in the bay and visit late in the afternoon so that you can view the lighting in the garden,,
,,A must to see,5,,"Just go, first in the daytime, and then again at night. The best free show you may ever see. The area around is full of things to see and the Marina Bay Sands Hotel is a must to visit. Go inside and then use the walkway to the gardens. Breathtaking.",,
,,Mandatory viair,5,,Be there when the light show is. Around 19:45. Free entrance. Only cost is if you want to walk the bridge between the trees. That is 8 sgd.,,
,,Simply Stunning!,5,,"We visited GBTB just before Easter, the gardens are stunning, the variety of plants and flowers is amazing and the hidden sculptures are so beautifully made. We were lucky enough to get to see the cherry blossom display, wow! Great day out.
Next time I will take a jacket or wrap, climate control for the plants meant it was very very cold.",,
,,Passes the time in a lack lustre Singapore.,2,,Plenty of walking. Good place to get some fresh air and exercise away from the air conditioning and restuarants.,,
,,Excellent day out,5,,This was a beautiful place to visit. The main gardens are free so you can more than once - there are plenty of areas for the kids to play including a water area. The indoor domes are well worth a visit and are air conditioned. You need a ticket for these but it is all self explanatory.,,
,,Worth a vidit,4,,"You can whip round fairly quickly if you can avoid the Chinese tourists who photograph everything and in particular themselves at every opportunity. The cloud dome is the better of the two.

The outdoor aerial walkway is also worth doing and is paid for separately. Easy to nip over to Marina Bay afterwards.",,
,,Cloud forest was amazing,5,,Loved the cloud forest and although i am petrified of heights i did walk out on the walkways as the stunning floral display keeps your mind off of the fact you are metres above the ground.,,
,,Transforming the City in a Garden,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is a nature park spanning 101 hectares (250 acres) of reclaimed land[2] in central Singapore, adjacent to the Marina Reservoir. The major attractions are Super Tree Grove, Cloud Forest, Flower Dome and beautifully designed green space with plants and foliage. The entire area exudes technological respect for green environment and hope for a great future of human civilisation. Energy efficiency and conservation of natural resources are highlights of this peaceful surrounding. While the huge tall structural figures of Supertrees, large mountainous looks of Cloud Forest and Flower Dome make one awestruck by the sizes, the beautiful foliage and wide variety of flowers of different continents including miniature orchids add to the amazement. These gardens by the bay have made Singapore a city in a garden.",,
,,A must visit!,5,,We had this on our bucket list in Singapore as only staying for a couple of days and it was amazing! We visited in the evening and saw the light show - as it鈥檚 free admission it鈥檚 a must! We paid a small admission to go into the Cloud Forest which was also a really good experience.,,
,,Atrocious crowd control,2,,"The poor rating is mostly related to absolutely atrocious crowd control, bordering on a safety hazard for guests and staff. The Cloud Forest was manageable, however the Flower Dome was so packed, it was unpleasant to say the least. There was no clear route guides to steer guests in the a general direction with resultant pandemonium. Some parts risked a stampede, it was that crowded!

To be fair, the exhibits and domes are beautiful, though not much of the flower dome could be enjoyed.",,
,,Must visit,5,,Next to Marina bay Sands resort has its own mrt stop..ideally buy a 3 $ ticket for a tram ride at the entry to and fro to domes( cloud forest and flower dome) if need to avoid walking . Free entry except for the domes.. ideally should start at around 3 pm visit the domes and end at the Main tree grove for the light and sound show which starts after 7 pm..top 20 places in the world for favourite check ins..A must for relaxing views walks feel... Best place for Singapore sight seeing..,,
,,Interesting and beautiful,5,,"I was lucky to be in Singapore during the Sakura flower display. The two domes are definitely worth visiting. Lots to take in and admire. Security however, has to tightened. I witnessed many tourists touching the flowers despite warning signs against such behaviour.",,
,,Beautifully maintained gardens (Flower Dome and Cloud Forest),4,,The place was busy with both tourist and locals. Both the flower dome and cloud forest were beautifully maintained. It is obvious that lots of care and maintenance have been done in this place as we can see staff working in the gardens as well. Its a great place to cool down from the tropical heat. Definitely one of the better places of interest in Singapore.,,
,,A cool place to get away from the hot Singapore weather,4,,"After walking through the Singapore heat to get to the 2 conservatories (Flower Dome and Cloud Forest), getting inside will be a cold welcome for tired travellers. :) The flower dome has a sakura exhibit when we visited. The cloud forest has a man-made waterfall that is crowded with tourists trying to take a picture.",,
,,Amazing!,5,,"What a wonderful experience this is! So much to look at! The cooling observatories are also a welcome when in the heat of Singapore! The displays are amazing! It鈥檚 also well worth a look at night, spectacular!",,
,,Fantastic,5,,"Loved the gardens, really well kept and lovely place to walk through. Visited multiple times on our trip because it was so close to the centre of town. Went for the light show in the evening which was amazing (although the first time we tried they had cancelled the show for Earth Hour and rather helpfully not told the large crowd waiting there... We only found out when we waited for half an hour and then checked their website)",,
,,Oasis in the City,4,,"You could spend a lot of time here and see something different every time. We paid to visit the flower show. It was SO crowded inside so it was a little difficult to see the garden and manage small kids at the same time. I wouldn鈥檛 necessarily recommend bringing in little kids.
But within the park there is a children鈥檚 water play area which is fabulous. Make sure to bring spare clothes.
Don鈥檛 miss Satay by the Bay - the hawker food market is fantastic! Great value and the locals love it.",,
,,Great place,4,,Don't miss it when you visit Singapore... Children will love this place... One of it's kind... Just loved it...,,
,,Amazing,4,,Just an amazing place Must see to appreciate this wonder! Queues weren鈥檛 too long and staff were happy to help. Amazing surroundings!,,
,,Highlight of my trip!,5,,Visiting Gardens by the Bay was a highlight of my trip. I highly recommend going at night in time for the light show at .45mins pas the hour from 7pm. It Was absolutely spectacular and just delightful.,,
,,An amazing park!!,5,,"Everyone visiting Singapore must at least visit the park once. It is something that you haven鈥檛 seen before! So many different gardens, a variety of plants, the worlds largest inside waterfall, all the little details so carefully placed, and so much more!! It鈥檚 an amazing experience and despite the pricey ticket, it鈥檚 one of the best sightseeings in the whole world!",,
,,Beautiful!!,5,,"We took the hop-in hop-off bus which dropped us right in front of Gardens by the bay.. The garden if free except for the domes. We bought our ticket through weekend-go-where Singapore, so got to the see the domes, which have distinct flowers and features. very beautiful and great for pictures. There is a tram for which you have to pay 3$SNG extra/person which will give you a tour around the entire park.. worth it, if there is lack of time. The super trees are a sight to see especially in the night, so try to may it in the evening so you can see the lights and get back. stroller friendly and few cafes within although we didnt stay for food.",,
,,Very beautiful and based on high technology,5,,"It is a place where you will see the nature love of Singapore mixed with high technology in the form of two air conditioned dome having various flora and fauna, rain forest and man made water fall.",,
,,Sakura Matsuri,4,,Spring is finally here with cherry blossoms galore. Pink red white flowers in abundance for two weeks. Loved the theme and can't wait for tulip season next!,,
,,Flower dome and cloud garden,5,,"Highlight of Singapore visit (besides the food!), probably because these domes are so cool...literally and figuratively speaking. A good way to get out of the heat. Very nice set up, unique in nature and quite colorful. A bit Disneyesque with a mix of traditional landscape and plants mixed with man-made setting.

Wish we had more time to tour, but we also had to get ready for the evening show at 7.40 pm. That was also a spectacle, well worth it.",,
,,Cloud forest 馃憣,5,,"Gardens by the bay is a very big area.we can take a tram ride of 5s$ which can take you to main attractions.the two main attractions are flower dome which is a dome that contains different types of flowers from different countries.Cloud forest has waterfall.we have to go by lift to the last floor and then there is a beautiful walkway to down.At 7:45 pm and 8:45pm
there is a laser show on super tree grove it is a must watch",,
,,Amazing,5,,Wonderful place to see and visit. Its nice to walk around and enjoy the different surroundings. Bring plenty of water because it鈥檚 a huge area with limited drinking stops.,,
,,Amazing place in the world,5,,"Singapore is must visit place in the world, especially Marina bay!! Such a beautiful Merlin statue, light shows over there, bay sands infra, especially casino.. wow! Stunning. You have time, try to be there for a while..",,
,,Impressive garden complex,5,,"Impressive garden complex featuring the Flower Dome, Cloud Forest and Supertree Grove. Spent an afternoon here followed by dinner at the nearby Satay by the Bay and then the sound and light show.",,
,,Amazing,5,,"This place is absolutely amazing with gardens from all over the world represented , the temperature inside was just right, don't miss this one",,
,,Went on tour,4,,"Nice 10 min show of lights. Very long queue to enter the ""trees"". Since I was with a tour I couldn't go up.",,
,,Blossom time,5,,"Although Easter holiday time and the gardens were very busy, they were still very beautiful. The light show is fabulous. The blossom display gorgeous, wish I lived closer so could visit more often",,
,,Beautiful spot to visit,5,,Lovely well maintained gardens and spectacular sights to see. Beautiful by day and night. Well worth the visit. The domes are a must to explore. So beauty and care has been taken to make this spectacular place,,
,,Awesome,5,,Something you just can鈥檛 miss. We paid for the flower domes and the skywalk. It was so worth the money. You have 15 minutes on the skywalk but could spend the rest of the day just strolling around taking in the beauty.,,
,,An Amazing Experience,5,,These gardens are quite amazing. It is easy to get there by taking the SMRT and then there is a shuttle for $3.00 at the station to take you to the gardens. It is quite cold in the gardens so a jacket would be advised. Allow around 2 hours to see them. They are extremely well done.,,
,,Exceeded all expectations,5,,"Visiting Gardens by the Bay and the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome was at the top of list of 'things to do' in Singapore and they exceeded all expectations (I'll do a separate review of the Supertree Grove). The outdoor gardens are really expansive and you just don't know where to go first - gardens, lakes, sculptures are all beautiful and well maintained. We meandered through the gardens and came to the domes - we first went in to the Cloud Forest which is huge. As you go through the doors you are greeted by the sight of an indoor 'mountain' with a magnificent, high waterfall and the pathway directs you along a route around the dome and climbs up through various levels - at one point you are looking out from the inside of the mountain and through the waterfall. They have got the most amazing collection of plants in this dome and it is a great combination of plants and architecture/engineering to keep even visitors with little knowledge of plants interested. We were in the Cloud Forest fairly early in the day so it wasn't too busy but by the time that we got in to the Flower Dome this was jam-packed (literally shoulder to shoulder) and was less enjoyable. There are lots of beautiful flowers in this dome but it did look contrived in comparison to the Cloud Forest. We had a good, and inexpensive, lunch at Satay by the Bay. These gardens are a must see - highly recommended to all.Top tip (for either dome): get there early - look at the outdoor gardens after you have been in the domes.",,
,,Even better with themes,5,,"My second time here, still enjoy this place but im not buying the souvenirs lol! This time i used mrt and shutte then relax in the park for a while! This place is so enjoyable! U also can get good angle for picturing MBS.",,
,,Amazing play ground,5,,"Everything is good and friendly here. Good food, good drinks and gifts. Must enjoy here when you鈥檙e in SG.",,
,,Flower Garden Dome attraction,5,,"This year Flower Dome has attracted more tourists and attractions due to Sakura decorations, anime events and other Japanese activities.",,
,,"Must visit, even on a short stopover",5,,"One of our favourite things we did in Singapore was visiting the Gardens by the Bay. There鈥檚 so much variety across the two domes that we easily spent an hour in each, not to mention the Supertree grove. We didn鈥檛 go up the Skywalk as we felt the best way to view that area was at night for the light show, which was brilliant and also definitely a must do 鈥?though expect ridiculous crowds, as you are bottlenecked getting in and out (particularly bad getting out if you go to the first showing as you meet crowds coming in for the next one). For the flower domes, it鈥檚 worth booking your tickets online in advance (available up to a month before) not due to any cost saving but it allows you to print them off and walk straight in avoiding any queues at the ticket office. The only thing that surprised us was how cold the tropical dome felt despite us expecting it to be tropically hot! Even if you only have a day or so stopping over in Singapore, I would prioritise this among things to do, both for the domes in the day and the supertree light show in the evening.",,
,,For flower lovers,4,,"The gardens had 2 conservatories. Best time to visit is when its not raining. You need to alot atleast half a day for both cobservatories unless you wont take pictures while inside.

There are a lot of picturesque flowers inside as well as the tree with falls.",,
,,Extraordinary site,5,,Amazing to view the different trees lighted & change lights on the music show played for all the tourists,,
,,Was ok,3,,Gardens by the bay is ok...isn鈥檛 worth raving about like every man and his dog does. Some unique flowers however can get very crowded. We were very pissed off when we bought a bottle of water at the shop to take with us walking around and you couldn鈥檛 take it in. We had to scull it. Very stupid rules. Ticketing system through travel agents for these tickets are an absolute nightmare so don鈥檛 buy through your travel agent- buy when you get to the door. We won鈥檛 be back- been there done that,,
,,"Beautiful, Beautiful, Beautiful",5,,"The best day of our holiday to Singapore was spent here. The gardens are just beautiful. The whole site is worth the visit and go back after dark for the light show which is stunning.

Access to the gardens is free, but you need to pay to go in the Cloud Forest and on the Sky Walk. Remember to present your Singapore Airlines boarding pass for discounts!",,
,,Excellent and must visit place,5,,"This place is amazing. Must visit for flower lovers. Offers variety of flowers on display. Also the place has a light show which starts at 7.45 pm. Make sure u reach on time for getting the best place to seat. Its always over crowded.
Best place to visit in singapore",,
,,Gardens,4,,The first thing you need to do is make sure you take something for cooler climate as the cloud garden is cool. The gardens are lovely and we were lucky to be there to see the cherry blossom. Allow half a day.,,
,,A spectaculare place to be in the evening.,4,,We where there to see the lights on the trees in evening. A must to do being in Singapore. You do not ned to pay to see.,,
,,Wished I Had Green Fingers,5,,Spectacular! Go late afternoon early evening so you get to enjoy the gardens by day and the night lights. To enjoy an elevated view go towards the MTR platform or walkway towards Marina Bay Sands.,,
,,Just amazing,5,,"We had a couple of days stopover in Singapore when flying home from Australia and spent much of that time in the Gardens. The domes, the trees, just wandering around the gardens and then of course their is the fantastic light show in the evenings. I could easily go back there and do it all again, highly recommended.",,
,,Beautiful Gardens.,5,,"Beautiful place, make sure to stay for the light show, lay in the grass and look up for the best view. Paying the small fee to go up on the walkway in the top of the trees was worth it for the view.",,
,,Delightful garden!,4,,"This is a very different and delightful garden that is as good, if not better, for children, as well as adults. Even though the Cloud Forest or Sakura/Flower Exhibit had a cost, it was well worth the price. I chose to do a membership, more costly, but I wanted to support what this garden is doing regarding the environment. Maybe I will be able to go back before I leave. Please do go and be as excited and surprised as I was at the combination of art, garden and technology that is there. Plus there are wonderful views to be had from both domes...high up or down low.",,
,,Air-conditioned domes,5,,As pretty much all of the other reviews of stated Gardens by the bay is fabulous. We were there for about 6 hours and enjoyed the entire experience. The two domes are air conditions which is a nice break from the Heat. We paid $28 through booking.com to do both domes as well as the Skywalk. Booked on their own it would have been $36.. If you just want to wander The Gardens and not see the dorms or do the Skywalk there is no cost. There is a food court on site and prices were reasonable.,,
,,Garden by the bay,5,,Went here after the sun went down. Many light and music. The weather was fresh and chilli. Enjoy a lots to be there.,,
,,really impressive,4,,"We visited on Good Friday so it was packes, but typical Singaporian efficiency and love of a queue meant that the queues were not too long - 30 mins to buy a ticket and 10 mins to get into each dome.

The domes are amazing with lota to see, although, a 20 mins queue to get to tge lift for the cloud dome (just sheer volume).

Lots of information aigns explaining what you are looking at and each dome is very different, with the cloud dome focusing on water recyling and the flower dome on different climates.

coat ia $28 for adults and $18 for kids under 12.

Had dinner at Sate by the Bay, a hawker market.....kids loved walking around choosing food. prices ok, not more expensive thab usual.

We also saw the light show under the mega treea (nightly at 7.45 and 8.45) . it lasts 15 mins and is well worth hanging around for.",,
,,Awesome treat with family!,5,,"If you love gardens, this is the place to visit when in Singapore. Make sure you set aside a whole day ...until dusk to enjoy the lights, too. Take lots of photos because you may not want to forget the best details. Check out the amazing nature-themed sculpture blended with the plants and flowers. They have a good collection or orchids and many rare plants..Could get really crowded on vacation days and weekends. Bring a water bottle, specially in this tropical and humid weather, and an energy bar, you will do a lot of walking and waiting during the queue. They have gift shops for souvenirs and food stalls. A ride is provided from the gate to the featured exhibits located in two grandeous domes.",,
,,Incredible,5,,Wonderful place ..like another planet ...certainly worth a day visit and go back at night for the light show...,,
,,Don't miss the Gardens by the Bay,5,,"There is no way one should go to Singapore without seeing this. It's beyond lovely! A million thumbs! My only regret is not going back for an evening viewing. Fortunately we were able to see the evening lights from our hotel, The Ritz Carlton.",,
,,A must see when in Singapore,4,,"What an experience, my third visit and every visit is a pleasure. Even if you are not a lover of flora and fauna you will love this place. From the water fall to the beautifully preserved gardens, exotic plants and seasonally themed arrangements are a pleasure to see. The sunset is a good time to be there as those magnificent lights come to life. Great family or couples day out. Had a tour with business colleagues and all thoroughly enjoyed. Recommend as the No. one spot to visit in Singapore",,
,,Fabulous,5,,So we'll done. Even when crowded lots to do and ways to avoid the crowd. Played photo bomb. Worst thing ever the mobile phone and the selfie stick. Only did the 2 domes. Hubby not happy with heights. Cloud dome does go up a bit but not a worry. Spectacular displays. Went on a public holiday and didn't feel it was overcrowded. Value for money and a must if you are here,,
,,flowers flowers flowers everywhere,5,,"What0all can you ask from a garden?
If you are wondering, let me tell.
Please book a full day for this.
3 out of all attractions here are chargeable.
Flower Dome and Skyway are definitely worth it.
Cloud forest is subjective.
I enjoyed every minute there.",,
,,Awesome,5,,"The 2 domes were awesome. Sakura flower is really beautiful. And the man made waterfalls is really unbelievable because of the plants. 5 stars because of a lot of walk but Good thing there, there is a lift and escalator inside. And fully air condition",,
,,Beautiful day,5,,"Spent several hours visiting gardens which are gorgeous and have some amazing pieces of sculpture,just keeps getting better as this was our second visit in five years",,
,,amazing!!!,5,,"Wonderful experience to see the beauty of nature. The Cloud Forest with amazing Waterfall.The flower Dome which we luckily see the sakura.Also different flowers, trees ,cactus , and orchids of course.Beautiful! The supertree grove which is free entrance unless you want to see the view on top . I suggest to do it before sunset or few minutes before the light show.It is very worth it to do it.",,
,,A Must Visit Place in Singapore,4,,A very well managed and nice place to visit for locals and visitors. Enjoyed the light show very much and took many photographs and videos during our visit. Will come back to Gardens by the Bay if we were to visit Singapore again.,,
,,A must see.,5,,"Singapore is a modern place, this is well known. But this place makes you forget you're in a densely populated urban environment. You could easily be somewhere else entirely. The displays are awesome. It brings a sense of peace and the evening light and sound show is something to behold.

So glad I made time to see this.",,
,,Such a fun place to wander around,5,,We spent almost a whole day here - wandering the gardens and seeing the sculptures. We visited the Flower and Cloud Domes which were wonderful.,,
,,"Incredible, absolute must do",5,,Definitely go here! It鈥檚 free to look around the super trees but would recommend paying To walk the sky walk. The bar on top of the tallest super tree provided a good view but was extortionately priced so wouldn鈥檛 recommend. The cloud forest is also extra but we spent an hour in there and would definitely recommend a visit.,,
,,Absolutely Amazing,5,,"Several people told us this was the #1 place to visit during our stay. Amazing is the only world. I think we took over a 100 photos so we could add them to our memory book. Allow yourself at least 2 - 3 hours and preferrably go later in the afternoon. When they light up the displays as it gets dark, they are just beautiful.",,
,,Garden Heaven,5,,"Absolutely must visit whether your into gardening or not. Singapore is all about man made wonder and this is like a Central Park in the future world all clean and in a Dome. Worth a visit but once is enough, this bucket list is 鉁?
,,Nice well maintained attraction,5.0,,Lots to walk "," nature beauty...good place for nature lovers... Flowers from.different parts of the world in flower dome..and cloud some has attractive water falls .. Overall the place take about 2 hrs min to visit all the gardens""",
,,Awesome!!!,5,,"This place was amazing. There are so many stuffs to see. The flower dome the evening light show, the fountain etc.",,
,,Worth a visit,5,,The domes were breath taking. Should definitely visit if you have the time. Best ways to view is by walking. Takes about an hour to view both domes,,
,,Fantastic place,5,,Never go to Singapore without seeing The Gardens by the bay they are just beautiful. Make sure you go at night and see the light show it is just magnificent,,
,,Beautiful,5,,Loved the way nature was given priority at this place. Truly enforces Singapore's image as a Garden City. Truly worth the experience,,
,,Amazing,5,,"A must see whilst you鈥檙e in Singapore! So magical at night time to see the light show. Very clean and the actual work they鈥檙e doing is amazing, renewable energy and it鈥檚 very interesting to learn.",,
,,Spectacular Gardens,5,,"This is a must see attraction for the flower lovers. This our first trip to the Gardens by the Bay and we loved it. There are so many different flower and plant varieties from all over the world. The dome is set at a certain temperature, nice and cool. Lovely place to take plenty of photos. I would definitely recommend this attraction to family and friends.",,
,,Day visit,5,,Wow this place was just wonderful a must visit place when in Singapore. the gardens were stunning every turn was something different lovely walkways huge variety of different plants flowers trees shrubs a great day out. taxis from your hotel is very cheap so no excuse make sure bring plenty of water very humid and hot,,
,,"Highlight of our trip to Singapore. Many parts are free, but pay extra for total package.",5,,This area was perfect for getting to know a landmark in Singapore. We bought the ticket to do 3 extra events and it was well worth it. We got great photos. We stayed through the night to get the 8pm show experience. Highlight.,,
,,Must visit in Singapore - Fantastic!,5,,Wonderful place to enjoy nature. If you are a person who loves plants and green environments this is a place for you. The views from the Supertree grove are impressive!,,
,,Visit to Gardens by the Bay,5,,"During a recent visit to Singapore with a group of doctors,to attend an International Congress we had gone to Gardens of the Bay. It鈥檚 the most beautiful garden I have ever seen sprawling over acres of land. I would suggest everyone visiting Singapore to definitely see this place.",,
,,Great botanic garden,5,,"Great botanical exhibition. Walkthrough with a lot of interesting flowers, tries and tropical environment great for the hole family",,
,,Blew my mind,5,,"Had no expectations on what we鈥檇 see here, wonderfully surprised! Loved both the flower & cloud dome (visited both twice, not just because they鈥檙e air conditioned LOL), the flowers and garden designs are out of this world. Super tree walk was fabulous and easy to navigate with a pram - great view of marina bay sands. Next time we will visit the kids gardens & water park!",,
,,It was ok,4,,Busy/crowded and not too exciting for my 15 and 9 year olds. But the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest were pretty. And also air conditioned. Thought it was a bit over priced but good to see once.,,
,,Solo visit to Gardens by the bay,5,,This is definitely worth a visit. You go to Bayfront station in the metro then walk to the shuttle - follow the signs. The shuttle costs $3 and will take you to the entrance- which is very convenient if you have trouble walking or it is raining or boiling hot. The Cloud garden was very impressive and beautiful. The Flower garden had a Sakura Matsuri display which I especially enjoyed. It was very crowded so difficult to take decent photos!,,
,,A must to see.,5,,"Really nice and unique .We were there a few days a go. We all had a great time there.
You can experience a really different weather especially in Cloud Forest whivh is different from the weather outside.. as well as beautiful flowers and a really huge waterfall..
I am sure you will enjoy yourself there.",,
,,Must watch Attraction.. The Flower Dome and The Cloud Forest,5,,"Best to visit in second half as you can catch up the Light and sound show in the super tree groove starts at 7.45pm and 8.45 pm..

You need at least 4 to 5 hours to enjoy all of it. Its near to the Marina Bay Sands hotel. As Singapore Flier is ont operational currently, Looking at Singapore from top of is is worth.",,
,,A place to visit if you like greenery,4,,"If you like greenery, this is one place you must visit in Singapore. It has various types of flowers, plants and trees. The garden is also regulated with cool temperature so it is a nice place to to go if you find the heat in Singapore unbearable.",,
,,Attractions,4,,"This place is a garden, but with attractions that you might need to pay to go. I didn't spent a single cent as i think the outside is more than enough. During night, there's light show at 7.45pm and 8.45pm. Please do go and hs e a look at it.a very nice place for a walk especially if you are nearby.",,
,,Lots to see,5,,"We have visited Gardens by the bay before, each time we visit we find something different. Enjoyable day out lots of photographs taken",,
,,An innovative green gesture,4,,"It is a must visit in Singapore. The arrangement of gardens with its variety like, Chinese Garden, Japanese Garden etc. with suitable decorative features like, pagodas, rikshaw,etc are commendable. The air-conditioned interior comforts the tourist in visiting the garden and spending adequate time.",,
,,Worth it,5,,"Beautiful foliage, got to have good shoes and water, gets humid , so hydration is important, feel you are in a tropical jungle",,
,,Worth visiting in Singapore,5,,"Be here before 7:45 pm (Singapore time) each night to enjoy the light show, it a spectacle to behold.",,
,,Cherry blossoms!,5,,The garden has four enclosures and you can choose to go to as many as you want. There are different flowers for different seasons and this was the time for cherry blossoms! Though one has to walk a bit but it is a beautiful experience. The garden is beautifully done and a perfect place to click lots of pictures,,
,,Amazing,4,,We visited late one evening so were a little rushed but I am so pleased we did. It is a little pricey but well worth the money. This is an amazing array of flora in so many perfect habitats. The two domes are out of this world and the sights to be seen are not to be missed. Outstanding.,,
,,Must see!,5,,"Great place to visit,so much to see,,we saw the night show then went back in the daylight as we couldn't see it all in the dark.Nightly light shows at 7.45 and 8.45",,
,,Light show amazinf,5,,"They do a free light/sound show twice a night at 7.45 and 8.45 - this is spectacular and a must see - plus it鈥檚 free so why not!!
As we were staying in the marina bay we watched the first one from the rooftop but it鈥檚 best if you go down and experience it.",,
,,"A great walk in the ""sky""",5,,"Very good park, lots to do couple of hours. Don't miss Rainforest Dome and Flpwer Dome. At night, just walk around Marina Bay and the towers, and watch the amaizing show of lights and music. Enjoy!",,
,,Sakura Season,4,,Went during the sakura season at flower dome. beautiful but too crowded and place is slightly small.,,
,,Great visit,5,,"We done a night tour of gardens by the bay and we loved it the light show was exceptional. Very well done, perfect location for photography enthusiasts",,
,,"Gardens By The Bay, Singapore",5,,"A wonderful place to walk around and enjoy. It's a large area and the walking is very easy with wide concrete paths, which make it very accessible for wheelchairs and those who can't walk over uneven ground. The Gardens By The Bay are well laid out and at night the giant trees in Super Tree Grove are beautifully lit up. This creates a magical atmosphere and the views of these giant trees with the Singapore skyline behind is truly worth seeing. The triple towers of the iconic Marina Bay Sands Hotel create a spectacular backdrop. If you are in Singapore at night you absolutely must take a walk through these gardens. If you have time then also take the elevator up to the top of the huge big tree and enjoy a drink and the views from the bar at the top.",,
,,Bluerod17,5,,A great experience at night with the free light show Finished the evening with street food at Satay on The Bay Tasty and inexpensive Highly recommended,,
,,Amazing place,5,,One of the most beautiful places I've ever visited. There are many places to see in the garden and you can explore it for hours. You must visit the tree show in the evenings. Take into consideration that most of the attractions in the garden require entry fees which you better buy beforehand to avoid waiting.,,
,,Great natural history museum,5,,A very hands on experience for kids and adults to learn about the natural heritage of Singapore. Plan a full day to see everything and stick around for the tree Grove light show!,,
,,Magical light show,5,,You can walk thru to the gardens from the marina bay sands hotel. Stunning gardens with plenty to see. On my visit there was musical entertainment as well . There are different gardens to visit two are in domes one housing a rain forest effect waterfall. Worth staying on into the evening to see the light show which was quite magical and amazing especially if you have children.,,
,,Great place to spend a few hours,5,,"Plenty to see and do here, the highlight for me was the light and sound show in the artificial forest that takes place twice a night.",,
,,Great walk,5,,Lovely to enjoy this beautiful park land nestling alongside the city Could take bikes there which would be fine We鈥檒l worth doing the Sky walk,,
,,Gardens by the bay.,5,,"These gardens are worth a visit as seeing is believing. If possible go in the evening as they're having lights and sounds show. Those who don't get scared of height can do Sky walk, which is amazing.",,
,,Beautiful and lush,5,,Gardens are free but the indoor Cloud Forest and Flower Dome are not. Enjoyed them all. Worth an hour and the walk from marina area. Easy to get to by mass transit.,,
,,Well worth a visit,5,,We found this very easy to get to and also amazing how it was all set up inside and the information given per plant per country was exceptional One of the best attractions close second behind universal studios,,
,,Amazing,5,,Well worth a visit. We went in late pm so we could see both the gardens and the lights. The cloud garden was spectacular and we enjoyed the whole experience. While waiting for it to get dark we went to Satay on the Bay for a meal- lovely spot and plenty of choice plus well covered to keep us dry.,,
,,The free evening sound and light show is spectacular.,5,,"My wife and I visited the Gardens in late March 2018. The evening sound and light show is absolutely spectacular and is a Singapore must-do, and it's free.",,
,,Magical,5,,"Very interesting any to spend a couple of hours wh8le visiting the harbour area. There are two domes to look in, one has a tropical rainforest to it with an amazing high indoor waterfall. You gradually make your way up to the top of the domes that give stunning views. Lots of tropical plants to see which would be of great interest to green fingered visitors.",,
,,Cooling Place to go if You鈥檙e a Succulent Fan,3,,"There are several gardens/parks in this area and if you鈥檙e a first-timer, it鈥檚 not always easy to determine what it is you want to see. Fortunately there are emplyoees in the lines to the ticket counters who can help you determine if you are indeed in the correct line.

We appreciated this covered park mostly because of its relatively cool temperature; it also has a great selection of succulents. The designs are a bit kitschy but are probably a big hit with kids, who would enjoy a stay of about half an hour.",,
,,Lovely distination on our walk,5,,These beautiful gardens and the nightly light show were a wonderful destination following a long flight into the city.,,
,,Day in the park,5,,These gardens are definitely worth a visit plenty of walking but no steep hills you can reach the gardens by local bus or if you have a pass for the hop on hop off bus it stops just outside,,
,,Amazing Supertrees,5,,"We wanted to see the artificial trees up close and they did not disappoint. What a clever idea! The view of the gardens and over the city is well worth the entrance fee to the Skywalk linking two or three of the trees. The gardens are magnificent and are free! No need to pay to go inside the domes when there is so much to discover outside. Lush greenery and wonderful flowers, lakes, fountains and magical pathways. A relaxing place to wander and many places to sit and contemplate the vegetation without encountering too many people if you keep away from the Domes.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay.... never ceases to amaze!,5,,"Went to Gardens by the Bay with my extended family ---- including my sister, mom and aunt who came from overseas. Everyone was amazed and found it stunningly beautiful. It always has been that way since it opened.",,
,,Amazing gardens,5,,"So colourful , beautiful condition of flowers ,pleasure to see even if your not garden minded ,immaculate",,
,,Interesting display,5,,Enjoyable trip to the gardens. Great atmosphere. Interesting display. Would be better if there were cosplay performers.,,
,,Educational and relaxing!,5,,"We bicycled from the East Coast along the path all the way into Gardens by the Bay. The gardens are huge and one should try to spend at least 4-6 hours there to truly appreciate the work that has gone into this. Go on the walks and into the Clouds. It is affordable and very educational. Take your children and elderly too. There are lots of air-conditioned areas, good food and places to sit. You can also walk over to Marina Bay Sands as well. Accessible by Habour front MRT and/or taxi. Great place for a picnic, or just to stroll around and appreciate the gorgeous gardens. Young kids have a water play area too, so take their swimmers and a change along. Add this to part of your Singapore visit 'things to do' list.",,
,,Highlight of my trip,5,,Gardens by the bay is more beautiful than any picture can portray. It truly was a highlight of my trip to Singapore. Don't miss the Cloud Forest- definitely worth the money to visit.,,
,,Sakura Matsuri,5,,A great alternative for those who are unable to make it to japan and site was very well maintained :),,
,,indifferent,4,,The place was amazing but I don't know why I wasn't that impressed. Lol. Yeah it's nice how they could take care of all the plants and all but idk. I love nature but mehh.,,
,,Beautful place,5,,"Spent a couple of hours each day strolling round the gardens. The domes are well worth a visit especially the Cloud Forest with it's amazing water features, orchids and wood carvings. We went on the walkway - super views. We returned in the evening for the light and sound show : ) Good restaurants within the park and icecream/drinks carts dotted around aswell. Super place to visit.",,
,,Amazing place,5,,"A big place for me ,I think it's a good place to visit ,If you have spare time or traveling in singapore ,Please go there , You will never regret it",,
,,Fantastic. A must visit when you鈥檙e in Singapore,5,,Visited with my elderly mother and my sister. A nice respite from the heat. Although it was also quite cold. But that鈥檚 what you should expect. So bring a wrap or shawl.,,
,,brilliant choice,5,,"lots to see and all were excellent. also did the light show which was fab, you walk through the marina bay sands hotel. lots of places for food. went to sky walk way, cloud forest and flower dome.",,
,,In Awe!,5,,"Amazing variety of flora and fauna I have never seen! Went with my 70yr old mother and beat the crowd once the doors open on a Sat morning and enjoyed a lovely stroll in the Cloud Forest, taking photos with nobody in the background. By the time we got to the Flower Dome, there was a crowd already. Going to the Cloud Forest first made sense as there would be queues to join just to get into the lift up to the skybridge if we had gone later. While the flower dome had more open space to walk and no queues required.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,Really very beautiful gardens and views of the marina bay sands. We went at dusk and watched the area come alive with runners and cyclists. Satay by the bay was our dinner stop and was full of yummy hawker-esq type stalls.,,
,,sakura matsuri flower dome,4,,very nice place and like the japanese theme and the dolls too. hope there are more sakura trees at one area then will be very nice.,,
,,A must attraction,5,,"Really nice attraction for travelers or even locals ! The place is cold so remember to bring jacket but it depends on the crowd . This place able to gain knowledge on flowers , plants and they even have sakura till april 鈥?8 ! (You don鈥檛 have to travel all the way to Japan or Taiwan hahaha)",,
,,The most famous hotel in Singapore,5,,"Very unique design, the location of the swimming pool is a perfect place for viewing the entire Singapore.",,
,,Cherry blossom showvsse,5,,Headed down to the flower dome once again to see the beautiful display of the cherry blossom since it鈥檚 the Sakura season!! Really pretty flowers! Good crowd control and perfect weather to be in!!,,
,,Like a stroll in the park,5,,"Absolutely love taking my visitors to Gardens by the Bay, apart from looking at all the wonderful trees and plants from around the world, its COOL (as in NOT HOT) which is fabulous when in Singapore. Both sections are a must and there is something for everyone. The waterfall is amazing as are all the different sculptures.",,
,,Amazing,5,,"Truly a botanical wonder. Singapore is one of the few cities in the world that strives to coexist in harmony with nature, and the gardens are the perfect showcase of this symbiotic relationship. Watching the amazing sound and light show in the supertree grove was one of the highlights of our trip. There are 2 to 3 shows every night, and these can be timed so that you manage to catch the light show on the oppsite side of the Marina Bay Sands either before or after. The cloud and flower domes are also worth a visit as each is a unique experience. Definitely not to be missed when planning a trip to Singapore.",,
,,Pleasant temperature to walk,3,,"If you don't like heights, probably best not to do this as you need to walk over a high narrow bridge. A pleasant temperature and interesting plants. The attraction kept us busy for about 3 hours and a great view of Marina Bay Sands.",,
,,Gardens By The Bay Sakura Exhibition,4,,"The Sakura exhibition this year was fulfilling with a wide variety of sakura trees, and the atmosphere was warm and friendly. Would be better if there were more information on the different sakura types which can help enhance the experience of the trip as we learn about thing while experiencing something special that we do not have in Singapore.",,
,,Must visit when in Singapore,4,,"Gud place to visit with family and kids, the 2 domes are gud especially the clout forest is one of it's kind and you'll love it for sure. The giant tress glow in the night offering a spectecular view, and the show in the evening at Supertree grove is a nice treat to the eyes.",,
,,Wonderful Couple of Hours,5,,"I went to the Gardens by the Bay on a Sunday afternoon in February. The lines were not too busy. I recommend purchasing a ticket in advance for the two domes in advance, although the lineups to purchase admissions tickets did not seem too busy. There is a paid shuttle service to the two domes, but the ~10 minute walk was not too burdensome.

Flower Dome changes its plantation once a quarter so it's worth going for multiple visits if re-visiting Singapore. Cloud Forest is also an excellent place to visit although the elevator lines were a bit of a wait. I would also recommend visiting the supertree area as that was an interesting site. I did not visit the other areas of the gardens and spent a few hours there, but will likely do so on a future visit.",,
,,An Amazing Place,5,,"The kind of thing you'd only expect to find in a Singapore, or maybe Dubai. Definitely, ""over the top"", near the Marina Bay area, there are both outdoor gardens and 2 huge indoor experiences. Best to start with the 20 minute tram tour that takes you through the outdoor spaces. The 2 indoor spaces are like giant greenhouses, (fully air conditioned) . Best described as a botanical garden on steroids. Must see in Singapore!",,
,,Just Beautiful!,5,,"We had limited time to visit the gardens as it was coming towards the end of our day, When we arrived we saw that they were doing 20 minute tours by tourist train and this was a good way for us to get an overview on a limited time. It also gave us a narratory to understand the ethos of the gardens. Be aware that they don't take credit card for the tours - cash only. There is a very good quality gift shop too. The 'trees' are amazing and there are also lots of other interesting sculptures and features. We didn't have time to go in the giant conservatory housing an enormous diversity of plants. You could easily spend a morning or afternoon here. There is a children's play an education area.",,
,,Amazed,5,,"The supertrees were absolutely stunning, especially at night when the lights were on. The light show was mindblowing really ---- definitely a highlight during my stay in Singapore.

In contrast, the flower dome and cloud forest were too overcrowded (it was weekend when i visited). Too many people were busy taking selfies, and I could see probably more people than plants...... Would highly recommend those who would like to visit to try doing so on weekdays.",,
,,Pretty Sakura,4,,Very pretty good looking of Sakura and decoration. Cooling good enough comparing previous air gon temperature at cactus area where was so warm that we almost were perspiration just we stepped in.,,
,,A must for anyone visiting Singapore,5,,"This is my 5th visit to Gardens in the Bay and it never ever disappoints. I can see why Trip Advisor gave it a certificate of excellence in 2016! Where do I start, from the amazing events at in the Flower Dome, this time it was Japanese Cherry Blossom to the the world famous light show in the gardens. The music in tune with the lights... Jurassic Park, Big country etc was mesmerising! I could go on, but better still I would recommend you see it for yourself! Best time to go is 6pm as the sun starts to go down, do the flower dome first and then move on to the gardens. Also use the Bayfront metro.",,
,,Flower Dome - Sakura,5,,The exhibition of the sakura are really pretty! It is so convenient for those who wanna see sakura and is unable to go overseas during this period :) It is a very romantic place for couple to take nice pictures together as well :),,
,,Great place to spend half day,5,,"It鈥檚 amazing how Singapore has become a business & tourist hub from absolutely nothing, and gardens by the bay is a great example of their vision & brilliance. You can easily spend half a day here if not more. Loved the cloud dome, definitely worth a visit. Didn鈥檛 get time to see the flower dome. Strolled through the park, loved the lake side walkway. The super tree light show is also pretty neat. Didn鈥檛 get a chance to do the skywalk. Overall, a great experience.",,
,,Sakura Matsuri at GBTB,5,,So impressed with the beautiful floral displays during the Sakura Matsuri event. The staff at the Gardens did an amazing job. So proud of this iconic attraction. GBTB never disappoints. Will definitely visit GBTB again.,,
,,Flower dome,5,,Sakura flowers so nice and all kinds of flowers that i took photo wow its really all so beautiful...,,
,,Sakura season,4,,Overall visit was nice.. flowers are well maintain. Looking forward to other flower season soon! Must visit !!,,
,,Awesome place,5,,Garden by the bay is a must go. They have a wide variety of tree and flowers which was really beautiful.,,
,,Sakura,4,,"Nice decoration of cherry blossom, it would be great if more on sakura but the air cond there is super cold.",,
,,Overall is good,4,,It was too crowded on the 24 March visit. Should control the number of people of entering the venue.,,
,,Cloudforest,5,,"We could manage to view the cloudforest and flower dome. This was splendid! It's amazing how they've designed and are maintaining the ranforest stuff and the educational info were amazing. Flower dome is excellent, with plants from all over the world. Would keep going back every single chance comes.",,
,,Beautiful and unique!,4,,We didn鈥檛 get a lot of time here but it was very interesting to see and learn more about it. Super Trees looked great at night when lit up.,,
,,One of the best,5,,"If you are a nature lover, this is THE place to visit in Singapore. Although man-made, this is one wonderful creation that even the nature will be proud of. Every few months, they create a new bloom of flowers that we generally dont get to see. When we weent, it was the Sakura cherry blossom festival. It also has sections dedicated for some countries/continents.

It is so satisfying and peaceful to be there. If you love nature, it is a must visit",,
,,Awesome light show,5,,"My husband and I visited during a 2 night stay prior to our cruise and had purchased the Singapore night tour via Trip Advisor.
Our meeting point was Gardens by the bay and we saw the light show which was impressive and entertaining. A musical and lights extravaganza. Great kick start to our 2 day itinerary. Although there鈥檚 no actual charge to see the show so you can just gather there and watch. Plenty of places to get food and a tiger beer too!",,
,,"Good visit, but a light show is a light show",3,,"While this visit for the light show was nice, for a 15 minute show that is really just flashing lights set to the musical scores of some big-name movies it is just that - a light show.",,
,,Night time light show fantastic,5,,Go in the evening to catch the light and music show - as good as any Disney show and uses their music!,,
,,Amazing!,5,,"We arrived at the Gardens around 3 o鈥檆lock, and bought tickets for the bus tour. It took about 20 minutes and was good to see outlining areas, and learn a little bit about the gardens.
I鈥檇 pre-purchased tickets for the flower dome and cloud forest (although didn鈥檛 need to), and we enjoyed walking around at a leisurely pace. We enjoyed the Sakura Matsuri display, but guess this changes on a regular basis.
We purchased tickets for the skywalk and told there was a 30 minute queue, but it was a lot quicker, and after a short lift ride we were looking out over the whole park. Luckily by this time it was sunset, and we saw the 鈥榯rees鈥?lighting up. The staff do make sure you don鈥檛 linger on the walkway, but this doesn鈥檛 spoil it at all.
To watch the light show we lay on our backs on the grass area by the skywalk.
There is a coffee shop - and McCafe - on site.
Highly recommended half day trip.",,
,,Unbelievable serene,5,,"We visited Garden by the Bay on a Saturday morning and it was packed with tourist. Still, with the perfect outlay of the gardens you never felt squashed. The Cloud Dome was absolutely magnificent and breathtakingly beautiful. The Flower Dome took my breath away with all the thousands of flower species which are cleverly spread in a beautiful display.
I can definitely recommend this as an outing for old or young. Time well spent ...",,
,,Amazing!,5,,"We went at night to watch the light show, it was incredible. Stayed to wait for the next show the following hour as well! Lying on the ground to watch the show was so cool. Arrived too late to go into the two dimes as they stop selling tickets by 8.30. Definitely worth a visit just for the light show though.",,
,,Overwhelming view,5,,What is interesting in Gardens by the Bay is that all are man-made and everything is cool in the eyes. A great place to relax and unwind from the busy city of Manila. :),,
,,Incredible sight,5,,"Amazing! Must see when in Singapore! It鈥檚 otherworldly in its presence, and the light shows set to music at night are magical.",,
,,Wow!,5,,"We loved the gardens. We didn鈥檛 go in to the two domes because we enjoyed the surrounds so much but they looked great and reasonably priced too. The kids splash play area looked fantastic, I wished I鈥檇 brought my bathers!",,
,,Stunning,5,,This was my second visit. It was just as stunning as the first. I love how the themes change. So many different plant varieties to explore and so beautiful. My favourite are the orchids,,
,,Fabulous flowers & trees,5,,"We spent 2 hours going through the Flower Garden pod & were amazed at the variety of the world's flowers that was there. Next we spent 3 hours going through the ""Cloud Forest"" pod with a 7 story waterfall and amazing walkways in the air to view all the plants & trees.",,
,,Supertrees!,5,,The supertrees and the walkway were the highlight of our visit. We were blown away by them!! The rest of the gardens are good too!,,
,,Needs decluttering,3,,"This is a must visit place in Singapore, however, it needs sorting out.

The focus should be on plants yet too often other distractions get in the way. For example in the Flower Dome there is a profusion of bad art everywhere. By 鈥榖ad art鈥?I mean tacky and irrelevant artworks placed around and among the plants. What a travesty.

Someone needs to take this place back to its core purpose before it disappears under the kitsch.",,
,,Nice experience for every nature lover!,5,,"As the name says it is a garden by the bay- Twin domes viz Flower dome and Cloud dome.
Flower dome was full of bright and beautiful flowers aplenty of varieties accross the world. Lots of photo clicking.
Cloud dome had amazing water fall and views with important message of Global warming and reduce recycle reuse.

A must visit for the complete family!",,
,,Beautiful like the rest of Singapore!,5,,"I am not a flower enthusiast or anything of the sort, however, I really enjoyed visiting the Gardens by the Bay when I was in Singapore. There are so many exhibits to see and there are so many things you can learn here. It was also great to escape the Singapore heat and humidity and be inside here for a couple hours!",,
,,Interesting,4,,Worth a visit. Good entertainment for the kids. Worthbuying the tickets online for savings. We were so lucky to see thecherry blossoms,,
,,Great for a relaxing wander through beautiful gardens,5,,A truly amazing collection of plants beautifully displayed. Great during the day and stunning at night when lit. The sound and music show is just spectacular and all for free.,,
,,Excellent,5,,Wonderful must do experience while in Singapore. Every exhibit is very well displayed and beautiful. The whole area is very well organised so there is plenty of room even when it is busy. Very good value for money.,,
,,A happy cool place,5,,"I have visited Gardens By the Bay esp Flower Dome many times, every few months esp when they have a specific display. It is a fun place for all ages. I am very thankful for the team at Gardens by the Bay for creating this beautiful place. Keep up the good work.",,
,,"Great place to visit for an hour or two, or all day.",5,,"This is a large place with the 2 domes of attractions (admission fee) plus expansive gardens (no charge). You can easily spend a day here or just an hour or two enjoying the Gardens. There is a McDonalds & souvenir shops near domes & a nice Food Centre called Satay by the Bay near the water for a good selection of local cuisine. Marina Bay is nearby so if you have time, can check that out also. Can be reached by the MRT.",,
,,FANTABULOUS and MUST VISIT IN SINGAPORE,5,,"If you want to see the real beauty of garden and the cloud forest feeling the do visit this place and it is accessible with all PUBLIC transport system, we took MRT from somerset where our hotel was there and in 10 SGD we were at BAYFRONT (you ned to change lines to get to BAYFRONT) so that you can reach to marina sands bay and Gardens by the bay, Gardens by the bay and marina sands bay are right next to each other, you can stop over for good photo shoot for marina sands bay.

You can get COMBO ticket for all garden tickets reasonably, don't go for any tour operator you can get it on your own at the entrance.

Just remember you have to walk a lot as gardens are huge.

There are 2 theme gardens with a SUPER TREE bridge.

1. Flower dome
2. Cloud Forest
3. Super Tree with light show.

All the gardens are majestic and cloud forest also have elevators for elders as you can go right at the top for aerial view of cloud forest.

The flower dome as thousands of flower which are different from each other, a truly magnificent view.",,
,,Very scenic,4,,This area has wonderful vistas of the bay and Singapore River. The Gardens and both biomes are a must see. Around 7pm the lights illuminate the magnificent structures and skywalk. Stunning.,,
,,Spectacular!,5,,"This is a wonderful place to visit. We went early before the crowds and were able to see everything in a relaxed, unhurried way. We began with the Flower Dome which was beautifully set out and we were especially lucky to see the extensive display of Japanese cherry blossom. The Cloud Forest was also magnificent from the impressive waterfall to the exhibits on every level of the elevated walkway, including the one on global warming. There was an entrance charge for the two domes but it was well worth it. The rest of the gardens were also interesting, impressive, spectacular 鈥?it鈥檚 difficult not to give a whole list of adjectives! We particularly liked the Kingfisher Lake and the Waterlily Pond. There were restaurants around for food and drink but we chose to go over the Dragonfly Bridge and have lunch at Ce La Vi at the top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel.",,
,,beautiful,5,,dont miss as such beautiful gardens - cloud was a welcome and cool break form that. Didnt get chance to go back at night but the view from Spago on the top of the Marina Bay Sands was fantastic of the gardens and the lights.,,
,,Stunning,5,,"Sensory overload, the most amazing collection of plants imaginable. Some of the settings are a bit glitzy and beware the masses of selfie absorbed tourists waving their phones about. Bring a jacket because it can get cold after a while, numbingly cold. Eat elsewhere before you come as its a bit pricey and there can be line ups. And remember, bring a jacket, the air con in the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome is set low. Note that these are the only two I visited.",,
,,Amazing.,5,,"We had a family visit to the Gardens and thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of our experience. The Domes were excellent, although can get very crowded at certain times. You need to allow a fair bit of time, to view it all, but well worth it. If you visit late afternoon, by the time you have finished in the Domes you can then take up a position for the light show at 7.45, which is not to be missed, truly a wonderful sight.",,
,,Highlight,5,,"What a great place you will be amazed by these Gardens.The Gardens must be seen by day and night and take your camera,the views from the skywalk are awesome.The night show with music is a must.",,
,,Oh my goodness the best best best part of Singapore,5,,You could spend days exploring everything. Breathtaking design both nature and man made. Don鈥檛 miss it.,,
,,Amazing!,5,,One of the best place with flowers that I鈥檝e seen!!! There are Lots of flowers from different parts of the world. The temperature inside is very low.,,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,This is a MUST visit. So amazing. Going back in a few weeks so cant wait as missed the light show last time.,,
,,A great day out,4,,"A lovely place to visit, when visiting Singapore. Lots to do and see, for all ages. Make sure you wear comfy shoes.",,
,,Cloud Forest and WaterFalls,5,,We had a good time in Cloud Forest. The tallest indoor waterfalls was very nice to see. We enjoyed walking inside the dome and it was amazing to see the structure. Overall good place to visit. The light and sound show was good.,,
,,"Gorgeous, unique and they could be free",5,,"If you are staying anywhere near the Marina area it is easy to walk into the gardens either via a walkway along the shore or through the Marina Bay Sands hotel building.
Most of the gardens can be explored for free and the majority are wheelchair accessible.
The only areas you have to pay for are the Domes and the skywalk
Both of these are worth the admission although the skywalk is quite short.
The public areas of the gardens are much quieter especially away from the ""trees"" and it is worth going early as the temperatures are nicer.
If you have time we would go to the Domes early one day and the gardens early or late another. The Domes get busy mid morning especially with the popular cherry blossom at the moment.
There is a light show at 7.45pm and 8.45pm daily which can be viewed for free from the gardens or from a nearby vantage point.
Great park area for walking or jogging.Look out for birds.",,
,,Entertaining and educating at the same time,5,,"Going there with 2 of my girls, I went to the Flower Dome and also Cloud Forest. There鈥檚 a lot of place for taking cool pictures. Technology is on point 馃憣馃徎",,
,,Fantastic,5,,"We missed out on a visit to the gardens on our last visit but made sure we visited this time and how glad we were to do this! It is an overwhelming, romantic experience! A definite must.. some where to return to!",,
,,Beautiful gardens,5,,We went here on our first night was amazing lovely views and a beautiful place to go at night with the light show on. The Dom's are lovely to look in but outside is better looking at the gardens and the spectacular lights! Highly recommend here when visiting,,
,,This place is a must to visit,5,,Great place to go alone or with family. Amazing nature of rainforest and all the flowers around. Really impressive,,
,,It's god gift,5,,Oh my god. I'm so excited about the Gardens flowers Very flowers I can't see ever never . I'm proud About the Gardens management . They are very carefully mentane. I want to go again to the Gardens .,,
,,Good day with the flowers,5,,Visited gardens by the Bay alone! Everyone should try to eat the local food there at satay by the Bay!,,
,,Great display of a wide variety of vegetations,5,,"the two glass domes cover a wide variety of plants from across the globe. In addition, the artificial trees in the adjacent park are quite spectacular",,
,,A must see,5,,"A truly fabulous experience. Hundreds of flowers and plants and trees, areas beautifully themed, ie Alice in Wonderland, different countries/continents. Two domes, flower and cloud - visit both as they are well worth it.",,
,,Impressive landscape,5,,Brought by my cousin here as it is a must visit in Singapore. Impressive man-made waterfall and night musical show. Love the overall experience a lot and took many pictures.,,
,,Gardens by the bay,4,,"Ok place, not much of a wow factor. Cool area though which is good considering Singapore weather. I feel it's too expensive to get in there because there is not much to see instead of flowers after flowers.",,
,,Beauty,5,,What a beautiful place. Gardens by the Bay is a beautiful place to be in and spend your day with a great variety of plants and flowers along with it's wonderful waterfall. The entry fee was reasonable and fair and it was very easily accessible.,,
,,Best attraction in Singapore,5,,If you would only have one day in Singapore I would definitely recommend going to Gardens by the bay. The park itself is free but don鈥檛 miss out on Flower Dome and Cloud Forest even though they have an entrance fee of around 20 USD (in total for both). A recommendation would be to arrive during the afternoon perhaps around 4 pm and walk around the park and do Flower Dome and Cloud Forest which will take you at least 3h. If it is hot outside you can go in the domes and cool off (you might need an extra sweater inside as it can be a bit cold after a while). Then in the evening you stick around and catch the free light show at Supertree Grove which starts at 7.45 and 8.45 pm. Be there a little earlier if you want to get a good viewing spot. As you end your evening in the Gardens you can walk to Marina Bay and catch the water and light show there.,,
,,"If you only have time for 1 activity or place to visit in Singapore, then Gardens by the Bay would be the top choice.",5,,"The concept of Gardens By the Bay is mind blowing. It is conveniently located at the Bayfront MRT in the beautiful Marina Bay area. The main highlights are the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome, the light show in the evening and the OCBC skyway.",,
,,A must see in Singapore,5,,This is an exceptionally well done botanical wonderland in Singapore. The range of plants is superb and the presentation is great. You can easily spend 2-3 hours here including the cloud forest and flower dome. The buildings are exceptional in their own right . It was plum blossom (Sakura) time when we visited and their display was very photogenic. The domes are so large and displays are on multi levels (but all wheelchair accessible) that it didn't feel crowded. There is a final display on climate change and how individuals can make a difference. There are lovely (free) garden areas around the two domes making for nice walks and a walkway to the Marina Bay Sands.,,
,,A little bit of manmade beauty...,4,,"We enjoyed our visits in the conservatories, we actually went back on a Monday morning as it was very busy at the weekends. The conservatories are beautifully done, plenty of seating areas. The cafes we went in were a little disappointing, service was a little unfriendly and not as clean as I would have liked...food was OK though.",,
,,Lovely!,4,,"Beautiful gardens and very well maintained. They should allow bikes and hire out bikes for the whole gardens, and they should also have a buggy cart thing (don't know the name) for a tour of the gardens as the domes were tiring.

The coffee shop at the beginning 'cafe crema', had eggs benedict which was cold. Very disappointing. The coffee was nice though.",,
,,"Enjoyed the Cloud Forest, the Flower dome 鈥?not so much",3,,"One of the features of the Singapore skyline, the Gardens by the Bay super trees are a notable element of the Gardens by the Bay. There are public gardens, a multi-storey Cloud forest (easily accessible via lifts, escalators, etc.) and a large low-level flower dome. There is a light show (not amazing) in the evening.

The Cloud Forest features a large waterfall and an ambling walk around the perimeter of lush tropics, green gardens. There are some interesting stalactite's and stalagmites on display (wonder how they were removed from their original sports and transported!), and interest sculptures fashioned from polished and worked timber.

We were perhaps unlucky with the timing of our visit to the Flower dome as they were readying it for what promised to be a very busy cherry blossom festival and we were left with displays being reworked and some pretty dreary and uninteresting displays.

There was also a big function on in the function room which is part of the Flower Dome and the high-tech presentations taking place didn't add to the atmosphere. Also the skywalk wasn't operating.

It's an expensive visit and while it was worth seeing it wouldn't be on the ""see-again"" list unless there was a very significant special exhibition taking place. Plenty of shops, a few restaurants and afterwards we decided to follow the signs to the satay club which turned out to be an excellent food complex with a range of eating places, but certainly a much further walk than the signs suggested.",,
,,"good few hours to spend, very pretty, expensive",4,,"we did enjoy a walk in these gardens, but so many extras to keep paying...comes to an expensive afternoon...lovely though, took some lovely photos",,
,,Beautiful running spot in Singapore,5,,I needed to find a place to go for a long run in Singapore and the Gardens by the Bay fit the bill well. There鈥檚 a lot of wide open running paths with beautiful sculptures and scenery.,,
,,Great place to walk around before the sun comes up or at night,5,,Great gardens but you really get the most out of the place when you see it in the dark. It feels light you鈥檙e in the movie Avatar. Magnificent gardens!! Highly recommended.,,
,,Beautiful,5,,Definitely one of a kind experience. All the thought that went into the gardens definitely shows. Worth a visit!,,
,,An absolute must when in Singapore,5,,I visit Singapore since 1972 frequently (2-3 times a year). The city is a miracle. Visit the Gardens - you shall not regret.,,
,,Amazing lights display at the Gardens on the Bay,5,,"We visited Singapore early January on a nights stopover on our way to NZ.
We stayed at the Crowne Plaza Changi airport hotel and decided to go into central Singapore in the evening. We were really pleased we did as we watched the amazing light display at the Marina Gardens on the Bay.
An excellent display and lovely memory of Singapore. The MRT service dropped us right outside the gardens and was a quick and relatively cheap way of getting to and from the airport.
One not to be missed when you are in Singapore.",,
,,Recommended,4,,If you like gardens these are worth visiting. Recommend visiting both domes although they do get busy. Definitely worth paying to visit these.,,
,,The park is something different and spot on the middle of the city east to get to. A bit pricey for enter all the dome .,4,,It's a good park and most famous place to visit if you're in Singapore. Each dome cost money to enter. At night also have lights show .,,
,,free and fun light show,5,,"nice garden where you can relax and enjoy the special light show. should be cool for young kids, especially.",,
,,Beautiful gardens and lights show at night,4,,We spent half a day going through 2 domes. It happened the cherry blossom garden were opened on 16/03/18. They have tea room built for tea ceremony rickshaw dolls in kimonos plenty cherry blossom trees make us feel we are actually in Japan for cherry blossom season. It鈥檚 magnificent! We went for the lights show and were not disappointed. Enjoy it very much then we walked to the harbour for a taxiboat ride. Beautiful with all lights lt up the sky even the merlino.,,
,,Best team,5,,"Best tour i have ever experiance thanks to Colin ,Yap,Ty lovely team and recommend every one who is travaling to Singapore to try them . Finally thanks alot for all your support team BOOM BOOM 锟?
,,Certainly worth a visit,4.0,,I found the cloud forest and flower dome the most impressive attractions. Unfortunately the Skyway was closed.
,,The light show is well worth the wait,5.0,,Awesome experience and well worth a visit"," there is so much to see and do there and the two domes are air conditioned so its an easy walk round.""",
,,Gorgeous,5,,We went at night and my god it was stunning! We walked through the gardens from near the marina by the bay and then lay on the grass near the restaurants inside the gardens to watch the light show. Must see whilst in Singapore!,,
,,A must-see in Singapore,5,,We spent 4 hours at Gardens by the Bay and loved all of it. The Cloud Forest is an absolute highlight and worth the entrance fee. It is beautifully laid out and very very cool...which for Singapore is a real bonus.,,
,,Amazing both day and night,5,,The gardens by the bay is simply stunning we visited during the day at first and loved wandering around gardens and then again in the evening to see the super trees light up the light and music show was beautiful a credit to Singapore not only is this a beautiful site to visit but is an important part of conservation,,
,,Beautiful!!,5,,Highly recommend visiting! Beautiful gardens. Very friendly and helpful staff! I would recommend paying the extra price to visit the indoor gardens. Orchids are amazing. Loved the indoor waterfall. Plan on spending a few hours.,,
,,Sakura session,3,,"The Sakura was not fully bloomed when we went on 15 Mar 18. The flowers in the dome were unique. However, should considered lowering the price for Singaporeans. Not really worth the money.",,
,,Amazing tour,5,,This is a remarkable sight in Singapore. The light show in the evening is beautiful and the restaurant in the tree is a great idea (didn't eat there though). Well worth checking out.,,
,,Spring Garden All Year Round,5,,"Gardens By The Bay is always better then the last visit as they always have ""special"" display. The display this time around was Japan in Spring. The Plum and Cherry blossoms were in full bloom and the Azaleas provided a spectacular background contrast. The Cloud Dome as usual was captivating with all sizes and colours of orchids. Just the various leaves with their varying shapes, textures and colours was mesmerizing. At minimum 5 hrs to view the place, ramps for wheel chairs and strollers. We started at 3pm and left at 8.30 pm this allowed us to see trees in the day, have lovely satay for dinner and see the lighted trees as we left. Lovely sunset views of the river and Singapore Flier.",,
,,Enchanting display of lights!,5,,"We went to see the two domes and managed to catch the free supertree grove lights show. Awesome!

Don't miss it! At one point they played some disney tunes and we sang tje words to ""When You wish Upon A Star"", it was so magical.

The themes should change according to the season but that is what makes it so fresh each time.",,
,,Even as a resident this place blows my mind away,5,,"It is like the movie Avatar meeting Star Wars, so futuristic but also soulful, playful and just gourgeous! Don鈥檛 miss the sound and lightshow every night at 19.45 and 20.45, so beautiful! Clode forest and Childrens by the bay are also really great.",,
,,Spectacular- allow enough time,4,,"Allow lots of time. There is so much to see.

It is a must see if you like botany, flowers or photography. It is spectacular.

Walking through the park is an experience in it self. The design of the gardens and overwhelming variety of plants are amazing.

There are statues and carvings incorporated throughout the gardens. Many of these are spectacular and really adds to the overall design.

Try to find a time that is not too busy. The experience in the domes are impacted by too many people. It makes it impossible to soak in all that is there.

Allow time to go to Satay by the Bay for something to eat. It鈥檚 worth while.",,
,,Impressive Diversity,5,,Incredible Natural Site! Affordable Entry but needs a few days to enjoy fully. Walk in the park is free.,,
,,gardens by the bay are amazing at night,5,,"Gardens By The Bay are beautiful. The best kept secret is to go there at night for the Light Show...and its free. I gather most nights around 8:30/8:45pm it commences, not entry fee into the gardens. It turns into a spectacular lights show with music. The night we were there it had a Chinese music theme. you lay on the ground or find a good position and watch the light show of the amazing structures. In the back ground all the time hovering is Marina Bay Sands building....",,
,,Beautiful,5,,Visited here in the afternoon and went in both conservatories - stunning! We then watchex the light show which was amazing. We wish we had gone earlier in the day to give us chance to look round some of the gardens - didn't realise how long it would take so long to look round the conservatories. When i go back to Singapore I will make an early start!,,
,,So much to see!,5,,This is one of the few sites we had to pay to get in to but reasonable and definitely worth the money! It offers a nice cool climate; a good break from the day's heat!,,
,,Impressive space and collection of trees from around the world,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is a very cool place to escape the heat of Singapore. It's 'cool' for it's collection of plants, especially the unusual trees and cool, as in temperate and lower humidity. Worth a couple of hours to explore the dome.",,
,,Imaginative remodelling of what a botanic garden is.,4,,Two enormous greenhouses and giant tree are the highlights of the gardens. Note that the aerial walkway between the trees is closed during rainstorms because of the potential for lightning strike.,,
,,Fantastic and Free!,5,,"An amazing park located near the Marina Sands and directly on the subway line. You can walk amongst beautiful flowers all day if you鈥檇 like. See the towering man made flowers. If you want a more in-depth visit, pay to enter the domes with their rain forest atmosphere and magnificent flowers. Otherwise, just meander through the beautiful sculptures and plants.",,
,,Nothing like it,5,,"This was one of the highlights of our visit. The gardens are artfully arranged and contain many unique sculptures that make walking through it a delight. The huge rainforest walk at first appears daunting, but is really fun and affords a good view of a variety of rain forest plants.",,
,,You will go there again and again,5,,"I visited here twice. Once it was with friends and the second time with my family. Singapore is one of the biggest cities in the world. But when you enter Gardens by the Bay, you can see a city among woods.",,
,,"Amazing, so beautiful",5,,"The Gardens by the Bay, left me speechless. Was incredible, lovely to walk around it the blazing hot sun.",,
,,Floral Bonanza,5,,"MUST do both domes, and don't miss the evening light and sound show. You will need at least half a day here to fully appreciate the exhibits.",,
,,"Amazing, worth the stop over",5,,"We stopped over for a couple of nights during our SE Asia tour just to see this, and it was so worth doing. The variety and health of the plants is outstanding. The light show each evening is a must, and is free. You only pay if you want to go into the 2 massive glass houses, which you must. I was concerned it would be unbearably hot inside, but it isn鈥檛, and in fact was a nice respite from the heat outside. A must do for any plant lover.",,
,,Out of world experience!,5,,"visited the gardens by the bay twice. The first time, was late evening around 8 PM to see the light and sound show. On this particular occasion, we watched the show right by the trees, laying down and looking up. It was quite amazing. The whole place and concept has a very sci-fi feel to it. we did not need a ticket to see the Light and sound show.

The second time, we went late afternoon. We bought tickets to go see the cloud forest and the flower garden, both of which require tickets. We ended the evening with watching the light and sound show again. This time, watched from a distance and was a completely different experience. Strongly recommend Both if you have time. There are also some excellent panoramic views of the city from the bridge leading up to the trees.",,
,,Awesome Place to Visit,5,,"Very much to see here. Gardens, paths all over, tours, botanical garden. Always new landscaping being added,",,
,,A Must Do,5,,"If you find yourself in Singapore you really must visit Gardens by the Bay! Our first visit was in the evening for the lights and music show! I found this very moving and emotional. It's on twice nightly and FREE! Do go during the day to visit the giant ""trees"" , the rain-forest dome is especially good you can spend an hour or more here, it's very interesting/educational/fun!
Visit the flower dome for ever changing exhibition.
Just stroll around the grounds to be amazed by the planting.
There are also outdoor showers/playground for kids to cool off
Plan to spend a whole day here, get here early......a taxi from your hotel is best",,
,,A must see in Singapore,5,,"Title says it all - the cloud forest, super trees and flower dome - things that the future might look like with giant metallic tree structures amidst two huge conservatories with the most fascinating flora.

Ongoing right now is the Sakura display - catch it if you can!",,
,,A magnificent Day Out in Singapore.,5,,We took the Hop-on bus Yellow route and changed to the Blue route as this the only one that goes to The Gardens by the Bay. It was an extremely hot day so took the Audio Tour which takes you all around the Gardens explaining the natural habitat of all the plants It was very interesting & we certainly would not have been able to enjoy all the Gardens by foot. There are eating places within the complex. I strongly recommend this.,,
,,Lovely gardens and Domes,5,,"We bought tickets on line for both Domes and the bridge saving 30% the Domes take around 2 hrs the cloud dome was my favourite, but both are nice to visit if you like plants and flowers.
Outside the gardens are lovely and we spent 2 hrs wandering around and stopping off at Satay by the bay for lunch.
We saw otters and had an enjoyable day.",,
,,Wow!,5,,"Simply a must if you are in Singapore , we went at dusk for dinner stayed for the light show absolutely amazing",,
,,Humanly Natured,4,,"Best time to walk will be in the night- where its cooling and quieter and the lights make it much more colourfully alive. For scenic photography and enjoying the walk in the day, do look out for the weather and the time that you're going, don't forget sunscreen too. There are alot of different species of plants and animals coexisting and the trails are quite educational with information signage regarding specific species, etc. Overall, I would say its a huge garden, and if you are up for some exploration- this is the place to go to. You can walk directly from Marina Bay Sands just by following the signs and its pretty much very straightforward. Again, best time is still at night!",,
,,Flowers galore,5,,"You can spend all day here, so much to look at. We did the tour with explanations of the various displays. We did the cloud walk and went into both domes. So many photos!",,
,,Lovely place for an evening stroll,5,,"We took an evening walk through the gardens, though there are electric vehicles available as well..loved the climate control domes cum glass houses. Lovely exotic plants in there as well. Plan the visit for early evening, the light show is just awesome.",,
,,Gardens By The Bay,5,,Gardens by the Bay is beautiful. Try to schedule your time there to include the light show. AND IT'S FREE!,,
,,Wow!,4,,We visited the gardens at night and stayed for the light show.. definitely a must to see in Singapore.,,
,,Wonderful,5,,"You must visit there when you go to SG. It鈥檚 free for entrance. But u should buy ticket to visit Flower Dome, Cloud Forest. Those are air-conditioned gardens. And u don鈥檛 miss light show in the evening. You can pay for OCBC Skyway (ab 6$SG) to take a stroll through this area.",,
,,A must see-,5,,It was a new theme Cherry blossom as like in Japan. There was people wearing kimono and fashion show Kimono and also tea ceremony show. The designing was very good and colourful. It was nice if theyprovided a program so people knows what鈥檚 they expected to see and the time for the show.,,
,,"Visit to Gardens by the Bay , Singapore",4,,"Beautifully landscaped gardens but a little overhyped in terms of must-see attractions. They look much better in the night with the lights on, but in the day, it's just another nicely done garden.",,
,,Free of charge!,4,,"Just to be clear to all, entrance to the Gardens is completely free of charge, and what a bargain it is!! You only have to pay for entry to either of the domes, or the Sky Walk (pricey for a short walk!). Also the 2 light shows in the evening are free!
As already stated, visit in the cooler mornings, have a break in the afternoon (or cool down in the domes - you鈥檒l need sleeves for those!!), and then return for the light show. The gardens has loads of places to eat, and takes ages to walk round, with its many exhibits. Enjoy!!",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"I am here on business and decided to go see the gardens by the bay. It鈥檚 a short taxi journey from Orchard road and city Center in general and the place did not disappoint.

There is a light show on at 7.45 and then again at 8.45. Note that it鈥檚 the tall trees in front of the indoor forest and not the ones by the Car park/entrance. Show lasts for approximately 5-10 mins and it鈥檚 awesome. Get a good seat, lie back and watch.

I also went in to the flower dome which cost me $18 SIN dollars. Locals pay $10.

This is well worth a visit if your in Singapore.",,
,,An excellent option for walk,5,,"Beautiful park. An excellent option for walking alone, with family or friends. Do not stop going upstairs in the restaurant on the tree. there is a panoramic view of the whole park is a unique view of the Hotel Marina Bay.",,
,,Great place,5,,We only came and saw the light show at night and had a walk around gardens after major attractions had closed but we loved it.,,
,,Amazing in all aspects!,5,,This park is just wonderful. Handicap accessible with elevators for easy access to everything. You do walk but inside both amazing domes it is Air-conditioned so walking is easy. Child friendly for strollers. Great gift shop and food places to enjoy. Stick around for the amazing light show with music. It is fantastic!!,,
,,Gardens By The Bay/ Super Trees,5,,"Get there by MRT, the Cloud Garden and Flower Garden were both superb and my wife ( a keen gardener) thoroughly enjoyed them both.You can buy a ticket for both S20 pp worth .
Go late in the after noon to enjoy the first ""Super Trees Show""",,
,,Amazing views,4,,"Very well made artificial gardens, good views and amazing place to spend time. You can easily spend half your day covering all the gardens.Connected by MRT",,
,,A visit Must,5,,Visiting Singapore without Gardens by the Bay would be the biggest error you could do. Don't miss the evening light shows at 7:45 or 8:45!,,
,,Amazing,5,,"Go there in the evening to see the show with the music and light on the trees. We were there in Novemeber and it was amazing. Just sit on the grass and enjoy it.

It's nice during the day as well but if you have to choose - go there in the evening!",,
,,JUST BEAUTIFUL,4,,These gardens are a nice way to spend a lovely afternoon. The flower garden is just beautiful with an amazing array of plants from all over the world.,,
,,Beautiful Space,4,,"Very large well set out gardens. The main gardens are set out in specific areas, Palm garden, Cactus gardens, Flowers gardens, etc all of this you can walk around for free. They have large man made tree structures that have been carefully planted with flowers and climbers. There is a water playground for children and this is also free. The two main domes THE FLOWER DOME and THE CLOUD DOME attract an entrance fee as does the elevated walkway. We spent 3 hours wandering around and enjoyed it thoroughly",,
,,Light show is a must,5,,The gardens are great and light show is an absolute must. Watching from the ground is great. You can search online for cheaper tickets into the 2 garden domes. If I had to choose I would choose the free light show.,,
,,We only did the free sections and still loved it.,5,,We spent a couple of hours walking around the different areas of the Garden by the Bay. We skipped the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest as we were a bit short on time as well as did not want to pay $28 SGD per person for those attractions.,,
,,Sakura blossom at flower dome,4,,"It was rather crowded and packed with tourists. The flowers were pretty and many people were posing to take pictures. There were staff helping to control human flow and reminding people not to touch or hurt the plants. Temperature in the dome was around 20deg, was v cooling. It got colder after the sunset.",,
,,A MUST SEE,5,,"Beautiful displays of flowers, tree and gardens from around the world. Definitely worth a visit even for the children.",,
,,Amazing Afternoon,5,,"There are two of these domed gardens. One is called ""Clouds"" and is the more interesting of the two structures. The other is a botanical wonderland with hundreds of plant species. Both are very informative and enjoyable. Plan for most of the day and have lunch on the plaza between gardens.",,
,,Must visit for anyone coming to Singapore,5,,Beautiful place where one can see flowers and educate children importance of Mother Nature!! Go early morning or late afternoon to avoid rush,,
,,Beautiful!,5,,While in Singapore we visited Gardens by the bay! It was great such beautiful well cared for gardens! Was lovely and cool inside especially as it was so hot outside! Would highly recommend.,,
,,Beautiful display,5,,"The cloud forest was the highlight for us. An wonderful experience with plants and engineering together! Flower dome was more crowded, but crowd management was good. Well worth the visits. Outside gardens beautiful.",,
,,Love The Flowers,4,,"If you like flowers this is one of the best attractions in Singapore. They have a wide selection of flowers and there cactus garden is very good. I went to photograph the flowers and was not disappointed. The tropical dome is also very interesting, again with a wide selection of plants. The walkway in this dome is fun. Just be prepared for the heights. A few things to keep in mind. On school holidays the placed tends to be packed with people. Hard to get good photos. If there is a line up to get in, go for lunch and come back later. Early in the day is best. The attractions around the domes are good. Food outlets offer a wide selection of different foods. Allow at least half a day.",,
,,Gardens WOW,5,,"Cloud dome and flower dome both amazing and each one completely different Super tree walk, gives you a spectacular view over the gardens and the light show at night is well worth staying for. Colour and music are wonderful,like a fairyland",,
,,Lovely day even with limited time,5,,Walked from the cruise terminal and spent a lovely 2-3 hours wandering around these lovely gardens didn't t go in the two glasshouses but it was just such a lovely place to walk around - Got MRT back,,
,,Quick tour,4,,"We go there on our last day to roam around the city, there are event in the area that to expensive but overall the garden is beautiful and should be visited by every tourist.

You can also have a background of the marina bay sand hotel",,
,,Terrific day,5,,Singapore is fantastic and this is a must visit. Spend a day! So much to see and do. Sonething for everyone.,,
,,A Must Visit When in Singapore,5,,Advice: Do not pass up visiting Gardens by the Bay. We visited it twice during our stay in Singapore. Well worth the time. Well worth the admission price. Exceptional!,,
,,great,5,,it was such a great experience the event was really fun and it was really awesome to see sakura 馃尭馃槏馃槏馃槏,,
,,A Must See!,5,,"A must see for the whole family. Family Friendly, Wheel Chair Accessable, Educational, Inspiring, and Awesome!",,
,,So many small thing u can see,5,,"I never went to the flower dome before but when i went there i tot all i would see is flowers and plants but instead i saw wooden carving of different type of animal, from dragons to some tiki-like stuff and it was really cool! If people have the time and patience to appreciate it im very sure that they will enjoy it",,
,,A brilliant experience,5,,"We are so glad we visited Gardens by the bay. It was so relaxing walking round the gardens away from the hussel and bussel of Singapore.
We visited twice and still did not see all the gardens.
The highlight was visiting the glass domes in the evening after dark, very atmospheric.",,
,,Spectacular Scenary,5,,went for the free light show that they have everyday at 7:45 / 8:45 . Show was about 15 minutes long but worth it. Outside the dome areas is free so you could enjoy a nice walk around the complex. One should make time when visiting Singapore.,,
,,Evening light show,5,,We went about 5 pm and took the shuttle around the gardens and then did our own Exploring. We stayed for the evening light show. The gardens and show were amazing.,,
,,Best tropical garden ever seen,5,,Walking through the bridge penetrate the Marina Bay Sands are definitely most impressive thing I ever had.,,
,,Fantastic place to visit,5,,"Loved the trees, walked for many miles. Be prepared to walk lots including steps. The artificial trees were spectacular.",,
,,beautiful,5,,"A must visit site. Magnificently done. Make sure to go to the Light show in the evening. Very entertaining, and a walk thru the gardens or on a shuttle for a small fee",,
,,What a Beauty,5,,"Great concept, marvelous design. After visiting this, you got to know that why it is the no.1 attractions in Singapore. Altogether a different feel. Inside dome temperature is atleast 5 degree C colder than outside. Better take some shawl with you. A good 3-4 hour activity.",,
,,Light show is the best part,4,,"You鈥檒l need 1 hr max in each domes. But could be longer if you take lots of pics. The mist show in cloud forest doesnt worth the wait.
The garden itself is HUGE. If you want to stroll around the garden Come in late afternoon or even at night, bc the sun is scorching during the day. The light show is worth to see, so coming here around that time is the best time i think",,
,,SAKURA MATSURI,1,,"Very very disappointing. It wasn't like the whole flower dome was filled with sakura as shown in advertisements and photos. It was barely here and there. The entire anime thing inside the flower dome was super unnecessary. We paid for the flower dome to see and take pictures with the flowers, not have unnecessary anime lovers crowd inside. Could barely even take proper photos cos of the anime character people. And honestly, the sakuras were either in its bud, half bloomed, still blooming, dying or dead. So disappointing. Next time gonna read on reviews then visit flower dome. waste of money and time.",,
,,Nicely Maintain,5,,I had a wonderful experience at Gardens by the Bay. The place was being maintained tip-top ..fresh flowers ..great lightings ...feel like at AVATAR settings,,
,,Gardens by the Bay - A great visit,5,,"Allow half a day at a minimum to walk around the gardens, see the Super Trees, and to go into the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome.
Make a point to get into the two domes and see all that is possible there, architecturally, and botanically - it is really impressive.
I would not pay to go up into the super tree cafe / bar again - it was not worth it, and given the views that can be seen from other vantage points close by it offers little more as was a bit run down.",,
,,Must go,4,,Pretty flower gardens.. your trip to Singapore is not complete if you don't stop by to take a picture.. there is a free light show every night around 7.45 and 8.45 at night.,,
,,Beautiful,5,,You can spend a day or two in this area. So nice and green. There is an area for food that is for local food vendors. The cloud forest is a must! Great place to either just relax or walk around and sightsee.,,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,Lovely garden with lots of pretty flowers. Good for photo taking. Follow me on Instagram - @aliciacho to see my photos :),,
,,The Flower Dome - Garden By The Bay,5,,Very impressive and we enjoyed ourselves very much. We definitely will go again. We strongly recommend this place.,,
,,A 鈥渄o not miss 鈥?attraction,5,,"We visited the Gardens during the day and spent most of our time in the Domed gardens.
They are an extraordinary experience: breathtakingly beautiful, fastidiously maintained, self sustaining environmentally, and a wonderful respite from the heat and humidity of the city.
Our only regret is that we did not have time to return to see them lit up at night 鈥?I can only imagine how beautiful they would be.
Our #1 attraction from this city visit",,
,,Fabulous!,5,,"We took a very fast visit to the gardens as they looked fantastic from the high viewing point of the adjacent hotel. We were most impressed. They are very unusual, imaginative and a delight to walk around. Located near the subway station makes an easy visit. Upgrading work is ongoing at the moment so that is a small inconvenience. We would love to have made our visit longer, but thoroughly enjoyed the time we spent there.",,
,,Nice place to Visit,5,,It is a great place to visit. Get to know about nature and really wonder how they made a forest inside the building. From there you can find a great view of Singapore for some photo session. Really a great experience!!!,,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,"Everyone who visits Singapore must visit the Gardens the Domes are quite spectacular, allow plenty of time to really appreciate them both. Although the weather conditions closed the high level walkway, we went up to the restaurant and bar level for the included soft drink, we then went to the viewing platform, great 360掳 views over town and bay.",,
,,Well worth a visit,5,,"Allow plenty of time to see it all. We recommend going in the evening to see the gardens lit up. We feel the best time would be mid afternoon so you can see it in daylight and then stay there until after the lights get turned on. We went in the morning but as our time in Singapore was limited we were trying to get so much in, unfortunately we were too tired to return for the evening.",,
,,Totally Amazing,5,,You definitely have to visit the gardens by the bay. Go during the day time and also visit it at night time.. you don't have to pay anything unless you decide to go on the garden bridge and its only $8.,,
,,Best part of Singapore,5,,I absolutely loved the Gardens by the bay both during the day and at night for the light show. I would return to Singapore simply for the Gardens!,,
,,Wonderful attractions,5,,Brought my friends from UK and Canada to this attractions which was beyond their expectations. Made them so amazed of the wonderful places and creations. They felt at home in the domes. Thank you for an experience worth sharing and memories moments that will last for a life time!!,,
,,Gardens By The Bay,5,,"Really enjoyed my day at the bay, the evening light show (which is free if you don鈥檛 want to visit the indoor displays) is a must.

Cloud forest is spectacular, and take a walk down to satay on the bay food court, it鈥檚 delicious can recommend the BBQ Stingray.",,
,,Sakura exhibit is stunning!,5,,"The once yearly sakura exhibit is currently going on, and GBTB never fails to amaze me every year. A new addition this year would be the inclusion of japanese dolls within the flora and fauna, and special performances such as tea ceremony and the traditional Japanese drum performances outside the flower dome was a delight to bask in when you wish to rest your trigger happy hands for a bit.",,
,,Educational and Fun,4,,"A must visit for tourists. The Gardens is huge and covers several different areas. I personally prefer to explore the free area close to evening time as it would be much cooler and the lighting on the super tree is superb.

The 2 paid domes are called the flower dome and cloud dome. As the name suggests, the flower dome is decorated with different types of flowers and it is beautiful. They also have different kind of events running from time to time and they were having the Matsuri Sakura event. I was expecting more Sakura but hey at least I got to see some.

The cloud dome is a favorite. I love the waterfalls and the towering wall of plants. It is truly majestic and breath taking. This area requires a lot of climbing although there are lifts. The wait time is long though.

The domes have a very strict no food and drink inside them so when travelling with the kids, plan it so they do not go in hungry. Once entered, the paths are one way towards the exit and there are no re-entries.

The children can also visit the children's garden for some water fun.

Overall, I recommend spending half a day to fully explore the park at a slow pace.",,
,,What a great place to live the forest!,5,,"As many times that I visit Gardens by the bay, the more that I am looking for to go back and appreciate the beauty of he different trees, flowers around the world.

The peace that you find in each corner, the beautiful views and angles to take pictures and the best, to go to the top and walk down observing the plants!

You can go with families, friends and anyone really want to show how beautiful this place is.",,
,,A must visit,5,,"The gardens by the bay is definitely worth visiting. It takes more than half a day to see the Supertrees, Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. Each of these is interesting, and well laid out.",,
,,Two amazing botanical domes,4,,"Two glass domes containing a wide range of plants, trees and amazing walkways. One is an exhibition of Australian, Mediterranean, American plants, but a bit mixed up. Daffodils with summer bedding plants. The other dome is the Cloud Dome which has plants which grow high up in the cloud zone. Very cleverly displayed with a walkway winding from high up (access by lift) right down behind a waterfall.",,
,,But so cold....,5,,I was very impressed I could see cherry blossoms in Singapore.I know that low temperature is important to keep plants healthy.But it was so cold in the flower dome.It would be helpful you inform 鈥榗arry jacket or something鈥檅efore we visit.,,
,,Smooth process!,5,,"My friends and I decided last minute to enter the Flower Dome, however the queue was packed. Luckily, there is the option to buy the tickets online, so we manage to avoid the queue and bought the tickets online in less than 15 minutes. Also, we can just use the e-ticket which they sent to our email on the spot, which is very convenient for last minute plans! :)",,
,,Great experience,5,,The anime garden was a great eventful experience. Would love to go to more events held at garden by the Bay.,,
,,Fantastic Light Show!,5,,"We had an overnight stopover in Singapore and took a Viator night City Tour, Gardens by the Bay Light & Sound Show and Singapore River Experience (3 in one tour) This tour was a great way to see the highlights of Singapore in a small space of time. The Light & Sound Show was fantastic with the Marina Sands Hotel as a stunning backdrop.",,
,,Nice place,4,,Gardens by the Bay is just behind the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. Nice place with great collections of plants and greenery all around. Once can visit late morning to see the beautiful plants and be there till evening to see great lighting.,,
,,Bay stroll,4,,Another visit to Gardens at the Bay. Plenty to see and interest for everyone. Entrance to the gardens is free except for the special exhibitions and inside displays. Worth just seeing the free areas if your time is limited.,,
,,So much to enjoy!,5,,"The outdoor gardens are free allowing you to walk in lovely landscaped gardens with unusual sculptures and themed garden areas. Within the gardens are several other attractions. The Super Tree Grove with futuristic trees towering 15-20 metres above you with vertical gardens up the trunks, photovoltaic panels hidden at the top collects solar energy that goes towards the stunning light displays that take place twice nightly. You can pay to climb to the top of one and walk the high level path. Within the garden area you can also pay to visit the giant cooled conservatories of the Flower Dome and Cloud Dome, both with an amazing display of plants (reviewed separately). There are also plenty of dining options including restaurants, McDonalds and Satay By the Bay a food court of 20-30 food stalls offering meals in their Hawker style.",,
,,Superb place,5,,Took my 5 years old niece there and she loves it so much especially the supertree. This location is pretty in the afternoon and beautifull at night with millions light there.,,
,,Consistently find my transquil and refreshing moments,5,,"No regrets that I signed up for one year membership. Whether I go on sunny or cloudy days, hot and humid hours or cool and windy nites, my companions and I feel just as blissful.",,
,,Worth a look,5,,Well worth a visit especially at night. There are light shows at 7:45 and 8:45 which are set to music and very enjoyable. Many places to eat and I can strongly recommend the Chinese restaurant.,,
,,A must see.,5,,"Anyone who comes to Singapore must visit gardens by the bay. It鈥檚 an evening event and well worth it. You lie on the floor, or sit, and watch the trees light up in various colours and seem to dance around with the music.
We were there on a Saturday night and it was busy but still
Plenty of room.
Must see attraction.",,
,,Fantastic Gardens,5,,"If in Singapore do not miss the fabulous Gardens by the Bay! One can spend a whole day touring the gardens. I recommend the 15 minute audio tour to start for a good orientation. Do not miss the domes. There is a fee, but they are worth the cost and have the bonus of being cool places on a hot day. The Marina Bay Sands is just next door and an interesting way to complete the day.",,
,,Amazing !!!! Love the the Domes,5,,"Were there with my Mum & Sister when I was back to Singapore during the Chinese New Year(CNY). This is my first time there & I LOVE it. There are 2 domes : Flower & Cloud . Both are very different. Flower Dome will change it's display certain period & special event also held there. We were lucky to see the Dahlia display for CNY. Enterance tix can be purchased online or at the domes. For those who can spare tp spend the night at the bay there is light show in the bay & in Cloud dome. I love the varieties of flowers & plants around the world in the Flower Dome & the Cloud Dome has waterfall within !!! & Love the spiral walkway down the ""waterfall Mountain"". On the of the Cloud Dome are variety of Orchids can be tiny as a 5 cents coin or a large one like a palm.
Love it!!!",,
,,Just beautiful,5,,"My family and I visited Gardens by the Bay just after Chinese New Year and this place is just stunning. We arrived at 430pm and was perfect to have a stroll and look at the surroundings. We decided to have a look at the Cloud Dome and the other one (forgot the name) and highly recommend it. You pay a fee but if your children at under 3, they are for free. Caught the light show at 730pm and that was lovely. Would visit again if we come pass Singapore again :)",,
,,Stunning Gardens Amazing Views,5,,We went up on to the sky walk platform suspended by wires from steel tree like structures. Absolutely wonderful views and immaculately kept plants trees and shrubs. The high walk made my legs like jelly but with so much to see it was worth it!,,
,,Stunning collection of plants,5,,Absolutely stunning array of plants. Suggest you visit in morning get your hand stamped and return for lights show on an evening. Both Domes have a beautiful collection of plants with many wooden sculptures enhancing the beauty of the displays.,,
,,Wonderful place to have a good relaxing time,5,,"It is a trully beautiful place to spend time. We ve been with our almost 2 years doughter and the kids water area was asome.
Vegetation is luxuriant, alleys are clean, pleanty of things to see, places to relax and escape the sun's heat.
After sunset the lights are beautiful, also you can relax on grass in front of some decent restaurants.
A must see in Singapore.",,
,,Cool for a visit.,4,,"Flower dome was pretty cool, but too many selfies! Cloud forest dome was so so. But was a very enjoyable visit.",,
,,Good day out,5,,"If Disney ever do gardens this will be it! Three large areas to visit the forest zone is astonishing, make sure you have been everywhere, keep climbing!
The sky walk is okay but not worth queuing for in my opinion.
Good range of affordable caf茅s available.",,
,,Acceptable but am not impressed,3,,This is my second visit to Flower Dome and Cloud Forest..the flowers in Flower Dome seem to be aged a little and wilting in Spring ?! Just a few decorations to fit the Sakura theme but i don鈥檛 find any Sakura at all.,,
,,Quiet...Relaxing...amazing,5,,"Went to singapore on June 2017. Visited this place on an evening. Exellent atmosphere. There are several section containing different tree's around the wolrd. The most attracting thing was the super tree show. Typically there will be a big line if you want to go up stairs to watch the show. However, you can enjoy the show from ground also.",,
,,Teaching us the benefits of being green,5,,"If ever there was a great lesson about the benefits of being green and clean, this is it. Gardens by the bay showcases the beauty of plants in its many forms. I'd recommend doing the $8 audio tour on the tram first to orientate yourselves and see some of the amazing things like the two conservatories, the beautiful baby sculpture and of course the huge supertrees. The tram drops you off at the entrance to the conservatories where you can purchase or pick up pre-purchased tickets (i bought tickets on the Singapore pass).

I went to the Flower Dome first and then the Cloud Forest. Each conservatory will take you approx one hour to walk through. Both conservatories were beautiful but I found the Cloud Forest a bit more interesting as there was a lot of focus on the effects of climate change which really struck a cord with me. Be prepared for big lines in this dome.

Finally I went on the sky rail which is the platform between the supertrees. Amazing views, I recommend to go on dusk or in evening as the trees are all lit up beautifully. Worth the extra $8.",,
,,Amazing to see at night and enjoy the light show.,5,,We came here by taxi from our hotel and got in early to ensure we got a good spot right underneath the garden towers. It was quite busy and lots of people lying down on the ground. We had a little bit of a walk to get into the gardens from the road and grabbed a bit to eat in there. The food options were poor and the food to match so take snacks or eat prior. We watched the light show and enjoyed the music that accompanied it. They are all synchronised to the music and creates quite a fun and enjoyable evening out. The show lasted for about 20 mins in total and the displays had me entertained from beginning to the end. I have heard it just as spectacular in the day and exploring the towers is worth the visit but the do shut at night. Loads of fun and different to watch and be entertained by.,,
,,Slightly boring,3,,"Erm...did this as I thought we should as we were in Singapore and even more so as we were staying at the Marina Bay Sands hotel.
I was expecting more if I鈥檓 honest, it was literally just a large greenhouse with flowers It may just be us, i don鈥檛 really know what we were expecting but it just didn鈥檛 do anything for us.

The cloud dome was slightly better, although once you鈥檝e seen the waterfall that鈥檚 it.",,
,,Beautiful Gardens,4,,A nice way to spend a day looking at the gardens. You can walk around for free and only pay for entry to the glass houses but it is worth the admission charge to see the beautiful plants and flowers. Would have loved to go in the evening when everything is lit up but only had a short time to visit.,,
,,Beauty and Sustainability merged,5,,"Wonderful blend of horticulture , design, landscaping , artistry , and engineering. The large 鈥榯rees鈥?performing quad duty as solar generation, support for vines and flowers, support for a tree top walk way, and photo ops. The Cloud Forest and Flower Dome provides a unique walk through nature and a respit from the heat.",,
,,A must visit for animal lovers,5,,I did the night safari and it was great - you see some me great animals even though the tram driver doesn鈥檛 really stop for photos. I heard good things about the day safari and they saw pandas. I鈥檒l do that in my next visit.,,
,,Never gets old,5,,"I鈥檝e been to Gardens by the Bay many time and it never fails to impress me. If you have time, I recommend going once during the day and once at night for the Garden Rhapsody which runs twice at night.

Satay by the Bay is just another hawker center so I would avoid going there.",,
,,Amazing experience,5,,"Certainly worth a visit, but I would suggest splitting the day in two. In the morning head to the gardens and the domes, as it is a lot cooler with so much to see. Then head off for the remainder of the day around town. Then around dusk head back to watch the light show. Pretty much any vantage point will give you a great view. We watched from the observatory. If you want the sky walk you will need to purchase a ticket in the morning. The light show is so worth seeing.",,
,,Lovely place to spend the day.,5,,"The Gardens are my favorite place. If you like nature you can spend several hours in the Flower dome and Cloud Forest - Beware they are freezing so carry something warm.
You can end the day with the Garden Rhapsody show at 7.45 and 8.45 be sure to sit right in the Super tree grove and not by the lake side.",,
,,Truly worth the visit,5,,"Such an amazing place, the variety of plants is incredible. So much to see, I don't think we saw it all.",,
,,Top notch,5,,"My spouse and I visited Gardens by the Bay earlier this month, on a first-ever trip to Singapore. We knew in advance of the trip that Gardens by the Bay and the Supertree Grove were amongst our ""must see"" list. We were not disappointed.

We arrived in the late morning and purchased our tickets same-day. Expect to spend 2-3 hours wandering the beautiful domes. The raised walkways are extraordinary, and you will no sooner try to put your camera away than the waterfall, or the foliage, or a new flower will demand you take the camera back out. I particularly loved the way the domes are structured, to show off both the city skyscape outside and the incredible beauty inside.

Spend the money on this ticket. You won't regret it.",,
,,Beautiful place to spend with your best friends!,5,,"It is not the first time that we go to Gardens by the bay and every time that we go, we loved it more and more. I really appreciate that they are putting special events every quarter and worth it to spend an evening walking by yourself, with friends, family and see the many different types of trees and flowers around the world.",,
,,Awesome!,5,,"If you have a free time in Singapore and even if you do not, this is the place that you must visit first.
The ticket is 28 SGD to visit cloud forest and flowers. You have to add another 8 SGD for Skyway walk and it is really worth it.
To get to the gardens is very convenient by MRT. You also can get your lunch there.",,
,,Must visit attraction in Singapore!,5,,"Visited here with my family. We all loved the place. Both cloud forest and flower dome were amazing. We got tickets from the venue itself, however one can book online as well. Better to go there in evening time. They also have a light and sound show in evening that one must not miss.
In cloud dome they have something called as mist time, when they try to create amidst the clouds like experience which is worth experiencing. Also the collection at flower dome from different parts of world is amazing. Must visit place!",,
,,Outrageously spectacular,5,,An absolute must. I come and see the-super tree light show 7:45 and 8:45pm every time I come to Singapore. It鈥檚 free too. It鈥檚 an attraction for young to old. It鈥檚 cooler at night too.,,
,,Stunning gardens,5,,"Very stunning, well-maintained and structured gardens. Free entry into the main garden area which is large and easy to get around for those with mobility issues. Wide smooth paths and great signage. There is a golf cart style bus that seats around 10 people that you can buy a ticket on (cheap, around SGD$3 pp if I recall correctly) that will take you from the outside of the garden (opposite the Marina Bay Sands hotel) to the central complex. Recommend travelling through the gardens early in the morning so it is cooler and also again in the evening when the lights are up. It is like two different experiences. Definitely don't recommend walking through on a really hot day or if you are new to Singapore and not adjusted to the climate yet. We went on our first day and were having trouble adjusting to the heat and humidity. There is a nice food court inside which had good quality cheap food. Included local, western, Japanese and Indian food stalls that all looked lovely. Great service in there too.",,
,,One of the most beautiful places I've seen,5,,"This place is stunning. The gardens are beautiful and like the rest of Singapore they are immaculately kept. The cloud dome is one of the most stunning things I've seen. The dome itself is amazing but what's inside is breathtaking. A waterfall and the walkway which generates cloud is stunning.
If you are in Singapore you have to see this.",,
,,Spectacular,4,,It's beautiful and so green that you feel like in a movie surrounded by all these plants. Very convenient on a sunny day to feel a bit of fresh air. Easy to get by subway.,,
,,Worth the trip.,5,,"It is hard to believe this garden is in a city at almost 250 acres. Apparently, Singapore is considered as the garden city and this is an initiative to move to a city in the garden.

If possible purchase tickets prior to the day of tour or have your guide pre purchase the tickets. We spent about 20min in line as we had not pre purchased the tickets.",,
,,"Must visit, wish there was more info on plants",4,,It's a beautiful place. I just wished there was more information about the plants displayed. Still worthy of a visit.,,
,,Stunning Flower and Cloud Forest,5,,"I love nature and i love flowers. You can see a wide variety of flowers from all over the word, very colorful and it really amaze me.",,
,,Reclaimed land turned into a paradise,4,,"Super well organized, sparkling clean, and just plain beautiful. These gardens developed on land reclaimed from the sea are a beautiful addition to a beautiful city. Too bad that the poor air quality spoils the perfection.",,
,,Amazing,5,,"Great number of tree and good to rest from outside hotness, so many people but we enjoy the walk. Great attraction.",,
,,Very nice day and night,5,,"Went on an evening triple treat tour with RMG tours. Once again well organised , with good, heavily accented English and very little waiting. Destinations were the Gardens by night, the top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and a river cruise. The gardens were wonderful with a light show that lasted 10 minutes on these amazing Navi style structures. During this leg you can grab a quick bite to eat if you need it. You then bus to the MBS Hotel to go to the top and enjoy the view. Which was well worth it. Unfortunately you don鈥檛 get to see the infinity pool. Then we walked through the shops to our river cruise. My favourite views of this area of Singapore. Always bring water or buy it from your bus driver for a dollar.",,
,,Always something new,4,,The displays are always changing so it鈥檚 always nice to visit :) We鈥檝e visited three times in the last couple of years and each time is different. We hope to catch the tulip display someday.,,
,,Architectural marvel,5,,"This is an architectural marvel in modern Singapore, definitely worth a visit. The gardens are beautiful and well taken care of, with an amazing variety of horticulture. Be prepared to spend at least 3 hours in the domes. Highly recommended!",,
,,Big Garden in the City,5,,Big city garden worth a few visits. Impressive music with lights during the night time. Previous visit in December was cooling and make the walk much more enjoyable.,,
,,Brilliant visit,5,,"We visited in the afternoon to the conservatories and then stayed until the light show which was spectacular! - try and view the light show above the restaurants in the super tree grove. We ate at satay by the bay and had a coffee at pollen which were both very good. Satay by the bay is a small hawker centre. Use the Bayfront MRT stop not the marina bay sands.
The sky walk can be closed due to lightening risk which it was, but in the evening it opened again when it was brighter.",,
,,Stunning design,4,,"Well organised, lots to see both during the day and the laser show in the evening. The Cloud Forest was stunning, wonderful exhibit. Flower Dome was a disappointment, finding your way round was confusing and exhibits were tired looking.",,
,,Amazing,5,,"Well worth a visit! We arrived early evening just in time for the light show. Very beautiful, spacious and wonderful to see",,
,,Interesting and beautifully set out garden,5,,"We walked round these gardens several times during our five day stay in Singapore. As we were in the Marina Bay Sands hotel it was fairly easy to access the gardens.
We paid the $56 to see both greenhouses. The Cloud garden is very impressive. Unfortunately there were hundreds of school children visiting that morning so it wasn鈥檛 a very peaceful experience.
Next the Flower Garden which was more peaceful 鈥?the children hadn鈥檛 arrived. There are gardens representing all parts of the globe 鈥?lovely and very interesting. There was a display of pumpkins with a few scarecrows amongst the gorgeous floral displays.
We walked around some of the outside gardens. So beautiful and in many parts very tranquil.
We visited the gardens several times 鈥?mornings and evenings (there is a music and light display when darkness falls). It was a lovely place to get some exercise, especially after battling along Orchard Road on a Saturday morning! The canal is a great place to walk along",,
,,Amazing greenery,5,,I was so impressed with Gardens by the Bay. They harvest all the rain water needed and have solar panels to power it. The two domes are well worth visiting. Most amazing gardens i have ever seen.,,
,,Amazing Gardens,4,,"- We went to the Garden, all the adjoining areas, lake front, etc one evening and spent more than a couple of hours and it was very nice and enjoyable (we had a small kid with us) ; Visit to this garden / other areas is free. In the night we also saw the light show (this is also free ) which was also very good.

- We took the trip to cloud forest and flower dome another day as a combo and both the Flower dome and Cloud forest were fantastic.
The Flower dome is really a marvel and the cactus display in particular is excellent. This is a must visit place while at Singapore, particularly for those who love plants and gardens.
The Cloud forest is another interesting experience and was also very good.
Overall this is one among the top sights in Singapore and worth the visit.",,
,,Beautiful Huge Gardens !,4,,"The tree platform walk is worth a visit, and the gardens are surprisingly large. We used the subway system to get there which was simple, efficient and immaculately clean.
Sadly we had limited time and did not not get to see the full extent of the attraction.",,
,,"Wow, just wow.",5,,"This is spectacular and, unless you purchase tickets to specific attractions, is free. The stars of the Gardens are the trees in the Super Grove. A must do.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"Imagine a day at the park by the river and you see this amazing structures in front of you. A mixture of nature and modernity that is both amazingly beautiful. The fact that you can enjoy this park for free too suits vacation really well and on budget. Aside from that, Dragon Lake do an important part in this garden's ecosystem so it's not just built for display but to help nature maintain it's balance and beauty.",,
,,Nature Wonderland,5,,"Not difficult to spend an entire day at this amazing place. During the cooler part of the morning, adults can explore the outdoor gardens. If you are lucky you may spot some wild otters. Children can have fun at the Water play area (closed on Monday). Bring your swim wear. When it gets hot, escape to the cool areas of Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. Huge variety of flowers at Flower Dome. Many opportunities for great photos. At 7.45pm & 8.45pm, don't miss the magical Light & Sound show.",,
,,Stunning,5,,"Definitely a must-see in Singapore, the Gardens by the Bay are impressive. Great care has gone into the design and range of exhibits.",,
,,Nothing extraordinary,3,,Frankly the giant trees did not seem extraordinary to me. The garden is beautiful as a whole. But i would not consider this as a top attraction of Singapore.,,
,,A must.,5,,"Easy to stroll around, good on a rainy day as enclosed. Good variety of plants and amazing ! We had 2 hours here and lots of seats to relax. Not expensive and good times.",,
,,Great day,5,,We loved gardens by the bay. Spent the whole day there and still didn鈥檛 get to see everything. Will definitely be back again,,
,,Fabulous by day and night.,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is absolutely stunning and more amazing is free to enter. All the grounds are immaculately kept with stunning displays. There is plenty of space despite the obvious number of visitors, it didn't feel crowded at all. The National Orchid garden is part of the site where there is an entrance fee but this is well worth it, so many varieties and exciting displays. Make sure you take bottled water with you as walking around such a large area in very humid conditions takes its toll. The ""super trees"", man made structures are fabulous by day but at night are illuminated to music which when viewed from the viewing deck at the Marina Bay Sands Skypark are quite spectacular. There is also a high walkway around the trees which is short but give good views.",,
,,Unexpected and breathtaking,5,,"Our final night of the Microsoft Global Educator Exchange was held at Flower Field Hall at Gardens by the Bay. It was scheduled to start at 7, but my colleague and I came early to go to the Cloud Forest also. I wish we would have had more time, because we missed out on walking on the Super Grove before it closed. I was very impressed with everything I saw. The hall was a great venue with access to the indoor gardens with a special exhibit of Japanese gardens in the spring. I was just in Japan in October, so it was fun to see recreations. The building itself is interesting and has a wonderful view of the bay. Don鈥檛 miss this when you鈥檙e in Singapore and give yourself more time to explore. Also, I鈥檓 not usually one for gift shops, but there were a lot of unique and interesting, quality items and worth looking in. The rooftop bar in the Super Grove is worth the admission to go up there. We went at night and the view was stunning. You don鈥檛 have to get alcohol, there were plenty of non-alcoholic options also. Since we missed out walking around the walkway connecting the Super Grove, at least we got to go in one and see the view. I was also disappointed I missed the light show, I heard it was amazing.",,
,,Beautiful Gardens.,5,,"The Gardens by the Bay is amazing, there is so much to see. the architecture is fantastic. The gardens are really well kept, we loved walking through it. We saw the Otters too which was a great bonus. there are cycle paths and pedestrian walkways. There is a gift shop,Toilets and cafes too.",,
,,Fabulous views,5,,"Will have to return to Singapore just to see more of this fantastic place. Surprised we had to pay to access the skywalk but as admission to the Gardens is free not a real problem
Food at cafe really good
Had to visit during the day but it appears that night time is even better",,
,,amazing botanical gardens,5,,Gardens by the Bay is by far the most beautiful and complete botanical garden i have ever experienced! must see: the cloud forest and the flower hall.,,
,,Night show,5,,"Watched the light show from our balcony in the marina bay sands ..... then went down into the gardens to see them close up.
Just amazing ..... one of the highlights of our visit to Singapore this time around.
Am definitely going to have a day reserved to go through the grounds during the day on our next visit.",,
,,Not to be missed,5,,A full day would do justice to this place.We did cloud forest and flower dome as a combo but skip the flower dome.Entry to garden is free.And the night light show at 0730 and 0830 is spectacular.If I had more days I would have visited this place again.,,
,,Highly recommended,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is one of the main tourist attractions in Singapore and rightly so. I highly recommend visiting this place.
Large vitality of plants, some things I've never seen before.
The waterfall is quite surreal.
Organization is superb, no waiting.
We spent about hour and a half. Inside, it is nice and cool, not humid like some videos may indicate.
Overall, superb.

Cheers",,
,,Breathtaking indoor gardens,5,,This is a pinnacle of.engineerimg and art. Breathtakingly beautiful and educational at the same time. Thoroughly enjoyable for the whole family - highly recommended!!,,
,,Just beautiful,5,,Our visit to Gardens by the Bay was truly one of the best experiences we had in Singapore. Highly recommend to new or even regular visitors to Singapore.,,
,,A massive Garden - Green all around. A serious Masterpiece,4,,"Its a true Masterpiece.
Its got Garden, Flowers, decorations, Trees - all inside an Air Conditioned building. 
You will be mesmerized to see the big trees, lovely flowers and greenery all Around. 
There is a lovely Waterfall - when you enter the Cloud Garden. 

I am impressed by the way they have decorated the entire Garden and maintained it. ",,
,,An amazing garden well worth seeing.,5,,"We went to the Gardens and were very impressed with the beauty of this attraction. I jts wish we could have gone there at night, as we were told it is even more stunning at night. I would definitely recommend this site.",,
,,Gardens by the bay,5,,"Enjoyed a day at the gardens. Very pretty, especially the cloud dome. Easy to get around and worth a visit.",,
,,Great - but not my cup of tea,4,,It is great to watch the garden from Singapore Flyer and relish it from Skypark but it was not a great experience for me personally. The light and music show during night was great. Located very close to Marina Bay Sands.,,
,,Thousands of flowers and plants in one roof,5,,The place is worth visiting. Experience all beautiful flowers plants in one area. Rare flowers and plants is also available and the building is air conditioned. nice to go there during day time to avoid the hot temperature of Singapore,,
,,Night time stunning!,5,,"Well apart from feeling quite safe walking around at night, its worth the atmosphere just being here at dark. The Park is vast, but worth a wander around to walk off those amazing food bellys!
We lay down underneath the supertrees and watched them change lights and just listened to the quietness. The lights of the Marina Tower in the back ground and the city is worth a look at night for sure The cloud Garden is only open till 08.30 so be aware of that.
Security is present.",,
,,1st time to Singapore,5,,Awesome gardens. Photographer's dream. Flower dome and Cloud dome are lovely and cool. Supertrees look amazing. Unfortunately didn't get to see light show at night nut will do next time.,,
,,Beautiful,5,,Lots of activity. Beautiful gardens with amazing plants and architecture. Do not miss. Plenty of restaurants and entertainment nearby.,,
,,Lovely gardens,5,,You will need three hours to cover it all at a quick tempo. It truly is magnificent. Many signs explaining about the plants and trees. Some is free but if you wish to go inside the globe you will need to pay.,,
,,Just beautiful and exhilarating experience,5,,While in Singapore one should never miss this beautiful place. Easily approachable location. The garden is so exquisitely arranged and planned and everything is a treat to watch. Flower plants from across the world and the time spent there one gets so much peace and tranquility,,
,,Amazing,5,,An amazing area. Probably the highlight of our holiday. Fantastic light show. A fantastic ecological project brilliantly executed.,,
,,Magical place,5,,"I got tickets to go see the Flower Conservatory and the Super Trees. The flower conservatory was a disappointment since the flowers were nothing really unique to Singapore.

The Super Trees during the lightshow are amazing. It is recommended to purchase tickets in advance to go up the walkway which are 20m above the ground. Though they look amazing from the ground - it is even more spectacular from above with open views to Marina Sands and skyline.

Definitely worth a visit!",,
,,Amazing place!,5,,"We spent 4 hours here, taking a taxi and arriving just after 9 am, the best thing we did as there were no queues. We did the skywalk first before it got too hot, then went into the conservatories, which were amazing, and also did the high walk in there as well. Such an amazing place, and the cafe inside the flower conservatory was very good for a latte! We then revisited here in the evening in a tour from our hotel. The light show was truly amazing, lasting 15 minutes and we got some excellent Video and photos, along with stiff necks. If you do nothing else, then you must visit here!",,
,,"Gardens by the Bay needs more than the traditional 2 or 3 hours for a visit, and needs multiple visits.",5,,"Gardens by the Bay is a totally new addition to Singapore in the last 10 years. We were absolutely amazed not only at the growth, but at the quality of the additions of attractions. Gardens by the Bay tops the list of Singapore attractions, and requires more than 2-30 hours to truly appreciate it. We started with the traditional photo ops of Marina Bay with Merlion and the Arts and sciences Museum, then spent time at the 3 towers of Marina Bay Sands and the ""Shoppes"" Mall, but ended up at Gardens of the Bay, its' Supergrove Trees and the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest area. Breathtaking, do not miss the skywalk experience, and take time to take photos of the sculptures, the plants and trees of the different gardens. Then come back, and back again to see what you missed on your last trip. We can only say ""Wow!"".",,
,,Water play is a great activity for kids,4,,"The water park is a wonderful, free activity for kids. A larger play area with water jets works well for older, more active kids while a smaller, toddler area is excellent for younger kids who like to explore. Shaded trail paths surround the water park with obstacles and other challenges for kids to test themselves.

There is a small, covered amphitheater where parents and grandparents tend to gather out of the sun to keep an eye on the kids.

The water park area also has good shower and changing facilities so plan accordingly. If you have younger kids I鈥檇 recommend paying the nominal fee and take the golf cart shuttle from the MRT entrance. It will save you a good 15 minute walk.",,
,,Awesome light and music show,5,,One of the must see spots while in Singapore. Get their early to get a good spot to see the trees light up and listen to the music.,,
,,beautiful....,5,,"Great place to go for an afternoon, get in the shuttle to take a tour around which also offers a audio guide.",,
,,Flower Dome,5,,The entire presentation is something to be seen.The variety of plants and the layout with balanced statues is really good,,
,,amazing park,5,,took the tram tour around the park. about 20 minutes of an escorted and highlighted tour. well worth the $8 charge.,,
,,Proud innovations of Singapore,5,,Loved 猫 drome two wonderful garden to explore 猫 difference of quality indoor plants n outdoor plants as well as flowers. 脠 new advance technology in modern plantation n greener cooler pastures scenery instead of concrete wall.,,
,,An Absolute Bucket List Must Do,5,,"WOW! Just Wow. We loved this place. I can't believe anyone visits Singapore and doesn't make time to come here. For me, this was our Number 1 attraction and we spent 8 days in Singapore and did a lot. Hands down fabulous place. Flower Dome, Cloud Forest and the Superdome Trees with their suspension bridge and light show at night. Don't hesitate to visit.",,
,,Beautiful day,5,,"What a beautiful place to walk around!
Very well organised you can walk, ride, shuttle or self drive around.
Worth a look!! The cloud garden was amazing.
Easy to catch the escalator back up to MBS to enjoy a cocktail in the bar upstairs.
Easy to catch the MRT directly underneath to head back into the city.",,
,,wow,5,,"Easy walking throughout, plenty of restaurants and parks along the way. The gardens were brilliant, the technology was in evidence. You can see that the Singaporeans take great pride in their city. So much to see and do and experience, fabulous for families too.",,
,,Incredible show,5,,"Going there from the hotel is easy using the bridge.
Light show and sound animation creates a unique atmosphere, you need to experience! A visit during day must be also super seeing the statues and the plants. There is also a botanical garden under a ceiling...",,
,,Amazing Day Out,5,,This is a must. Amazing works of art placed among wonderful gardens. A very Zen place. I felt totally relaxed after my visit.,,
,,Gardens by the Bay Singapore is a must see experience,5,,Make sure you allocate at least a half or preferably a full day to experience one of the worlds best man made Garden displays. The Super Tree Grove night show is also a must to see. This is well worth your entrance fee.,,
,,The best place to visit,5,,"Need a day or maybe more to explore the garden and also a good exercise too. From exploring the garden with its different thematic garden to climbing the super tree grove, walking around in flower dome and mesmerizing yourself in cloud forest. You can get back in the evening for beautiful light shows. Check the weather if you have a plan to go there. They won鈥檛 allow you to climb super tree grove while raining. Tired? Take a buggy car or a shuttle to go around the park.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay at Singapore,4,,"Very good place to spend time..You will need about 4-5 hours for the entire stretch including Clouds of forest dome, Flower dome, and then on to the lovely lighting displays at 7.45pm and 8.45 pm of the Supertrees! However watch out that the shuttle to Bayfront MRT closes at 9pm..and you may have to walk it down.. But it is worth the enjoyment..",,
,,Great to visit Day & Night,4,,"We visited the Gardens by the Bay during the day and at night. The only disappointing part was when we visited both times, the skywalk was closed due to weather (though the weather seemed fine). Be prepared for large crowds at the night light show.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,Gardens By the Bay Is Beautiful! It reminds me of Avatar. I'd totally come back here! So many photo opportunities!,,
,,What a fantastic place,5,,"So much to see here - free to get in, then you pay for specific attractions, such as the tree walk, the greenhouses etc. Spent ages here and got some great photos of the huge metal trees.",,
,,What a feast,5,,"Singapore has done really well with this beautiful gardens. Especially, with both domes inside the park (a must see!). Standing below the superstrees gives you a feeling of being in the Avatar movie. Stay a little longer at night and you will see why so many people appreciate this park!",,
,,Definately need to go !!!,5,,"When we decided to go to Singapore, many people recommend Garden by the Bay. The last time I had been to Singapore, it was not there yet so I was excited to visit the garden.

Garden by the Bay is definitely not your ordinary garden but a futuristic wonder that seems to be beamed down from space and might just be the best tourist attraction in Singapore.

It is Singapore鈥檚 largest garden spanning a total of 101 hectares of prime land right beside the spectacular Marina Bay. It is a part of Singapore鈥檚 vision of becoming a 鈥淐ity in a Garden鈥?",,
,,Simply Lovely,5,,Visit during the day and pay the 28 Singapore dollars to visit the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome. Make sure you are still there for the evening Super Trees light show - stunning.,,
,,Well worth the visit,4,,"Take a day to get the most out of this attraction, stroll around the outside and see the different areas set out. Wonderfully set out and many spectacular sites and plants. Sculpture areas designed to give special effects. The tall trees and walkways to follow. The greenhouses you pay to enter but well worth the price. If you have walking difficulties then take the golf buggy ride, last for 20 mins takes you all round the park for $6. We did not visit this time in the evening but are back later in the year and plan to go again to see the lights.",,
,,Honeymoon perfection,5,,Love love love! We visited twice and took in the light show aswell as the skywalk and the cloud walk. We meandered through a lot of the gardens also. A really special place completely worth the journey.,,
,,One of the best attractions in Singapore,5,,"It's always great to spend some hours in the cool app that access of the flower some and the cloud forest. Modern architecture meets plant life. Buy the tickets online or through a travel agent, and you may save significantly.",,
,,Amazing gardens,5,,"It鈥檚 free! You can walk around the metal trees, wander along bayside walks. Great children鈥檚 garden with wet area, but you absolutely MUST pat to see the huge Glass houses. One of the most spectacular pieces of architecture with stunning views from inside to out!",,
,,A different and beautiful park,5,,It鈥檚 hot during the day. Prefer afternoon or evening. You can watch light show at the huge trees towards 8pm. Do not skip cloud falls as well.,,
,,you will want to go back again,5,,3rd visit - and we went twice this time. There is so much to take in- the cloud forest is spectacular and I AM NOT ONE FOR GARDENS. But the displays are stunning 拢15 admission to the two domes is well worth it - you can easily spend a day at the gardens and not see everything. Thence the need to go back,,
,,Visit to the gardens,1,,"This is a must for a night visit - stunning views and beautiful when lit up, we entered via Marina Bay Hotel which is another mush see",,
,,worthwhile,4,,pretty nice garden area near marina bay gardens. worth visiting for a quick afternoon visit if youre in the area,,
,,Definitely #1 attraction in Singapore,4,,"To see the big trees is free, although you do have to pay 3 SGD for a shuttle to take you to the cloud forest and flower dome nearby. This should be free. You do have the option to walk for free obviously, so I chose this option. It is worth visiting the place during the day and also another day at night, very different scenery. At night there is music and the trees change colors. During the day, absolutely recommend doing the cloud forest and flower dome, at the place it is $28 but you can find online for cheaper paid $23 for both. Overall great experience",,
,,Brilliant a must do in Singapore !!,5,,"It was jaw droppingly brilliant and time very well spent and even better it was air conditioned for both the main exhibit areas
Great value for money , we sprint a couple of hours but you could spend all day and still not see everything in detail
This is a must do !!",,
,,A must place to go in Singapore,5,,Easy to get to by Taxi. Great attractions with a site open side tour bus and covered domes (The Cloud Forest is spectacular). After or before visiting get a Bum Boat around the bay - Drops off/picks up outside the Marina Bay shopping/hotel complex,,
,,Really cool show,4,,"I didn't really want to go at first because I thought you could only go if you paid and it was a bit expensive, but I found out we could still go and enjoy the show that happens every evening at 6pm and it was really worth it! A lot of people but the lights, the mood, the music... A very nice experience!",,
,,Best treasure of Singapore !,5,,We visited this place in the evening. I find this time the best time to visit this place. Sun was setting and Singapore started lighting up. Wonderful experience. We crossed through bridge inside Marina Bay Sands to the other side to watch musical fountain show. Singapore Merlion is worth visiting. River Cruise was wonderful. Unforgettable night.,,
,,A must see.,5,,"We only saw them at night for the light show, a must see. Due to time restrictions and temperatures we didn鈥檛 go in the daytime, but we would if we came again.",,
,,Botanical overload,5,,Never before have we been so impressed with a man made garden. The variety of the species in the Flower Dome was amazing. Attention to detail was everywhere with a springtime flowering all the year round. They were even lowering the temperature to try to make the Japanese Cherry Blossom tree bloom.,,
,,Awesome place,5,,We really loved it here. Beautiful place to spend the day taking great photos and enjoying the fresh air. It's really worth the visit.,,
,,Stunning Gardens!,5,,"Absolutely amazing gardens and a must see for any visitor or traveller to Singapore. See the gardens during the day, as well as watch the sound and light show at night. There are shows at 7.45 pm and 8.45 pm every night.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay Splender,5,,"This place is a masterpiece, I loved the way the gardens cloaked you, and protected you from the older city elements, you could be anywhere walking around this place. We will always remember our time in Gardens by the Bay, our memories are pleasant for sure, and perhaps we will come back again.",,
,,Nice Gardens,5,,"Great trip here. Lovely walk. Both domes are well worth visiting, as is the tree top walk. Very safe, great day here",,
,,Spectacular Show at Night.,5,,"We took a Grab taxi from our cruise ship to the Gardens in the early evening to witness the spectacular sound and light show and we were not disappointed. There were long waits for the Cloud Walk so we didn't bother; we took the advice of the helpful man on the information desk near the entrance and just went in for no charge. We found a place to sit and were treated to the amazing show.

Afterwards we walked to the MRT station in large crowds, through the atrium of the Marina Bay Sands, and took the train back to the port. Sure, a lot of walking, but we soon got our train. We didn't get to see inside the huge domes, but will save that for when we return, as we fully intend to do.",,
,,Divine,5,,"Never have I witnessed so much beautiful, lush vegetation further enhanced with lights... a night visit is a must.",,
,,A great place to spend time with family,5,,"Garden by the Bay is probably the most beautifully designed garden I have ever visited. Everything was fully designed with theme and technology. And the best part is: the outdoor garden is free.

There's a garden and playground for the children as well where it has a water features to play with.

So many great spots to take pictures. And everything was well maintained.

Good job Singapore!",,
,,Unbelievable sight,5,,"This gorgeous man-made wonder located behind the iconic Marina Bay Sands Hotel is a must visit especially for first timers! I am not normally a huge fan of botany, yet this place provided such magical and wondrous journey of nature intermixed with modern design and architecture that it ended up being one of the highlights of our Singapore trip! This place - which is easily accessible from the hotel - is not cheap, but really worth the admission fee for the hours you can spend exploring all the range of plants and flowers and for the cool relief from the typical humid and hot Singapore weather. Would highly recommend!",,
,,Worth to visit,5,,"Very interesting, can spend the whole day here. The garden is awesome. After visit this place, we can walk to Marina Barrage in less than 15 mins then come back to see the light show at 19:45.",,
,,Incredible,5,,"What an amazing place, you can not miss this!! I'm actually lost for words thinking about it, 馃槉 incredible, beautiful, impressive, awe-inspiring, you have to experience the cloud dome for yourself to understand!",,
,,"Superb location, easy to access. Friendly staff and lots of choices for eating nearby. Kids will love it too.",5,,Excellent for locals and tourists alike. Brilliantly set out and lots to see and do. Both indoor and outdoor locations to visit. Plenty of unusual plants and trees. Very well done.,,
,,Fabulous,5,,Spent 4 hours here looking at the gardens and two domes - could have easily spent longer - very beautiful,,
,,Hate crowds? Go early morning,5,,"So. Many. Tourists.
I went on a Saturday night and was amazed by the crowds! It鈥檚 worse than a mall on Christmas Eve Then went back the next morning at 8am and was so peaceful and had the place to myself to indulge in the sights to see. Tour buses started arriving from 9am onwards.
The MRT station is right there, easy to get to :)",,
,,Normal Place,3,,It is a normal place .. you can only enjoy the flowers view and the cold weather generated by the Air Conditioners.. you can visit it if you have a free time in your trip .. not worth spending the whole day there,,
,,Something for everyone,5,,"If you鈥檙e not a garden lover then this is the garden for you. If you love gardens then you will enjoy this. The gardens offer so much variety that you can take a friend who doesn鈥檛 really enjoy gardens and they will appreciate the technology, structures etc that make this place work.",,
,,Amazing,5,,Wow! Totally blown away by this amazing place. Absaloutley loved all of it and the cloud garden was spectacular. This was the reason we came to Singapore and we are so glad we did. Fabulous.,,
,,A great day out - don't expect to see everything in an hour or two !,5,,"Surprisingly this was an excellent day out. I was a little sure what to expect of a park, but there is so much to see and do there. The Skywalk was pretty amazing and the 2 themed attractions of the forest and botanical gardens were amazing. In all we spent a good morning and afternoon in the gardens before heading over to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and heading up to the roof terrace.",,
,,"Main gardens free, including music and light show",5,,"Could not believe this attraction was free to walk around the gardens taking lots of pictures. The only charges are to enter the two domes, again well worthwhile if you have a head for heights. Some of the wooden root carvings are absolutely fantastic. In the evening, the music and lights begins at 7.45pm, lasting about 15 minutes, but there are a lot of people and many pick their spot to sit, and eventually lie down, beneath the towers to watch the display from around 6.30pm.",,
,,Beautiful Cloud forest,4,,During our visit flower dome was shut down due to monthly maintenance but cloud forest was open. The waterfall in cloud forest was amazing. It has some really beautiful flowers as well. The garden was awesome. We find it really amazing and different.,,
,,Amazing light show,5,,The gardens are always worth a visit in spite of the crowds but it is worth going after dark to see the light show in Supertree Grove. It's a firework display without fire or smoke!,,
,,Wow,5,,"Amazing plant life here, they even have a whole baobab trees inside, well worth the visit if you have an hour to kill.",,
,,Superb day or night,5,,"This should be your first stop once in Singapore. It's like you are in a scene of avatar. Interesting, well done expositions, breezy as it's by the water. Just fabulous for all ages",,
,,The best of Singapore,5,,Strongly suggest visiting the cloud forest and waiting for a free light show under the super trees. It was really amazing.,,
,,Prepare to Cherry Blossom display,5,,"I disaapointed because i came to flower dome when they change to cherry blossom display. I cant to see the flowers. But, in this play, you will see many beautiful flower. Very recommended for nature enthusiast.",,
,,Another must visit in Singapore,4,,"Is a must see in Singapore, however it is at its best if you see it at night! simple as that. We went on a Saturday afternoon and it was great. They do a ""Grove tree rhapsody"" at 19:45 which I strongly recommend. It's basically a light and music show using the lights of the trees. I am aware the description sounds a bit ""oh another touristic thing"" but is pretty impressive and most importantly is free! I recommend 1)taking some drinks with you since we found all the stands quite pricy in that area. 2) got to the grass area and watch the show from there. The grass is super clean as is very relaxing to be there laying on on it while watching this impressive show.",,
,,Singapore鈥檚 Best,5,,"If there鈥檚 one place I never miss whenever I鈥檓 in Singapore, it鈥檚 the Garden By The Bay. It鈥檚 nature and humanity harmoniously and creatively put together! I always go back to the domes and the super trees. You can spend two full days there and still leave awed by its magnificence. There are enough good restaurants around to satisfy any budget.",,
,,Nature and technology displayed in splendor,5,,"This was an amazing feat to witness, especially the ""Cloud Forest"". Both domes and surrounding gardens are beautiful, and the night show worth seeing.",,
,,In a flowery green world,5,,"Gardens by the bay .
Two beautiful attractions.
Cloud Forest & Flower dome.
Both an architectural marvel & housing beautiful plants on the other side .
Cloud Forest houses a very big man made waterfall, may be the largest man made artificial water fall in the world . Multitudes of plants & flowers & fruit trees .
Spare few hours for the gardens by the bay , preferably one full day if you are a nature lover.
A nice place to have a family picnic .",,
,,No access to either of the Domes,1,,"Extremely disappointing. One of the domes was closed for a private function, and the other was closed due to maintenance! Not great planning huh?",,
,,Loved it!,5,,"We bought a deal from Klook for entry to the flower dome and cloud forest. Both of which were cool, however I recommend spending more time in the cloud forest over the flower dome.

The supergrove trees really are a sight to see. You kind of don鈥檛 realise how massive they are until you鈥檙e standing underneath them. Worth seeing them both during the day and at night for the light show.",,
,,Evergreen gardens,5,,"Gardens by the bay give a very welcoming atmosphere, it a place where you finds good rest of body and mind... it's a place to be in summer time.",,
,,Just beautiful,5,,You can easily spend most of a day here exploring all of the gardens. Located just outside the Marina Bay Sands hotel so plenty of places to eat,,
,,Surreal Oasis for Plant and Design Lovers!,5,,Perfectly situated if you are especially staying at Marina Bay Sands! The design and various cultural inclusions are very inspirational! Very well suited for time with family and children! (traveled September 2014),,
,,Unbelievable,5,,"Just fantastic, could have spent a lot more time there, but what we did see was just unbelievable, it is an absolute must see if in Singapore. It was just so hard to comprehend the enormousness of this mind boggling structures and gardens. Just hoping that we get the chance to see the ""gardens By the Bay"" again William & Lesley Perth",,
,,Well worth seeing!,5,,We took a taxi to the Gardens by the Bay which was so quick and easy for us rather than walking from the railway station in the heat. The flower domes are really magnificent and the little bus that takes you on a tour of the whole gardens is well worth doing if you don't want to walk in the heat.,,
,,Breathtaking!!! A masterpiece of Gardening and Architecture!!!,5,,"There are not enough superlatives to describe the experience of visiting Gardens by the Bay whether it be during the day or to experience the evening light show.

By day it such a joy to wander around the gardens abundant with both local and overseas varieties of flowers and plants in both the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. You cannot help but be amazed at the visionary who created this oasis and then by the skill and ability of the many architects, builders, landscapers and botanists who brought it to life.

No visit would be complete though without staying to watch the evening laser show where the Supertree Grove comes to light in a myriad of changing colours.Absolutely breathtaking!!!",,
,,Wow,5,,This was the the highlight of our trip. The anticipation was not a disappointment. The domes were amazing. Unfortunately the weather was against us so we couldn鈥檛 fully enjoy the gardens. However the light show was amazing. This is a must see whilst in Singapore.,,
,,Beautiful and unique,5,,"It is an example of efficient, cleanliess and beauty. For 8 dolars you can take a lift and walk between the iconic threes. There are also some places to buy snacks in there and there are also clean toilets .",,
,,One of the greats,5,,"Only open for 7 years this is one of the worlds greatest gardens. In part set up to take some pressure off arguably one of the greatest botanical gardens in the world, SBG, it is now drawing mega crowds as well. One of the reasons is a great horticulturalist from Queensland Anton van der Schan.
Must see in SG.",,
,,Out of the world,5,,"This was the fourt day of our visit and we took a bus from our hotel to reach marina bay sands.
Inorder to reach gardens by the bay we had to go to marina bay sands.
Inside marina bay sands( Tower 2) we took a lift till 6th floor and from there we had to cross a pavement to reach gardens by the bay.
Entry to the gardens is free but you will have to pay S$ 23 if you have to go inside the two domes.
If you are a real fan of flora and faunas then this place is the best place for you.
This place is highly recommended to go during night as the place look Un-earthly during night because of the light shows and the beauty of the garden.",,
,,Amazing park,5,,Garden by the bay is big park near the marina bay u can see cloud forest and flower dome .very nice and amazing .there is some resturant u can eat,,
,,I could go here everyday!,5,,"I loved this, a gardener at heart but there was so much to look at. The flower dome was stunning.I was amazed at the beauty and how well maintained it was. It didn鈥檛 seem to matter how many people were there as it was peaceful and you could wander around at your own pace.
The cloud dome was equally beautiful, it was great to walk through and there is just so much to look at!

The only disappointing thing was the family who were putting their hands through the fence panels to try and take the coins that people had thrown into the crystals for good luck.

If my children hadn鈥檛 been so tired I would have stayed longer.

A must see, and congratulations to Singapore for investing in such an iconic piece of sustainable environmental art",,
,,Unbelievable,5,,"It was amazing! I felt like in a fairy tale! I would come again and take my family with me next time! The lights, music, ideas of architect- it is just something unbelievable!
It is very clean on the streets, the cleanest city in Asia, I would say.",,
,,Must visit place in Spore,5,,"it's one of the top must visit place in Spore. could easy to reach here by walking from Marina bay or by MRT.
you could visit 2 dorms with some fares, or just go around outside the dorms.
Such a really good experience with fresh air, trees, flower and nature when you wandering around.",,
,,Mind blown,5,,This is so beautiful and interesting I love being surrounded by nature so this was one of my favourite things. The light show was so cool to see and the sky trees just amazed me. Can鈥檛 wait to visit again,,
,,Wonderful but needs to spend time and poor sign board,4,,Took my supplier and my manager to check out this #1 attraction and went there in early evening to beat the heat. Quite hard to find even we know roughly the location since one knows it is Marina but the signs are poor and it took us some time to find it with our GPS. Anyway many other visitors have same idea and end up long Q even in the evening...,,
,,Wow,5,,"Must see attraction, very creative, worth paying to go into the cloud dome. I'd avoid weekends, it was incredibly busy with locals and tourists. Great variety of orchids. Lots of walking, wear comfortable shoes.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"Beautiful design, both domes are fabulous and the tree-show is beyond spectacular. Truly great for all ages! Not to be missed!",,
,,A Unique Place,5,,"As much as I recollect the memories of my Singapore trip, Garden By the Bay stands out to be one of the most unique experience. Some tips which I wish I had known before going -

1. The place is huge and you can actually spend good 7-8 hours if u see it properly.

2. The two main attractions are the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest you must spend the maximum time there. Spending time in the evening in seeing the 2 is advisable.

3. Super tree Grove once lit up are majestic

4. Advisable to take the tickets in advance through package to save on cost and qu茅.

5. There are wheel chair and buses facilities available of you are traveling with kids or senior citizens

6. Pick a map at the entrance to not lose way.

The place is one of its kind in terms of preservation of environment. Had a great time and would recommend to anyone who visits singapore.",,
,,"Worth Finding the time, even if it's just for the night.",5,,"Worth Finding the time, even if it's just for the night to see the Laser Light Show. We arrived after 7pm and didn't leave until 11pm and still didn't see it all.",,
,,"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!",5,,"The Cloud Dome was magnificent and the Flower Dome had some amazing plants, including a grove of olive trees that have to be hundreds of years old. The nightly light show was cool - bring a rug to sit on and find a place where you can see the three main trees. This garden is a tribute to Singapore's environmental planning.",,
,,Beautiful gardens,4,,"This is definitely a place for the garden lover. It's well designed with many different types of plants and flowers from around the world. One nice thing about this place is that much of the space is free to visit; you only pay if you go into the domes or on the walkway. The domes are well worth the price. If you are able, come for the light show at 7:45pm in the supertree area.",,
,,Very Good Displays.,4,,"Of the two domes we both preferred the Cloud Forest to the Flower Dome.

The Flower Done contains many plants and flowers that we are accustomed to seeing in the UK and Europe and in most people's gardens.

The Cloud Forest has more exotic plants, shrubs and trees and the layout is a more spectacular. The walk down from the top of the tower to the ground through the various levels and plants is very good.

Tickets for both domes can be purchased as one single ticket which for Seniors was S$26.",,
,,A beautiful experience!,5,,It is definitely worth a visit by day as well as by night. The night view of the trees and their light show is beautiful.,,
,,Stunning attraction with a fascinating variety of gardens and information.,5,,We visited twice: first visit by taxi and we did a guided tour and later we returned by MRT and did a lot of walking. It is good to break up the walking with time in the cooler Flower Dome and later the Cloud Forest. Both well worth visiting. There was concession for seniors and again for people who had Singapore airlines boarding pass. Good variety of places to eat.,,
,,Breathtaking,5,,"Walked in the Gardens by the Bay in the early morning, with a great sunrise and then late at night.

In the early morning, it was busy with joggers and cyclists. The highlight was seeing a family of otters!

However, by far, the evening walk through the Gardens was breathtaking!!!

Can't wait to come back with the family and explore more fully!!",,
,,One of the best places in Singapore,5,,Take your time to visit the gardens by the bay. The garden is very big so take a day to go around and enjoy the place. It is worth.,,
,,I adore gardens!,5,,"My review is probably bias only because I adore gardens and nature. Gardens by the Bay is, as the other gardens in Singapore, immaculate, exquisite, incredibly gorgeous, awe-inspiring, very safe, peaceful, quiet with gracious staff.",,
,,One of a kind wonder,5,,"Entrance to this wonderful and magic place is free, but you have to pay a fee og 8 AS if you want to do the sky-walk. Be there at night - when the Threes Gets illuminated around 1900 - and the music make this an enchanted evening. This is a man made must see - AS the Eiffel Tower, the Sydney opera house, Big Ben and Empire State Building",,
,,Fantastic place to visit,5,,"This was such a fantastic experience though we could definitely have had more time to explore. I'd allow at least half a day to have a good look around everything in the gardens. The only downside was the food, there weren't many great eating options.",,
,,Magical place,5,,"Visiting this place is a must. Easy to get to via the Singapore MTR. Free to get in but if you can afford it, also go into the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest as they are both amazing. Book discounted tickets online beforehand to save money. Get your hand stamped when you leave so that you can re-enter later if you want to. Plan your visit so that you watch the Supertree light and sound show after dark. Food isn鈥檛 cheap to buy so take a packed lunch with you.",,
,,Amazing show at night!,5,,You should start your trip at the afternoon for catching a breath-taking music performance in the evening. This natural park is a must-to-see park you should not ignore whenever coming to singapore!!!,,
,,Must go!,5,,Amazing and beautiful place and must go. I liked both of the gardens. It's a bit pricey but totally worth it.,,
,,Beautiful Garden,5,,"Beautiful garden in a vast area. Many kind of plantations here. Any types of transportation can take you there; buses, mrt, taxies, and cars. You can visit this garden for free except for Cloud Forest, Flower Dome, and OCBC Skywalk.",,
,,Just amazing,5,,We visited five years ago and today it was a pleasure to see how much it had developed. I only pray that other authorities and governments and councils around the planet would adopt the same approach to make the imbeciles who are wrecking our planet understand what jeopardy they are putting our children and grand children in. This place is a wonder and truly spectacular.,,
,,"Huge busy park, a must see",4,,"Spent a few hours there, exceptionally busy but lots to see and enjoy.. Easy to get to, especially if you have the Singapore Air card as we did. Poor weather during our visit probably played a major part in the apparent crowding",,
,,Simply the Best,5,,Awesome sculptures housing plants from all over the world displays for Chinese New Year were sensational wonderful cacti and succulents growing in the dome and outside wooden animal sculptures pop out here and there Manmade tree sculptures adorned with Tillandsias and Bromelaids we enjoyed a Light show at around 7.30 at night will be back,,
,,Jean Linda Carol,5,,Stunning place to visit - the flower dome and cloud forest were interesting and informative. By far the best is the nightly light show under the super trees which is absolutely amazing - and free. A must for any visit to Singapore.,,
,,Stunning experience,5,,"Beautifully and efficiently presented exhibition of plants in a natural setting, amazing displays of colour and variety. Thought provoking information information of pollution dangers to the planet",,
,,Never Miss this place...!!,5,,"One of the best place to visit in SIngapore. Try this place in th evening spent you time in the adjacent gardens which your kids love.. Take you tickets to Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. The best way to explore this wonderful space is to get a Combo ticket which gets you entry to Gardens, Cloud forest , Flower dome and nearby SKYPARK observation deck at the famed Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Try not to miss out the illumination at 7PM",,
,,Good if you are interested in plants,3,,"... otherwise, give the flower dome a miss. Cloud dome a bit more interesting. Free gardens worth a wander. Skyway closed as rain was forecast, looked very limited to us.",,
,,Tropical Man made garden,5,,A unique experience within the concrete jungle. Gives a 360-degree view including from the top. excellent sky bridge view,,
,,Strolling in the Gardens,5,,"Strongly recommend for family with little ones. Variety of beautiful flowers to see in the Flower Dome and great to lose yourself in the tropical setting of Rainforest Dome.. Huge outdoor gardens and lakes to explore. (Please get a map from the reception) Gardens by the bay is also linked to Marina Bay Sands Hotel and Shopping. (Some considerable walking to do)

For meals, there are lots to choose from Cafes, Fast Food, Restaurants that are kids friendly..

Do check the weather or arm yourself with umbrellas as most parts of the Gardens are not sheltered from the weather.",,
,,Fabulous,5,,"This attraction(free) is easy to get to on the MRT, next to the Gardens by the bay Hotel. Everything is well laid out, you can easily walk around the gardens it is not to big.There are two domes in the garden housing plants etc, but both these attractions have afee. The gardens are a must at night as they have a light show twice a night.",,
,,Really enjoyed,5,,"Very nice to walk around, I went there in the evening so it鈥檚 not hot and I can see the light show, it鈥檚 like I鈥檓 in the jungle of a fairytale, I didn鈥檛 have a chance to see the other part but it鈥檚 give me the list of thing to do and to go back.",,
,,Beautiful garden,4,,"The nearest MRT station is Bayfront. The outdoor garden is free entrance, but for the Flower Dome, Cloud Forest, and the Skywalk, you need to pay for entrance. This garden will be very beautiful if the weather is sunny, unfortunately when i visited this, the weather is cloudy and rain. There are so many areas that you can explore here.
One minus that i found is the toilet is quite dirty and they don鈥檛 use the seated toilet like in the hotel or mall.",,
,,Beautifull ! !!!!!,5,,Great place to see of course! The greenhouse with the waterfall is great! The greenhouse with the flowers is superb! And the trees are beautiful especially at night with sound and light. Not to miss!,,
,,Must see in Singapore,5,,"Great experience, different from anything else. Put time aside, suggest half a day for both the Gardens and the Cloud forest",,
,,"Stunning Greenhouses, Vast Array of Plants",5,,This should be on your to do list for Singapore. The greenhouses are beautiful. I could spend all day wandering around the place.,,
,,Amazing experience at Magical Creation,5,,"I, my wife and daughters had an amazing experience at Gardens by the Bay, a huge, colourful, futuristic park in the bay area of Singapore. While it鈥檚 famous super-tree structures offer an impressive skywalk over the gardens, the over-sized seashell-shaped greenhouses recreate chilly mountain climates and hundreds of trees and plants offer scope for discovery, makes this a must go destination in Singapore for great fun for both kids and adults.",,
,,Absolutely amazing,5,,"We stayed in Singapore just before Christmas and Gardens by the Bay was the one place I really wanted to see and I wasn鈥檛 disappointed!

It was amazing, from the Flower Dome to the Cloud Forest. We spent all day there and with a 19 and a 21 year old, this is no mean feat!

Everyone absolutely loved it and it surpassed all my expectations!

The Flower Dome was so Christmassy and the whole thing was really quite magical",,
,,Amazing,5,,"Wow!! This place is absolutely amazing. Make sure you allow at least half a day to see it all and stay into the evening for the light show. Pllenty of food available. Take your time to really see things. When we were there so many people just seemed to be rushing through taking selfies everywhere, they would've missed so much.",,
,,The power of natural,5,,Nice natural inside the big glass.. fresh air and quite from the busy city. Is a good place to spent during weekends,,
,,Very beautiful place,5,,Clean and spacious park that is suitable for the whole family. Must visit is the two dome buildings in the middle of the garden.,,
,,A must see!!,5,,"The gardens run from the MRT Gardens by the Bay which is a lovely walk past lakes and gardens and beneath Marina Bay Sands Hotel. You arrive first at Supertree Grove which has a Skyway walk suspended between 2 of the huge and beautiful ""trees"". Walking through the Grove you get to the Flower and Cloud Forest Domes. Buy your tickets there and you may be given a free entry to the Skyway. The Cloud Forest has a stunning walk down the man-made hill to ground level. Visit Supertree Grove in the evening for a truly unmissable sound and light show lighting up the trees at 7.45 and 8.45 each evening.",,
,,"Supertree Grove, Flower Dome & Cloud Forest.",5,,"I visited Gardens By the Bay on my first day in Singapore and I was very impressed with it. From the moment you walk in and see the Supertree Grove you are mesmerized and then to walk around the 22 metre high Skyway was breathtaking. The views from the top were fantastic, you can see all over the Gardens. Then I moved onto the Domes, they are huge and I'm still trying to work out how they got all the flowers from all over the world to grow in the Flower Dome. The sculptures were also excellent. It was great walking around and seeing all the different flowers from all the different countries. My next stop was the Cloud Forest. You walk in and the huge water fall is your first impression, then you slowly make you way up the man made mountain 35 metres to the top admiring all the Orchids, Ferns and numerous other plants. I was very impressed with all that I saw and after the Domes, I continued to walk around admiring all the beautiful plants. Just wish I could grow them in my garden. A really lovely day.",,
,,Ammmmazzzzziiinnnnnggggg,5,,"Where do I start, this place is amazing the cloud Forrest is gorgeous. The flower dome was closed on the day I visited but didn鈥檛 bother me. The evening light show was great and free.",,
,,Sustainability is the word,5,,A must do in Singapore. Besides de beauty of the gardens the whole concept of sustainability around it is amazing. Don鈥檛 miss the cloud garden.,,
,,Fabulous sights,5,,"Used the 3 day Singapre city pass (not to be confused with the Hippo Pass) to get us there via the hop on hop off bus and gain entry to the flower and cloud domes. Views are spectacular, however the cloud dome with is walkway was nerve racking for those, not too good with heights! Didn't stay as long as some people writing reviews, found we got around it all within 2 and a half hours. Visited again for the light show at night. Definitely worth seeing if yo1u can squeeze in the time. Only lasts just under 15 minutes but if you happen to be in the area, go. Much busier for the light show than in the day time and you need to secure your place to view.",,
,,Stunning,5,,"If you do nothing else, you must do these gardens. They are a mind blast, at night especially. You can book entry tickets on-line. I have not been so seriously impressed before. The construction, planning, up-keep are all amazing.",,
,,Just a lovely day,5,,"All I can say is if in Singapore go and enjoy how man made and nature can work together in wonder and beauty.
I can鈥檛 remember the cost, so it means I thought it reasonable, it is easy to get to by public bus, it is good value and a wonderful attraction.

It takes at least half a day but you could easily spend more time there. Fantastic for the solo traveller, the family with kids young and old, they were all there and all enjoying.

There are the outdoor gardens to enjoy for free and two domes, the cloud and the flower domes, have a cost. One ticket gets you into both. There is a sky walk to enjoy for a fee, but sadly when I was there it was closed due to rain.

Highly recommend to all.",,
,,Interesting gardens beware of selfies takers,4,,This has a lot of flower options to see in the two gardens and worked as a good attraction while it rained. It wasn鈥檛 expensive. There are a lot of people posing for selfies pictures which was out of control so beware. We had numerous people back into us as they tried to take a photo. Go during the week to avoid the tour buses,,
,,Excellent park,5,,"Extremely interesting large park near Marina Bay. In the park there are two huge air-conditioned domes Flover Dome and Cloud Forest which themselves are also extremely interesting. There are also huge artificial trees - Supertree Grove. This is one of the biggest attractions to visit if you are in Singapore.
It is most easily reached either by the Marina Bay Sands pedestrian bridge or directly from the nearby MRT Bayfront station.",,
,,Easily the most enjoyable thing to do in SG.,5,,On the day we went the Flower Dome was closed but even with just the Cloud Forest Dome it was probably the most enjoyable experience I鈥檝e had in SG and I have to come here three times a year on business. Will visit again for sure when I feel the need to decompress in 鈥榥ature.鈥?,,
,,Out of this World,5,,One of the most magical nights we spent in Singapore. Light show starts at 8:00PM. Once it鈥檚 dark the gardens come to life. Totally unbelievable. Drinks on the 17th rooftop floor of Indio Chine are a must. EBH,,
,,Simply awesome!,5,,"My very first visit there although I've heard about it many times and seen pictures of it in travel documentaries. Being there was simply an awesome experience especially the canopy walk. I could not get enough of it (taking in the sight). Before dark, the huge trees are breathtaking. By night with all the flickering running lights, it's like a spacious wonderland! The light show is awesome! On my next trip to Singapore, I promise myself to spend a full day there.",,
,,Excellent,4,,"Very good, well worth the visit, lots to see and do, beautiful gardens from all over the world and the cloud forest is spectacular.",,
,,Breathtaking,5,,Amazing man-made waterfall and botanical gardens. You can easily spend around 2-3 hours walking around. The suspension bridge is a must do.,,
,,Lights music action!!,5,,"I went to the free light show at 7.45pm. Everyone just sits on the grass and looks upwards. The coordination of lights and music is amazing. I did giggle when the soundtrack to Indiana Jones came in. Top tip, if you want to do the walk up in the trees buy your ticket before 8pm.",,
,,A must see in Singapore!,5,,"What an amazing place this is! So many varieties of plants and flowers. The skywalk was a bit daunting as an Acrophobic, got half way around and had to go back down. The gardens are amazing!",,
,,Absolutely brilliant especially the Cloud Forest.,5,,"The Flower Dome and the gardens are a credit to Singapore. I can't praise the Cloud Forest enough for the beautiful flowers, foliage, waterfall and features. It is incredible and reminds me of our own Eden Project in Cornwall.",,
,,Spectacular at every turn,5,,"We loved our time at the Gardens. Cloud Forest was an amazing, visceral experience, Flower Dome was a truly beautiful display, and the light show in the Supertree Grove was truly spectacular. A must visit when in Singapore.",,
,,Lovely walk along the waterfront to the free gardens.,4,,"The walk along the waterfront to get to the outdoor gardens before the domes (Flower/Cloud Forest) is lovely. Very well landscaped and easy walking paths. They do offer a shuttle from the subway stop to the Domes entrance for 3 SD each if you are coming straight from the subway. We walked right from our hotel all along the waterfront to the gardens. Very peaceful and the flower tree structures are unique to see day or night. We went at night to see the music/lighted trees display, well worth it.",,
,,Not to be missed,5,,such an amazing place. The creators should be super proud. The domes are fabulous and the grounds are well maintained. Lovely to see such a magnificent garden open to all .,,
,,A evening visit,5,,This is our second visit to the gardens we went late afternoon and evening especially to see the light show. The cloud pavilion was spectacular as was the tree light show. A wonderful evening .,,
,,A Garden in the City,4,,"If you are a nature lover Garden by the Bay is a place for you. There are two domes. Flower dome and Cloud Forest Dome. Both are nice attractions. Be sure you bring your cameras with you if you want to visit both domes because they have amazing view. Lots of flowers, plants, and trees.

Highly recommended for all ages.",,
,,Jardin Pres Bay,4,,If you are a nature lover then its is a must visit place for you!! The beauty will make you get lost in it and you will not even realize the amount of time you spent here.,,
,,The Rain Forest enclosure was something out of this world,5,,I actually felt like I was walking in a rain forest. The whole place is huge and is amazing in every way. I've never seen anything even remotely like it.,,
,,Stunning,5,,"We visited twice - night to see the super tree lights and by the day for gardens. Just stunning. Grounds are larger than expected and enjoyable to wander around. Check the website before you visit to see if any areas will be closed.
Plenty of eating options. More queues at night and didn鈥檛 wait for anything during the day.",,
,,Neat but a bit of a showy tourist attraction,4,,It kind of feels like a mix between botanical gardens and an amusement park as there are a lot of touristy attractions like what they call the Supertrees which are metal tree-like structure decorated with real plants and you can pay to take an elevator up to do the treetop walk among the supertrees. There is also a free light show at night at the supertrees which is actually quite good. They also have climate-controlled domes like the cloudforest dome. It's a neat and interesting place but everything just feels a little forced and artificial even the real plants,,
,,A must place to visit,5,,This is a lovely place to visit both day and night!! It is calm and peaceful with much to see. The light show at night is wonderful but is only on for a limited time so be careful you don鈥檛 miss it!! These gardens were one of our favourite places in Singapore. A must place to see!!,,
,,Awesome place!!!!,5,,"The place it鈥檚 awesome, its feel like you are in other planet!! A place to walk, relax and take pictures. The trees structures just spectacular ! We went in the afternoon and wandered around until night to see the night lights show!!
A must see in Singapore!",,
,,Beautiful Oasis,5,,Beautiful oasis located in the heart of Singapore. These structures are nicely layed out with plenty of information regarding plant type and origin. Great for all ages and a must visit while in Singapore.,,
,,Amazing place!!,5,,It was one of the amazing places to visit in Singapore. Very nice & beautiful flowers & plants there. The atmosphere is very good. Don't miss your camera when you go there!,,
,,A must for every nature lover,5,,"Two incredible domes; the Cloud Forest where you can experience a close to real experience of walking through a forest full of a variety of plants, trees and flowers, and the Flower Dome full of almost every kind of flower from all over the world. All this within huge enclosed, temperature-controlled domes that helps keeping you from getting tired.",,
,,Great fun but put on a jumper!,4,,"While visiting the Gardens by the Bay is free, admission to the domes is about 拢15 pp. Walking around the gardens is fun but the domes are the main attraction. Bear in mind that they are cooled conservatories and we got very cold walking around them (needed a break between the first and the second to warm up). The domes are well looked after and fun to explore but it's not mind-blowing so if you are not into greenery and flowers, I am not sure how much you'd enjoy yourself.",,
,,Interesting area to move around,5,,Lot to learn and observe. If you are lucky you may come across Otters in its natural movement. Varities of cacti and Indian trees.,,
,,You must visit !!! It's a paradise!!,5,,"Absolutely incredible experience. We loved it. I love that the outdoor areas are all free to enter. You only need to pay for the 2 domes and sky walk.
Buy a ticket for all 3 parts as it's well worth the money.
Both domes are incredible and I recommend doing the sky walk once it's dark. It's loads better.
Then at around 19.30 and 21.30 there is a music and light show. For this chose the late one at dark and lay down on the grass lawn below the sky walk for an amazing view. It really is spectacular.",,
,,Amazing place and definitely worth a visit (both day and night time for the laser show),5,,"What a beautiful place, we didn't have long in Singapore so had to cramp things in and would have liked more time here, still we spent half a day and could have probably stayed longer..., we didn't see it at night but I've been told it is spectacular with the laser show and the trees lit up, definitely worth a visit during the day and night.

They have two bio orbs (similar to the Eden Project in the UK) with stunning plants. There is a sky concourse to go through the trees but can get shut due to thunder storms (which happen often in Singapore)

Well worth a visit...",,
,,Nice gardens with loads to do,4,,"Many parts to this garden, it鈥檚 a 10 min walk from mrt. This brings you to ticket booth were you can buy tickets to the Flower dome and Cloud forest both worth a visit. Then you have the super trees which are 10 min walk from ticket booth sound and light shows run for 15 min at 7.45 and 8.45 and a very large garden area be prepared to walk a fair bit though, you can get a ride to flower domes and cloud forest for $3 valid all day. It does it hot and humid so take water",,
,,beautiful futuristic place,5,,"one should never miss the OCBC skyway while visiting garden complex. although flower dome can boast of many varities of flowers and plants, my personal favourite would be cloud dome, which i found more fascinating . and the supertree grove is more like a scene out of some futuristic movie .. beautiful place overall and not to be missed while visiting Singapore.",,
,,Must visit!,5,,"The gardens can be seen as three different areas. First there is a large park area that is open and free to wander. Beautifully laid out and plenty of information as you walk around.
Then there are the 鈥榯rees鈥? These structures are actually disguised air con and air flow structures for the two eco domes. They also support a key power source by disguising solar panels. For the tourist, they are the centre of the evening light show but also support the SkyWalk which is a suspended pathway above the gardens. Don鈥檛 miss the evening light show!
Finally the two eco domes provide the final touch with displays and information centred around plants and the environment.
I don鈥檛 want to say anymore as discovering the delights is down to the individual. Don鈥檛 miss it!",,
,,Gorgeous gardens!,5,,Lovely oasis in the busy city of Singapore. Stunning gardens and kudos to the gardeners who keep the weeds at bay. Well worth spending time wandering the grounds.,,
,,Nice break with flower,5,,"First we quite unsure about this place as ticket price might too high if it doesn't good. Finaaly we decide to give it a try and we are correct. From hot weather or raining outside, we touch the cool breeze in the flower dome. Then mesmerize with flower bloom and decoration. We all have question in mind that how they make it happen. We can travel in every continent of the world in one place. However it would be better to visit in weekday as it's too crowded and it's very difficult to take photo without some bony in the scene.

After flower dome, wr are stunning with cloud forest. The waterfall that make us feel cold. It looks unbelieveabke to see all plant that rarely find.

Then we try to catch up the show of Supertree that contain light and sound. It's spectacular show and free of charge. The best position to enjoy this show is on the floor so prepare if you plan to visit.",,
,,Long walks best time to visit is late afternoon,4,,It's a good place to relax and take pictures with beautiful flowers from around the world .Out of the two observatory cloud forest is much better then the flower dome area.You may find online promo prices which gives you a better price then walk ins .Overall great experience,,
,,Great attraction! Must see!,5,,"This is one of the best attractions in Singapore and the world. It has two domes, one mimics a mountain that has different flowers and vegetation at different altitude; the other dome mimics different geographical climate. Our family loved this attraction and we have come back to it every time we visit Singapore. There is always something new. Also, the Super Tree attraction is conveniently located next to it. I would recommend coming early in the day or late afternoon/evening otherwise it can get crowded.",,
,,Unique collection of nature amidst technology,5,,We hired a photographer and took several family pictures which came out fabulous! The variety of plants and flowers was so colourful that it provided a wonderful backdrop to our pictures. The towers are amazing and the Marina Bay Sands Hotel in the background was surreal. Loved it!,,
,,Beautiful Attraction in Singapore,4,,I had the opportunity to visit the Gardens by the Bay on a recent trip and was fortunate to catch the Musical Rhapsody. This place is a must see for any traveler to Singapore. I did not get the chance to fully tour the garden but look forward to exploring some more on my next trip to Singapore.,,
,,Well worth a visit,4,,"The first time we went to the gardens we were hoping to see it all. Unfortunately both the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest were shut. One for a private function and the other for cleaning. We learnt that each month they are shut on a rotation for cleaning but not usually at the same time. Check with your hotel or on the website before going.
We queued for an hour to go on the Skypath which was fantastic....especially the light show....best to visit at night.
The next day we returned to view the Domes which again are well worth a visit..Very interesting",,
,,Fantastic and absolutely beautiful,5,,What a stunning place to visit. On arrival we took the 20 minute tour in a small vehicle audio tour which took us over quite a lot of the Gardens and of course saved us walking in the heat. This gave us a good idea of what was at the gardens. We visited both Domes and both were breathtakingly beautiful (and air-conditioned). At the conclusion of the visit we took a Shuttle Service back to the MRT. There is also easy access to Marina Bay Sands from this station.,,
,,Great attraction for you and your mature children,5,,"Definitely one of the best attractions in the world. Senior citizens may want to take the shuttle to the main attractions (Flower Dome and Cloud Forest) and save your energy to walk to the food stalls at Satay by the Bay. Descending from the Cloud Forest, you become part of a captive audience watching presentations on global warming. However, this is a must for children.",,
,,Beauriful,4,,"Definitely a must see, the grounds are beautiful. There are two domes you can visit, one which has the waterfall, and one which is full of flower displays from all over the world. If you are only going to see one then definitely catch the waterfall.",,
,,Absolutely stunning!,4,,An absolute must if you are in Singapore. The domes and flowers inside are spectacular! There were orchids of every color in the rainbow and then some.,,
,,Must see attraction,5,,Very cool and easy to visit as we were staying at the Marina Bay Sands. Walked over to these and once inside were able to witness the beauty of all the flowers and the giant mountain/waterfall. Certainly worth the time to come over here and something everyone should see in Singapore!,,
,,Unbelievable!,5,,"Words cannot do this place justice. From the flower dome to cloud forest and the skyway between the super trees to the evening light show. It is simply amazing.
Seeing the super trees on tv was the main reason we decided to visit Singapore as they looked so incredible on screen. I can safely say, they are even better in real life. Absolutely fantastic day. Everyone should visit at least once.",,
,,WOW!,5,,"The Marina and buildings surrounding the gardens are astounding and the gardens are amazing, colourful, wistful, witty. Great Chinese New Year display. Well laid out. Only saw the flowers, cacti, trees, not the rainforest",,
,,Stunning!,5,,"This was the top of my list on our recent short visit to Singapore and it didn鈥檛 disappoint! We wandered around all the lakes and gardens outside first and were very impressed with what we saw. Outside is all free to look around, apart from the walkway between the trees. You can spend ages wandering around these areas, even before the conservatories. There was an additional charge to use the walkway above the ground, between the super trees and, it was well worth going up. The views were great. Both conservatories , the flower dome and the cloud forest , were stunning. Everywhere you looked was a treat for the eyes, so thoughtfully done and exceptionally well planted. Allow plenty of time to cover it all. My only regret is that we didn鈥檛 get chance to revisit at night",,
,,Get close to nature,5,,One of the best place to vist .truely unique.Try klook app for online cheaper tickets and to avoid queue.Visit around 5 pm so that you can visit both the domes daytime and by the you come out SUPERTREE will be glowing with amazing lights .This way you can catch both day view as well as evening lights .plenty of place to eat and drink.,,
,,Magical,5,,"A must if you are in Singapore- fantastic varieties of trees, bushes and flowers. At night the light show is not to be missed.",,
,,"giant garden of singapore, prepare yourself for too much walking",5,,"good to visit, start going between 2-3pm till night time, so it wont be very hot. plan your visit at flower dome first, then cloud forest and lost world (better than flower dome), take time to visit the gardens too., get a map at the entrance so you will be guided. at the back/beside flower dome has good views for picture taking with singapore flyer at your background. i do not enjoy the near view of lightning the big trees, you will enjoy it much if you take it from afar. Tip* remember that dark falls in singapore at 7:30pm so , light shows start at 7:45 and 8:45. if you wanna have good views of lighting the big trees, after cloud forest, take a rest and eat. (Look for the store, after you get out of the building of cloudforest, there is a store which offers shakes and chicken hotdogs im not so sure, but hotdogs are really good, i almost eat 4 orders of it ha ha ha), then take a stroll at the back of flower dome, picture with sg flyer, then you will see the marina bay sands (shipdeck), take pictures, it has good views too, then get a timing of leaving the gardens by the bay by around 7pm, so by 7:30pm you should be afar, maybe on the bridge (to/from subway going to bayfront ave), there is a bridge there that offers a good view which you can see all the big trees, you can capture all of them when they light up. it is way better than getting another ticket for the near view, or walking up the ocbc skyway (getting tickets around 7pm, prepare for a long queue).

if you come from philippines, prepare your sg dollars with you to exchange in phils P35.50-P36.50 Dec2017, coz if you get a debit card and withdraw from sg atms, it has higher conversion at downtown (P37.50 - P38), in gardens by the bay atms and sentosa atms, the rate is much higher around P39.",,
,,amazing and unlike any garden you have ever visited,5,,"must see place if you are coming to Singapore, amazing dooms and water fall. it is also near the Marina Bay hotel, Casino and mall. go around 3pm to see the garden and can catch up the light show after sunset. also by 8pm be infant of the mall for the light show as well.",,
,,One of Singapore's top attractions,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is great. It is close to downtown, although I would take a taxi or MRT to Bayfront Station. During the day it is great and if you pay for entrance you can see a temperate and tropical building with many interesting plants. You can wander around outside for free. There are also great views of the city. T night it is spectacularly illuminated",,
,,Epitome of Technology and engineering brilliance,5,,Both the cooled conservatories are a sight to behold. Pillar less and huge. The collection and impeccable maintenance of the fauna is amazing. One of the top things to do in Singapore.,,
,,Beautiful!,5,,"Going Gardens By the Bay never failed to surprise me with the different beautiful flowers around for viewing, walking, and even taking photos. Directions were clear enough too!",,
,,Must visit in sg,4,,Good for exploring Asian flora and fauna in enclosed aircon environment on the hot hot Singapore! Beautiful at night with the lighting show. Pollen is good place to stop by for high tea break.,,
,,Van Gogh displays,5,,If your a green thumb this place is a must. So many beautiful displays from across the world and fabulous art in between. Easy access and wide walkways.,,
,,great for all the family,4,,"A while since we've been here, but have enjoyed both the glasshouses and the surrounding park(s). The giant trees are amazing at sunset/night when you see the lights and hear the music - lots of people around soaking in the atmosphere and obviously taking photos/videos. We have not yet tried the Skyway, but will try sometime. There's lots to see and do, so allow plenty of time and wear comfortable shoes",,
,,May be a bit over rated,3,,"Firstly there is an entrance fees to the 2 domes i.e. cloud forest and flower dome. Flower dome is a bit over rated. Cloud forest was nice with indoor waterfall. Although the best part is super tree grove which is actually free. Go in the evening,7pm I think( not sure about the time). Great light and sound show. Wanted to go on the skywalk which has a $8 fees but had 50 min waiting, so dropped the plan.",,
,,amazing,5,,I loved this place. I think it's better visiting it at nights. I took spectacular pictures. I definitely recommend to visit it.,,
,,An Extraordinary Gardens!,5,,"A must place to visit in your travel itinerary. Do plan your time well and check for Gardens maintenance closure. I enjoyed best the Flower Dome, Cloud Forest and Light Show (7:45pm and 8:45pm). Enjoy!!!",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"Beautiful, well kept gardens. Could do with some more seating/picnic areas (would be nice) there are trollies selling drinks/ice creams etc but fairly expensive. You鈥檙e able to pay $8 to walk up to the sky bridge.",,
,,Nice Walk!,5,,"Visited with a friend, we enjoyed the walk around the garden. Nothing too impressing. Luckily, we came on a quiet day otherwise I would of hated it.",,
,,MUST SEE!,5,,"Do not skip this on any trip to Singapore. The Super Trees during the day and night, the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome - all so amazing! I would visit this every time I would visit as it's simply wonderful.",,
,,Cool and Beautiful,4,,"It was different that I thought it would be. I saw and read how hot it was, bit it was really nice and cool inside. I totally enjoyed my trek in this two dome. It was extra special because of the Chinese New Year. They had dragons and lanterns displayed for the year of the dog. It was really nice.",,
,,Fairytales & Tulips,5,,"We looked at the place and thought a 'couple of hours would do it'; how wrong we were! Wandering through and identifying the fairy tales each part portrayed was entertainment enough. But there was the variety of tulips which blew me away; and I spend a lot of time in Holland. After several hours we wandered across to the Cloud Dome for a quick look; no such luck. Every corner was great, even the Lego garden. It was dark by the time we got back to the hotel - Highly recommend everyone visits",,
,,"If you have plenty of time, otherwise choose Botanic Garden!",3,,"It is nice, but not as special as some of the comments might imply.

As we stayed at the Marina Bay Sands we strolled around the Gardens which are right next to the hotel, and there are nice areas, of course, but overall it seemed quite artificial and did not appeal to us as Singapore Botanic Garden.

If you have plenty of time, go there, it is unique after all and you might like the modern interpretation of the garden.

For us, it was mostly boring and we actually fell asleep while watching the light show (it seemed to be Christmas themed) from our balcony. :D",,
,,"Wow, wow and wow",5,,What a fantastic place this is! Everywhere was so clean and the gardens are beautifully manicured. We paid extra to do the skywalk which was fine. Thoroughly enjoyed walking here in the heat of the day.,,
,,Gardens by the bay indeed,4,,The place is simply amazing from start to finish. The amazing indoor waterfalls and the dragon overlooking the gardens. Everything was truly breathtaking.,,
,,Excellent attraction Wow .....,5,,"As a non gardener, this was one of the most breath taking gardens we have ever visited, to say they are gardens under values it massively. The domes and waterfalls are out of this world, the best attraction in Singapore .",,
,,A must visit.,5,,You will need 2 days to view and enjoy all area .try to read up before visit and you will appreciate what's it all about Can spend all day Seeing just half the area .plenty eating places and cool domes and woodlands,,
,,Absolutely amazing,5,,Especially the flower dome and cloud forest are worth seeing as well as the super tree grove! Absolutely stunning! Must visit when in Singapore!,,
,,Spectacular,5,,"Spectacular gardens with a huge variety of flowers and trees, and of course the Supertree Grove. You can ""climb"" into the tallest supertree which is approx 45 m in height and experience the breathtaking view. After dark, they play a a show of lights and music that I have never experienced before. Is one of the 1000 places to see before you die...",,
,,Good place,5,,"Alot of different kind of flower,and some i didnt see before , is a nice place to bring kids n elderly go . This is the 3 rd time to go there , i will go again",,
,,Worth to go,4,,It鈥檚 a breathtaking view at Garden by the Bay and have different view for day and night! Shud go for both timing and get urself relax at the ambience.,,
,,"Very big name, not so astonishing as you would think",3,,"We visited the Gardens in the evening. Many, many people around us. We had to wait in a row to use the stairs. Very hot because there is no wind and because of the large crowd. Visit during daytime is best, and go for pictures to the observation desk of of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel in the evening.",,
,,A must see in Singapore,5,,"Beautiful park and much photographed. The cooled flower area was disappointing but the rain forest was an absolute top attraction.
In the evening a light and sound show is performed and I can highly recommend this.
The sky bridge is worth a daytime visit.
Easy to enter from the famous hotel.",,
,,Lovely show and the sense of freedom,5,,The show happens with people spread out on the huge area and people can be seated freely anywhere across the gardens by the bay and they get to see the show. And its not like you need to be seated in 1 place to view it the whole time. We made it to the 8 pm show and it was worth the effort going all the way to this place.,,
,,Beautiful,5,,This place has got two important attractions. Flower dome with various types of flowers and cloud forest will give you a feeling of being in a true forest with a waterfall at the entrance. Entrance fee is around 35$ per person for visiting each attraction. Dont buy souveneirs from here as it is very expensive.,,
,,Lovely Park,4,,Visited Gardens by the Bay last week twice. It is a very nice park to visit with lots of variety in attractions.,,
,,"Loved it last time, disappointed this time",3,,"We came back today to do the flower dome as we had done the mountain dome last time.
Just as well as the mountain dome was closed for maintenance - with no warning given. I'd have been very annoyed if I'd trekked all the way from the MRT in 34 degrees to find it shut.
Half the toilets were closed. The flower dome was in the middle of a 'display change' some many of the flowers were dead or dying. The restaurant in the dome was closed for a private party. Again, no warning and on the way out, the gift shop was closed for a stock take and the ladies loos were out of paper.

We were still charged full price, though. Not good enough, really. I understand that maintenance has to be done but they could warn you at the station and you can make a choice before you make the walk in the heat.",,
,,"Simply amazing, Must visit",5,,"Words cannot begin to describe how amazing gardens by the bay truly are & pictures really don鈥檛 do it justice.. we visited late February for the afternoon/evening (3-8.30) this is simply one of the best experiences/visits in the whole of south-east Asia, the gardens are amazing. We decided to visit the cloud forest but give the flower dome a miss, the forest wasn鈥檛 cheap but was certainly worth the visit, but the best thing by far was the sky walk on the trees we booked our tickets and after staff recommendations, we queued at 7.30 as it was getting dark and they said it was best to be at the top of the trees for sunset/night time, during queuing there was a 8pm tree show, which was the highlight of the day/experience & Singapore (watch a video of this on YouTube) we got to the top around 8.15 after queuing for around 45 minutes, well worth it. Strongly recommend this, especially at night/ sunset to anyone visiting Singapore. ( gardens can be easily reached via the city train service & is located next to marina sands hotel)",,
,,Well worth a visit to this amazing location,5,,"Great place to spend a half day exploring the gardens and structures. The cloud forest and flower gardens are unique and amazing. We visited early and would recommend as it gets really busy as the day goes on, it鈥檚 a great place for photos but as it gets busy you have to be on the look out getting in other peoples selfies or in the way of other photographers. We took the tram option to the domes and back again, this costs a few extra dollars but worth it. There is a nice gift shop, but the staff at the tills are a bit stressed when it gets busy, the lady we had was very stressed and rushed wrapping our fragile gifts and throwing them into a bag, when asked why she was being like this she just repeatedly said log queues.......",,
,,3 days in Singapore,5,,What a fabulous place. Did an evening tour to Gardens of the Bay which was well worth the money. The next days went to see the Cloud Dome which unfortunately was closed for maintenance that day but was able to visit the Flower Dome. Would love to go back,,
,,Loved the Light Show,5,,A must if you鈥檙e in Singapore in the evening to watch the light show! Brilliant. We didn鈥檛 visit during the day - it鈥檚 an intriguing concept. Enjoy 馃槏,,
,,Over the top,3,,"A must see despite being a major tourist trap. Definitely get entry to flower and cloud domes if only to escape the heat ( but bring a sweater).
Flowers are varied but some looked a bit darn wonder how they survive in extreme conditions (temperature very controlled and too cool) with no insect bee or natural life.
The cloud forest had a sad excuse for waterfall but the main spectacle was watching others take corny selfies.
Finally the video on global warming and tips on how to save the world was priceless.... the irony was not lost on us being in a huge air conditioned dome ! Imagine the carbon footprint we just left behind .",,
,,Never fails to impress,5,,"Gardens by the Bay never fails to amaze me since its opening and it is worth going over and over because there is always something new throughout the year, most notably the flower displays in Flower Dome. My favourites so far have to be the cherry blossom, tulip, and dahlia displays.",,
,,Simple wow !!!,5,,"You just cannot believe the beauty of the cloud forest and the garden maintained by them. Its wonderful. Specially the rare species of flowers and plants they have gathered. Unbelievable place. My recommendation, if you miss this in singapore then you really have missed singapore",,
,,The light show in the night is astonishing,5,,We went to the cloud forest thing and it was unique! You get to experience a whole another ecosystem in Singapore without leaving! It is a must to go to the light show at night!,,
,,"Great relaxing place for solo, couples and family",4,,"Gardens by the Bay is a wondeful attraction, an open space for leisurely stroll. An escape from the very concrete n populated spaces in Singapore. A stroll around the garden is free of charge and a great way to enjoy a relaxing day.
You can also visit the paid indoor gardens to view the plants. Some of the exhibit areas are changed and updated with new showcased plants.
As it is near to Marina Bay Sands, u can easily do the 2 places together.
Gardens By the Bay can be reached by the Mass Rapid train (MRT), stopping at Bayfront Station on the Circle line and walking about 10mins through a covered underpass.",,
,,Great for family sundays,5,,Favourite place for my 5 year old Daughter with plenty of climbing activities and flowers and bonus water play and spider net,,
,,Beautiful place for a evening in greenery,5,,"Went here by a evening from sky park tower. Walking through different types of gardens in one place is amazing. After lighting those big artificial trees looks very beautiful, unfortunately we missed to climb and walk between trees. A must to visit place in singapore",,
,,Beautiful evening of lights!,5,,"The light show among the Super Trees was fun and enjoyable. We just sat on the soft grass and enjoyed the music and lights.
Be aware there will be crowds leaving at the same time, so the taxi line will be long. We booked a taxi online, so we were able to skip that mess.",,
,,Man made,3,,Man made garden and is a waste of money. It may be appealing for people from cities but sure not for those who are surronded by nature.,,
,,Local but still amazed by the beauty,5,,"Been to GBTB numerous times since it was opened in 2012. Definitely pay to visit the Cloud Forest and especially the Flower Dome as they often refresh their collection of plant species, which is what keeps me returning.",,
,,Singapore Garden by the Bay,5,,"Cloud Forrest was Very informative. Excellent for families, young and old. Simply magnificent. Rest rooms are all very clean. Restaurants and carts for thirsty people are in every corner. Bring umbrella in case it rains or for sunny, bright and humid afternoon.",,
,,Go twice - morning and evening to see it at its best,5,,"The Gardens by the Bay was our favorite spot on a recent long weekend in Singapore. The actual gardens are lovely and are enjoyable for an early morning or evening stroll. The supergrove trees are amazing to see in person!! It's free to walk in the gardens -
you can pay a fee to go up on the elevated walkway between the trees and for shuttle service around the gardens. Definitely recommend going early in the morning before it's swamped with tourists. You'll get the best photos of the trees without all the crowds. Also definitely recommend stopping back by the trees in the late afternoon and grabbing a spot under the trees for the (FREE!) evening show. The show is amazing and everyone seems to come out for it! Let the crowds die down after the show before heading to the MRT. Once the show is over - head over to the Promenade on the other side of Marina Bay Sands for the light show on the bay (held nightly 2-3 times for free!).",,
,,Don't pay to see the Domes!,2,,"Was not sure what was interesting so bought tickets via Klook which were entry to the Cloud and Flowers Dome.my advise is to save yr money and skip them as they were not worth the time. It was just exhibits of flowers, plants, the indoor waterfall and that was it. Nothing great at all, was truly disappointed. It was better to just walk around the park for photos at no cost, enjoy the water play and playground if you have kids and eat at the many cafes or Satay by the Bay food court.",,
,,Supertrees!,5,,"This is my favorite place in Singapore. I love that you can go in for free, and there are so many walking paths lined with thousands of gorgeous flowers year-round! Also love the night light show with the Supertrees!",,
,,Amazing!,5,,The whole tour was incredible and enjoyable. So many type of plantations and different type of flowers to see admire.A Garden dome with fully air conditioner!,,
,,Spectacular,4,,I鈥檓 not a fan of gardens due to allergies however it was worth the visit. I would recommend found at sunset as you can see the majestic beauty of the gardens. Visit the cloud forest a unique experience.,,
,,Must see in Singapore,5,,"Just like Kings Park in Perth, Western Australia, Gardens by the Bay is a truly iconic attraction in Singapore that lives up to the good reviews. It is wonderful day and night. It is a joy to walk around the plants and flowers in both domestic and the cool air is a great relief from Singapore's hot weather. The Flower Dome changes its display of flowers in relation to different occassions. Truly worth a visit.",,
,,Great night time entertainment,4,,Well worth a visit when you're in Singapore. We went at night to see the light show and it didn't disappoint. The view of the city from here is really good. Try & pre book a taxi to pick you up as the queue after is crazy.,,
,,Gardens 21st century style,5,,Gardens by the bay are only a few years old yet they are already luxuriant and exciting t visit. If you cross the Eden project in Cornwall with a futuristic film set you start to get the feel of this place. The aerial walkway between the artificial steel trees is a must for the views of the gardens and the whole area. I spent about 90 mins here but only saw a fraction of what was on offer.,,
,,Absolutely amazing.,5,,"Absolutely amazing architecture, flora and organization. The facility is well worth everyone鈥檚 time. The process. You can get their by bus or by cab. Buy a ticket for both greenhouses , and start with the tram ride. The tram takes you from virtually where the cab drops you off , right next to the ticket sales area. You get a 20 minute or so narrated ride around the park and then you are dropped off next to the entrance to the first greenhouse. Plan on several hours to walk thru the greenhouses. Keep in mind, these are huge 12 story tall building!! Whether you are a plant nut or not, this place is amazing. The route thru one greenhouse leads you to the entrance for the next

For lunch, take the short walk to the giant trees and take the elevator to the restaurant at the top",,
,,Just amazing place to visit free evening light shows,5,,"Remarkable diversity of plants and even more so the forest section
under massive glass / steel structures. Also fabulous free twice nightly light show on the vertical forests . Also a free laser show across the bay so this area is full
and active at night . Definitely one to do when in Singapore",,
,,Beautiful attraction,5,,Gardens by the Bay is an amazing Park where you can spend hours walking around. Beautiful little parks inside the Park. Definitely worth a visit,,
,,Magnificent Gardens,5,,"We visited these gardens when our cruise ship docked at Singapore for our return home, so the amount of time we had to visit the gardens was somewhat limited. It was also raining at the time which meant that the OCB Skyway was closed. Because of the rain, much of our time was spent in the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest, which were both absolutely spectacular in different ways. We saw enough of the rest of the gardens to realise that there is enough interest to occupy a family for a whole day and we are just sorry that the inclement weather prevented us from seeing the Dragonfly & Kingfisher Lakes, the Supertree Grove, the Bay East Garden, the Heritage Garden the World of Plants etc, etc in more detail. Access to the gardens from the Mass Rapid Transit System (MRT) is extremely easy as the gardens are right next to the Bayfront Station on the Circle Line, and after visiting the gardens, The Marina Bay Sands Hotel is also well worth a visit. We feel sure that we will return to Singapore again sometime and the gardens will certainly be on our list to re-visit.",,
,,Beautiful - especially the cloud forest,5,,Gardens by the bay is a beautiful place where you can seek to enjoy nature and architecture. The wonderful man made waterfall structure in the cloud forest is amazing and a must see.,,
,,Seeing is believing,5,,"I have been a student of Botany hence it was all the more joyous to experience the exquisite display of flowers from different regions of the world. It is so well maintained & laid out.
The cloud burst exposes one to one of the highest indoor waterfalls of the world. The vertical garden is a treat to the eyes.",,
,,Long distances,4,,Great and interesting location. Could have spend more time here. The climate makes the distances between things something to consider at this place when taking a toddler with you.,,
,,Must visit Gardens,5,,We enjoyed our visit to the Gardens. It is a must. Beautiful displays of flowers and plants from all over the World. Allow at least half a day for these gardens.,,
,,Man made natur,4,,Nice place to visit. A lot of variety of plants and flowers. Must visit this garden in Singapore. The view of Marina Bay Sands is fantastic. During the Lantern Festival there r lot of activities going on.,,
,,Lovely,5,,I am not one for gardening but really enjoyed the displays. Used the shuttle to get to the attractions which was very helpful.,,
,,Pleasant and green gardens,5,,Beautiful gardens and greenery. 740 and 840 pm there's a sound and light show.. garden rhapsody.. nice and different.,,
,,Magnificent!!!!,5,,"I was so impressed by Singapore stunning garden designs and architecture!!! For a place famous for their ports and businessman I was blown away by its colours, kind people and amazing attention to detail in every corner!!! The best part is that it鈥檚 all really affordable!!

Worth a visit for sure!!!",,
,,Beautiful,5,,I will be the first to admit that most botanical gardens are not my favorite attractions. However this is really unique and well worth the time wandering.,,
,,Flower Dome,5,,"Always worth a visit all year round with the different themes any time of the year. I especially like the Christmas and Chinese New Year decorations. Get tickets online to avoid the queues during the festive seasons crowd. Alternatively, when you have overseas friends in town, go for the high tea at Pollen which includes the entrance for The Flower Dome.",,
,,Garden in the city,4,,Visited the garden both in the day and night. Totally different views and feel. Truly a garden in the city with the vast greenery. Christmas decoration lit up the festive mood.,,
,,"Creatively formed, relaxingly landscaped, refreshingly equipped",5,,"A great location with the iconic Super Grove trees providing the eye catching mainstay, but there is lots more to keep you interested. The best facility for families is the water sprinkling park, a great, refreshing opportunity to run around and cool down. The staff are very precious on not touching the sprinkler poles but it is still a great experience.",,
,,Gardens by Bay,4,,"A great way to enjoy spectacular modern scennery and a festival of light (ing). Great variety of colour. Very well designed and set. The only drawback is crowds. If you do not like to feel like a sardine, then choose your timing as in some instances it can be overwhelming.",,
,,Beautiful Scenery,4,,"You can generally categories your experience to Garden by the bay by 2 segments, the paid and no-admission fee.

For the no-admission fee, Garden by the Bay still offers many to sight, especially during festive seasons, such as mid-autumn, new year eve and christmas.

For the paid admission, this is where you get to see so many beautiful, colourful florals.

But be warn, have your meals before going there, the food is a little pricey and limited.

Generally i gave it 4 stars out of 5.",,
,,Beautiful but expensive,4,,Don鈥檛 bother with both gardens. Do the one with the waterfalls. Absolutely beautiful. We spent a lot of time here where the othe garden was quite boring.m,,
,,Grardens,5,,"Great for a day out. The Sky walk is good. It鈥檚 not too expensive either. The Cloud dome is really worth going into and the Flower dome. It鈥檚 very futuristic with the flower towers in the grounds, and it all lights up at night.",,
,,"Beautiful gardens, amazing views and most of it is free!",4,,You only pay for access into the two domes. Plenty of places to eat. Many opportunities for refilling water bottles. Lots of shade and seating places. Sky Walk costs 6 dollars each and afforded incredible views of the bay and the city.,,
,,Absolute Must,5,,This is one of the absolute must visits on any stay in Singapore. The gardens are something special and the attractions are simply spectacular. You could spend hours in this place but you can also get a sense of it by taking a stroll and enjoying all that is around you.,,
,,Must visit when in Singapore,5,,It is all modern place and made in such a way that every one enjoys. Kids will definitely enjoy because of the creation of snow fall kind of environment. Only advise is that try visit after sun set as it is more beautiful.,,
,,Wow - a must see in Singapore,5,,"Loved this - make sure you have good walking shoes on, there is loads and loads to see and do. Really spectacular. Don鈥檛 miss this.",,
,,Stunning and relaxing,4,,"Beautiful placed to spend a few hours. Very pretty and the two domes are incredible, not to mention a lovely cool break from the humidity.",,
,,Amazing,5,,"What an awesome spot! I would highly recommend this to anyone visiting Singapore!
We took the $8 bus ride around the gardens when we first arrived - this was a great way for us to get a feel of the place and where everything is. We then went to the super trees, these are fantastic!!! And they are so eco friendly, the bus ride was great for us to learn about the plants.
We went to the conservatories later in the day, these were also nice and cool but very busy.
I would recommend going to the gardens as early as possible to avoid people. Doing the super trees first, these are outside so going to them early means you will avoid the heat, and as there is a limit to how many people can go up at once you also avoid waiting.
The conservatories are cool inside so best thing to do in the heat of the day!",,
,,Like stepping into an Avatar scene...,5,,Was lucky enough to visit during the Christmas build up. We visited at night time and the lights were out of this world. It would have been good to have a little more information about the plant life. For example - the olive trees seemed very ancient - how were they transported and where did they come from? I loved the mystical fogs around the rainforest walk and enjoyed seeing some of our beautiful Australian plants on display. Oh and the microscopic orchids were so intriguing. Make sure you take a warm jacket with you because it gets quite chilli. Although it was quite expensive - it was definitely money well spent.,,
,,Beautiful,5,,See the world in a few hours. Such beautiful plants and trees from different eco systems all in one place. Well organised and explained. Well worth a visit. I loved the place.,,
,,Huge Gardens,4,,"Plants everywhere which nice to enjoy in the late afternoon when the sun starts to set. But if you want to enjoy it in the afternoon, there are two options for you, Cloud Forest and Flower Dome.",,
,,A dream garden in urban life,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is a nature park adjacent to the Marina Reservoir. The park consists of three waterfront gardens: Bay South Garden, Bay East Garden and Bay Central Garden. This is a visionary plan to accommodate greenery and flora in urban life. This is one of Singapore's premier urban outdoor recreation space.

The park is quite popular attracting huge no. of visitors from each corner of the world. We were there in the afternoon & also in evening time. Observed colorful change of the garden gradually. This is really a nice attraction.",,
,,Visit,4,,Nice attraction. Friendly staff. There is a good range of flowers on display. Easy access by mrt. Pay transport from ticket counter to entrance.,,
,,Place to watch,5,,There are 2 places to visit. One is flower doom where you find different flowers... love the cactus ...they are too huge. Clod forest... nice place to visit,,
,,A unique walk about,5,,Very charming relaxing place. Even with many people visiting it doesn鈥檛 feel cramped or crowded. Queues are managed well at the dome and ticket stations.,,
,,Wow what a sight,5,,"This place is beautiful I would highly recommend going during the daylight and then again at night to see all the lights on the trees and the paths and also take advantage of the laser light show at the marina Bay Sands Hotel, where good shoes and be sure to visit the 鈥淪atay鈥?For authentic food at an affordable price.",,
,,Gardens by the bay,4,,The flowers and the lights are nice. Esp the waterfall. Beautifully decorated and cool. At nite the lights are of different colour very beautiful. There are few restaurants too,,
,,Wow!,5,,"The design of this place is unbelievable- absolutely incredible. Allow yourself 2 days to fully appreciate it - though it is possible to see most of it in one day it you would be a bit rushed! The two domes are amazing, Flower and Cloud, and you have to pay to enter them but a reasonable price. If you have a coffee in the Pollen Cafe you get free entry into the flower dome ( usually costs 16 Singapore dollars) The cloud dome is huge and impressive with many different unusual plants and a massive waterfall!
At night the whole place becomes magical with a light show from the 'trees' to music twice each evening.
There is also a small kiddies water park with jets of water spraying - no pool but there are changing facilities. There are various sculptures dotted around the park some of which are quite thought provoking.
There is also plenty of places to eat and drink, even a macdonalds, and gift shops.
Access to the gardens is easy being approx 20 minute walk from the cruise ship terminal or by underground train (MRT) to ' Bayfront' station.
No visit to Singapore would be complete without at least a day spent here!",,
,,Great place for family. Free and no entrance fees,5,,This is a big space where u can bring your family for a walk. There is a free water park near satay by the bay/eating place. U can download bike app and cycle around the place too!,,
,,The Jewel in the Crown that is the Garden City of Singapore.,5,,"Gardens by the Bay sits on the south shore of the Marina Bay, down Marina Gardens Drive, an oasis of calm surrounded by stately old buildings and swanky new skyscrapers of the city skyline. The jewel in the crown of Singapore鈥檚 evolving garden city development.

A spectacular fusion of art and science contributed by renowned consultants, the gardens sit on over 100 hectares of virgin reclaimed land and were realised at a cost of around one billion local dollars. It features two gargantuan glass and steel conservatories, a grove of tree-inspired structures and several outdoor zones beautifully laid out with water and rock features amid lush plantings of show trees, palms, ferns and shrubs from around the world.

The main attractions are:

1. The Flower Dome, one of the two stupendous greenhouse conservatories, featuring a central floral meadow ringed by terraced planting beds showcasing specimens representative of California, South America, South Africa, Australia, the Mediterranean, among others. The usual suspects are here 鈥?tulips, orchids, hibiscus, ferns, cacti. And the unexpected 鈥?huge baobab with outsized bulbous trunks, and thousand-year-old olive trees.

2. The Cloud Forest, the other giant conservatory, which houses a conical central core draped in verdant vegetation to mimic a mountain top from which protrude two levels of twisting aerial walkways, the higher one giving you the feeling of floating on clouds and the other skimming over tree tops, appropriately dubbed the Cloud and the Treetop Walks respectively. Located on the entrance side is a towering waterfall that saturates the air with a fine, cooling mist simulating mountain air.

3. The Supertree Grove, a cluster of gigantic tree-forms with spreading canopies, that turn into a romantic fairyland at night complete with music and light shows.

4. The Skyway, a 128m long walkway, suspended 22m above ground, and running in a wide arc through the Supertree Grove to connect two of the lofty trees. This offers awesome views of the surrounding gardens and beyond.

5. Besides the Supertree Grove there are other open air attractions such as The Canyon, Dragonfly and Kingfisher Lake, World of Plants, Heritage Gardens differentiated with Chinese, Malay, Indian and Colonial stylistic touches, and the Sun Pavilion, each sector with its own gems waiting to be discovered.

6. There are also some 40 sculptures of various sizes and styles set among the displays indoors and out, accentuating the mood in each venue.

7. The wide dining options from fastfoods to fine cuisine, in particular the ever popular local satay of grilled meat on a stick, dipped in piquant peanut sauce and washed down with lime juice or beer.

,,You have to go and visit!!!,5,,"We first came here in 2013 on our honeymoon, and thought we would revisit it again on our 5th anniversary holiday.

As it fell within the Chinese New Year period, the flower dome was even more colourful and well worth a visit. We spent an hour there and we could have spent even more time - it was wonderful being in the air-conditioned dome!!

It is reasonably priced and a must see if you are in Singapore.",,
,,Absolutely stunning day and night,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is a must see and do when in Singapore.
Most of this is a free attraction including the night lights to music show but it is worth paying the relatively low cost to get into the cloud dome. I didn't think the flower dome was as interesting as most of the plants were things I knew or had at home, but still worth a visit if you have time.
Best time of day is to be at the gate at opening time as it is less crowded and you can look around easily and take photos without other people in the way. By 11am the crowds have built up and it is noisy and harder to get around.
Personally I would go on 2 separate days and do the Cloud Dome one day and the Flower Dome another.
The music / light show changes daily so worth going more than once - esp. as its free.",,
,,Great place for all visitors and local residents,5,,One of the spot you should not miss in your trip to Singapore regardless you are here for leisure or business.,,
,,Gardens,5,,The best experience in Singapore. Spent the whole day watching the flowers and trees from whole world.,,
,,Worth going!,5,,"The rainforest dome was particularly interesting but the place was very crowded. It鈥檚 a must go if you鈥檙e in Singapore for a visit but try to avoid weekends, public holidays and local school holidays.",,
,,WOW,4,,a very nice place to go to if you are visiting SG. you can spend youe afternoon-evening time here as there are light show at night. Enter the domes for your viewing pleasure. Though I suggest to have a strong resistance as you will walk and walk and walk :),,
,,Absolutely breathtaking,5,,Between the cloud city and the flower dome and the super grove light show in the evening this place took our breath away. Simply must do,,
,,nice place to walk around for a few hours,5,,"the Gardens is a nice place to spend a few hours, amazing to see plus its all for free, so you can just walk around, without any cost",,
,,Gardens by the Bay !,5,,"Excellent location. Greenery all round; nice views , rain shower for kids ; nice walk ways ; Nice places to sit and enjoy the nature.",,
,,Cool and beautiful,5,,"I am a local and I have visited the gardens during different special featured events such tulips blooming, Halloween, Spring. Besides the usual exhibits, the gardens also allowed me to enjoy my favourite flowers without having to travel far. The flower dome environment is cool and comfortable. Furthermore, I read that it's self sustainable. So cool.",,
,,excellent collection of plants and flowers,4,,There are 3 conservatories to visit with each having its own entry price. There is a common park which is free. We visited only flower dome but the cloud forest appeared better from outside. They have an amazing collection of flowers and plants from all over the world. worth a visit. Do not miss the light show that happens in the evening. There are 2 shows and it's amazing. Do not miss it. Gather sometime before the show at it gets crowded in the area below the trees with lights,,
,,Holiday,5,,"It was a memorable experienced to came to the best tourist spot here in Singapore. One of the best city that I鈥檝e travelled. Respectful and disciplined staff.
I would highly recommend to all travelers to visit the most spectacular engineering designs of Gardens by the Bay. A+++",,
,,Affordable food at Satay By the Bay,5,,"The area is one of the most expensive in Singapore, but venture deeper through the Gardens and find affordable and delicious local hawker fare. The place is full of local foodies, which attests to the quality of the food there.",,
,,Very nice Xmas spirit,5,,A must go for families with young children. My kids enjoyed those funfair rides and rhe food selection.,,
,,Amenities,4,,Not enough public buses to reach there resulting some inconvenience to go there. Walking distance from the current MRT station to the Marina Barrage is quite far.,,
,,Loved it,5,,"I loved it so much I went back.
Satay by the bay is amazingly tasty and cheap. My fussiest child even ate there. If I had more time I鈥檇 go back and just keep sampling food from every vendor until I had eaten everything and given myself obesity and heart disease. Worth it.",,
,,Best place to enjoy with family,5,,I had gone with family for Saturday night visit and enjoyed the trip. Will be going again next month.,,
,,Make sure you see the gardens,5,,"One of the positives about visiting Gardens by the bay is that it doesn't have to cost you money. You can wander around and enjoy beautiful, well kept gardens and exhibits. We did the sky walk and the indoor waterfall/exhibits and the value was well worth it. I would encourage everyone to visit Gardens by the Bay.",,
,,Great experiencing nature from around the world,5,,"I gotta be honest - I was extremely against this monstrosity initially. Why build an aircon garden in a garden city in the tropics right? But I can see the ambition of the project now, and that it is a carbon neutral project.

I joined as a member and now I go every month to check out the new exhibits or just get away from the hustle and bustle of the City. It鈥檚 a great place to walk or relax, but you probably wanna avoid public holidays.

I鈥檝e noticed obnoxious tourists groups who just shove their way around and poke you with their selfie sticks, so it would be good if the management could do some public education before admitting large tour groups.",,
,,we were with our relatives who visited us from Chennai. They were totally exited to see,5,,OCBC walk is interesting to go. Lighting show in the evening worth to watch. Walking to the attraction through the glass tunnel is wonderful,,
,,Garden outside Eden...,4,,The best part of the garden is free n the night walk there is the best with the dazzling lights n cool Breeze ...u might want to pay n walk the canopy walk but there's really no need...enjoy n soak in the moonlights ...n beautiful sight,,
,,Nice place to visit,5,,The venue is wonderful and also a great place to see at night when they have a light show. Very large place and a lot of people visits it. I guess the downside is the high number of tourists that flocks the park.,,
,,A Wonder....Man Made...but still a Wonder,5,,"A must visit for everyone who visits Singapore. Whether you have an hour or hours, this is an amazing place to visit to enjoy nature in air conditioned comfort. Singapore does not have many of such natural wonders but surely this is one of the best man made wonders in the world.",,
,,Beautiful,4,,"The plantings are spectacular. Take a long, meandering walk through the gardens - but only in the early morning or early evening, avoid the heat of the day at all costs. Stop at the Satay-by-the-Bay hawker centre (food court) for local cuisine - the roti prata stall is well above average. (But write to the PUB and tell them to fix the water features at the barrage, it's an embarrassment.)",,
,,Wonderful construction,4,,Fabulous innovation and environmental experimentation and land use focussing on 21st century and tourist magnet,,
,,Soaking in the nature,5,,"Living in Mumbai does not give one an opportunity to be with the nature. One would not expect that Singapore would be any different. Consistently Singapore has been able to pull surprises. This garden is one such unexpected Marvel. In heart of the city, you get to instantly feel that you are away from all the concrete of endless buildings and tar of the roads and vehicles.

What a collection of plants, trees, shrubs, flowers. Sound of water, truly relaxing. Time permitting, will be back. These kind of things should not be ticketed. But then not everyone is not as generous as the morning sunrise and evening sunset.",,
,,nice place,5,,"the domes are a must go, with different themes replicating the different seasons. Certainly a place for instagrammers",,
,,Interesting Place to be,4,,I like the spacious huge garden in the day and the lights in the evenings. You need a whole day there just to relax and walk around. I like how there is engineering as well as nature all at 1 place.,,
,,Scenery and dining location,4,,"Huge garden with wide range of plants and many restaurants. located near central singapore, easily accessible by the local transport system. best to visit in the evening during sunset.",,
,,Best botanical!,5,,"What a pleasure to visit both the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest! Added bonus is the cool and humid environment, which is a welcome relief to Singapore鈥檚 tropical climate.",,
,,The best free time in Singapore,5,,"Great day out. Beautiful, enchanting and educational. Lots to walk around. I would recommend the Cloud Forrest indoor mountain and waterfall but less so the Flower Dome. These are both huge glass domes creating growing space for regional flora.

The flower dome whilst different in design is similar to the Kirstenbosch, Captown gardens or Kew Gardens in London. The Cloud Forest is however unique in a global scale.

Stay for the light and music show at 7:45pm.",,
,,So much to see,5,,"We called in here on a flying visit. I wish we had more time to look around. We bought tickets to both the domes. The Cloud Dome is amazing and a very good place to cool down. There is much more to see than I initially realised and I could have spent much more time in this dome. Then we went to the Flower Dome but we left it too late and the sun was going down by the time we were half way through. I was disappointed to rush this dome. The light show was amazing.
Just wish I had more time to explore the outside section of the gardens and also the Flower Dome. I will be back for sure !",,
,,A must visit place to see when you're in Singapore.,5,,The best time to visit is in the afternoon going to the evening time. The place is huge and you'd feast your eyes( would be taking lots of pictures/ selfies is a normal reaction to this place) on every turn. If you love nature/ flowers/art works you'd feel so at home. The collection of different plant/ flower species is huge.,,
,,Phenomenal green house.,5,,A great way to spend half a day in Singapore. The greenhouses are excellent and the evening show is phenomenal.,,
,,Beautiful gardens and flowers!,5,,"These gardens were so beautiful. The flower dome had so many flowers from all over the world! The cloud forest had so many green plants, waterfalls and statues. This place is a must see when in Singapore!",,
,,Unbelievable,5,,The Gardens By The Bay are truly unbelievable. Everytime you turned a corner you saw another amazing sight. We would thoroughly recommend taking the Buggy tour as you will see everything and have everything explained to you. It really is well worth going to,,
,,Epic,5,,Simply one of the most beautiful and visually stunning days of my life. You absolutely have to visit if you are in Singapore. The cloud dome is mesmerising and captivating. The flower dome breathtaking. The gardens which are free to visit are totally worth a visit too. If you have little kids bring towels and swim wear as the aqua splash zone is amazing for kids.,,
,,Fabulous Conservatories,5,,"Gardens by the Bay are a great attraction in Singapore. The outdoor gardens are free and very well done. The conservatories, though, require admission but they are amazing. The Flower Dome is wonderful but the Cloud Forest is jaw-dropping, with its 7 story high waterfall. Even my partner, who has no interest in plants, had a great time and would cheerfully return. It is not cheap but we both felt it was well worth the expense.",,
,,Excellent Gardens,5,,The gardens and domes are fantastic. Every plant you can think of can be found in the grounds and the two domes which include an amazing inside waterfall. There are buggys to take you round the gardens etc. Well worth a visit.,,
,,Fabulous,4,,"Amazing attraction, loved it. Definitely worth the entrance for the 2 domes but also recommend wandering around the outside gardens. The were beautiful & quiet, I don't know why more people don't wander around them.",,
,,Splendid place to wander and sit. It鈥檚 super.,5,,"Lovely gardens to wander around at any time of day. Completely free to access and open until 2 am. Can get crowded on a weekend evening or public holidays but you can lose the crowds if you choose a different day or avoid the super tree grove. You should see the grove though, just go on a Monday evening! Easy to get to by MRT to Bayfront, or a manageable walk from the city, via the Marina Bay Sands hotel walkway.",,
,,Absolutely stunning,5,,"Visited in Feb and was blown away by the stunning flower displays. Coming from the UK it was strange to see daffodils and tulips in bloom next to dahlias, one of our summer flowering plants. The displays were colourful and great to see. The cloud forest and the mountain was amazing to see also. The inspiration behind all we saw certainly made me think about our planet and what the future holds. If you see nothing else in Singapore this is well worth a visit.",,
,,Stunning place!,4,,Love it here. A definite have to see place when visiting. The gift shop is really disappointing tho but not a deal breaker.,,
,,Love this place,5,,"I paid $28 SGD for entry to both domes and got a free ticket for the OCBC Walkway. My vertigo, unfortunately prevented me from giving it a go! The Flower Dome while pleasant, never particularly grabs me and I have to say the so called Dazzling Dahlia exhibition disappointed me. The Cloud Dome though. Phenomenal, Breathtaking, Unbelievable. What more can you say about it? Fantastic.",,
,,Blown away!!,5,,"Magical!! Surreal!! The gardens by the bay, the flower dome, cloud forest, the garden rhapsody light show. Was completely blown away. Carry warm clothes. Be prepared to walk. Carry a camera for frame worthy pictures and brace yourself for a walk through a fantasy garden of flowers, displays, waterfalls, mist!! Oh yes and swimwear for the kids in the water play area.. my kids and I will never forget the sights today!!",,
,,Amazing place,5,,Really awesome place . We had a lot of fun there . We enjoyed there very much. very natural. and remarkable .,,
,,Truly wondrous,5,,"Gardens by the Bay - a truly wondrous and futuristic place with man made trees that are lit up at night in a dazzling light show. The trees though are planted from base to the start of the branches with real plants and they look stunning.
The park overall has some gardens which you pay to get into, a tram service to get you about, stunning gardens to wander around with gorgeous stainless steel sculptures in the fountain ponds. It is really calm and is behind the Marina Bay Sands Hotel.
The evening light show is amazing and takes place at 7.45 and 8.45 and it is advisable to get there a good 30 鈥?45 minutes early to get a good place to sit on the benches or stone troughs, especially if you want to take photos.
The Circle Line MRT is right at the entrance as well so it is easy to get to.",,
,,impresive,5,,great way to spend an afternoon. We had a lovely afternoon walsking around the various gardens. Well worth a visit when visiting Singapore,,
,,very good,5,,This is so pretty. I was advised to get to the Domes around 5 to allow a couple of hours to go round them. I then went straight to the Tree area to the large food hall to eat and wait for the light show at 7.45. If you want to go round the garden area itself I'd allow a further hour to hour & half for that. well worth the visit.,,
,,Visit twice,5,,"February 2018. Visited Singapore and a must to visit was the Gardens by the Bay. We walked from our hotel near Raffles, a good walk but I like to see what is around and it is all quite safe. Entrance to the park itself is free, but you pay to go into the two domes, cloud forest and flower dome. Both of these take a couple of hours total and we did them in the afternoon when they were quite quiet. I can imagine at peak summer time it would be crowded and space would be limited. Our second visit was at night to see the light show at the Supertrees, this is a free outdoor show to music illuminating the artificial trees. The show started as full darkness came and lasted about 15 minutes. There is a walkway between the supertrees, you pay for this and access is timed and limited. Overall well worth a visit.",,
,,Fantastic,4,,Huge garden and need to spend a full day to explore everything. Love the lights in the evenings. Sad that we couldn't spend enough time here to visit the dorms,,
,,Gardens By The Bay,5,,"Excellent, beautiful experience. The 2 canopies are outstanding with natural fauna. Clean and well served with all necessary amenities.",,
,,Must seen in Singapore,5,,Really nice visit to see in Singapore. If you can don鈥檛 miss Rapsody Garden by the Bay occurring every day at 7:45pm and 8:45pm. Light and music show are magical!,,
,,Don't miss it,5,,These gardens are a wonder - worth a trip to Singapore in themselves. Bayside MRT station. Don't bother with the $3 shuttle bus. You can walk easily and in very little time to the various amazing features of the Gardens.,,
,,Amazing,5,,"Beautiful place to visit for those who love flowers , gardens from all over the world. Great to spend the day inside the domes and keep cool. Wear good walking shoes to walk around the outside of the domes . Quite pricey but worth the trip.",,
,,"Visited it at dawn to experience the light and music shows, was delighted with the visit",5,,"Amazing experience, particularly the Forest in the Clouds, amazing experience of a rainforest and the largest indoor waterfall. You must make it.",,
,,Needs time to mature,3,,"We went up the trees, but it was too busy to go in the glasshouses. Since it has only recently been created it was a bit raw - I should think it will improve with time.",,
,,Underwhelmed,3,,"Made an evening visit to see the light show. I can see the attraction, but personally I was underwhelmed.",,
,,Must visit,5,,"Enjoy man made wonder, fine collection of flora from different parts of the world. Inspiring architecture and enhanced sustainability. Large expanse for a leisurely stroll in early morning or evening .",,
,,Great!,5,,Loved the gardens the most. Incredible planting and amazing birds and views. Would come back again. Good,,
,,A Unique Place,5,,"I鈥檓 not sure if there is any place like this in the world, and it is definitely worth the visit. You can enter the grounds for free and watch the light show on the trees at night. We tried to pay for the self-driving cart, but they were all booked up for the day.",,
,,Like no other gardens,5,,We had no idea what to expect here but were blown away by the architecture as much as the plants. The Cloud Forest with its waterfall was awesome. Don't visit Singapore without coming to see this,,
,,Beautiful display,5,,We did the cloud forest & flower dome and enjoyed both. A wonderful way to see plants & flowers close up. It was also a welcome reprieve from the heat.,,
,,Amazing flowers,5,,The flowers are beyond words. Ive been here twice and it never ceases to amaze me to marvel at God鈥檚 creation.,,
,,Delightful Gardens,5,,"Now, I have to admit, I am generally not the type of person that visits gardens on my vacation. But Gardens By the Bay has a variety of fauna, art, wood carvings, Lego sculptures to keep everyone entertained. We walked around for a few hours admiring the beautiful plants, and the gigantic tree statues. Even more impressive when you realized that these gardens were created from reclaimed land from the ocean..

Through the gardens are LEGO replicas of trees, orchids and plants....very well done!",,
,,Picturesque,5,,The flower dome had many interesting plants inside. The place looks magical at night with the beautiful lights and a nice view of the river and the Marina Bay Sands.,,
,,Good for see around Singapore.,5,,"In my think, flower doom and cloud forest is very good. Waterfall is very awesome. And flower doom. Um.. that place is good tour course which is couple. Enjoy your holiday!",,
,,Great place to see,5,,Great place to see . One of the wonderful things in Singapore Easy access with MRT. Best time to visit here is early in the evening when the lights are on. Plan for a couple hours including visiting nearby attractions. Definitely a place to visit,,
,,Ok,3,,It's big and pretty but nothing to write home about. But probably good for families who are on vacation. It's also too hot to walk around for a long time for.,,
,,Futuristic Garden Marvel,5,,"Extensive themed gardens that are fascinating for all ages of the family. So much to do, see and learn. Beautifully laid out gardens with a backdrop of modern architecture. It really is a wonder venture for the 21st century.",,
,,Impressive,5,,A very clean spacious area that takes atleast two days to grasp the magnitude and beauty of this location. If in Singapore your trip would not be complete if you do not spend time there.,,
,,Unbelievable,5,,"Went at night to see the light show and it was mind blowing. Went back next day to see it in daylight , the whole place is stunning",,
,,Take the Time to See This Site,5,,"Not your ordinary garden, sculpted grounds, electric lights, or even tourist spot.
This beautifully designed project is a sight to behold. Plan to stroll and take your time to see the orchids, the waterfall, and the unusual sculpted trees.
Cost is not cheap and the walking is a must.....but worth it! Singapore should be proud...and they are!",,
,,The best place for visit in Singapore!,5,,Locate at Marina Bay is Garden by the Bay in Singapore! The place is wonderful and the metal architeture in flowers format is gorgeous! Buy the ticket to climb (elevator) to a bridge that joins 2 of the biggest architectures to take photos and observe from above the beauty of the gardens and place. The night is unforgettable to visit with show of lights and sounds. Unmissable.,,
,,Beautiful,5,,"Huge garden complex very close to Marina Bay Sands. I didn't have time to enter the domes, so only explored the outdoor portion, which is free, which is always nice. There weren't a lot of flowers in the outdoor area, just loads of plants. The highlight are these gigantic tree-like statues. At night, they light up beautifully and reminded me of the movie Avatar.

Around 20:30 every night, there is a light and sound show, where the tree statues change colour in time with the music. Everyone leaves afterward for the MRT, so be prepared for some crowds. Buy a return ticket from your originating station to avoid the long ticket queues.",,
,,"Beautiful and a must see, but very busy",4,,"We arrived in the afternoon after lunch.
This is very busy place and lots of tourist everywhere
I thought the gardens were a bit over priced but all air conditioned so nice to walk around.
Sky walk was ok as well but they try and get you up and down again but great views once up there and priced ok.",,
,,"Very, very good",5,,"I really enjoyed my visit in this beautiful garden. It鈥檚 very well designed, cared for and the entry is free of charge. Very happy.",,
,,Beautiful garden - go at night and see light show,4,,"These are beautifully landscaped garden just by the harbour side. There is a useful shuttle - it鈥檚 a big site. We went in the evening and stayed for the8.45 light show. Plants and lights were terrific, though accompanied by some rather cheesy music, which lets the show down a little. Pityto miss this, though, if you have free time in Singapore.",,
,,Overrated and Overpriced ......,2,,"No doubt a great place but in my view ... the Botanics are better. We visited the Flower Dome and the Cloud Dome at $28 per person - the Flower Dome was a great collection of various flowers all in flower-pots, hardly a natural display and very busy: the cloud Dome was more interesting but again quite limited with the mountain clouds more a sprinkler system. Quite interesting but overpriced.

Maybe better at night but during the day the botanics are better.",,
,,Sorry. Found this place really disturbing.,3,,"Start off with the positives. The light show at night in the Supertree Grove was wonderful. These modern structures are beautiful forms, supporting a myriad of plants. The two large conservatories on site are just as stunning in their own way. I love plants and nature. The tropics are home to do many weird and wonderful plants. I bought a ticket for the Cloud Forest conservatory. Instead of seeing nature at its best, you are confronted the height of tackiness. Caught the elevator to the ""Lost World"". A display of carnivorous plants set amongst lego plants. My heart sunk. It did not get any better. People were taking selfies with all the plastic plants and fake styrofoam / plaster animals and insects, set in amongst the plants. I know they are also attempting to educate people about the environment, however do we really need to sell nature like it is a Disneyland?",,
,,beautiful,5,,"A nice place to spend a half day, walking around looking at plants and flowers in a very impressive setting.",,
,,Amazing!,5,,Despite very confusing ticketing arrangements and a multitude of disconnected buggy and audio tour options (am still not sure what we paid for and didn't) this is a place without parallel unless you are familiar with the film Avatar!! Go twice - day and night and make sure you visit the Cloud Dome and the OCBC sponsored sky walk and experience the light show in Supertree Grove - mind blowing!,,
,,Nice place.,5,,"This is a nice place to visit early in the morning or late afternoon, when the weather is cooler. If you want to see the light show, have to be there by 7;30 pm. I will recommend only visiting the free part, I visited the forest dome and it was ok but not as good as the park itself. Since it is very close to Marina Bay sands, which electra show is at 8 pm and 9 pm on weekdays, you can do both the same night. Then go for a walk towards esplanade, nice walk and amazing views while crossing the bridge.",,
,,Just breathtakingly excellent,5,,"It just blew my mind on how much thought, planning, construction went into this wonderful park. You gotta see it at night as well.",,
,,Amazing,5,,"I knew my wife and two daughters would enjoy this but I didn't expect to. I was wrong, probably the best thing we visited in Singapore.",,
,,Relaxing,5,,Very pretty area and relaxing to walk around and enjoy. Make sure to bring comfortable shoes! Just very pretty to take in the scenery.,,
,,Worth the entrance,5,,i am very much amazed at this attraction in SG. worth every single penny and would definitely be back,,
,,Singapore 2018,4,,Spent a couple of hours walking through these amazing indoor and outdoor gardens. Ideally you need 1/2 day realistically to appreciate this beautiful place .,,
,,Riot of colours,5,,"Specially with the extra decorations for Chinese New Year, the exhibits were phenomenon. Well maintained and great plants",,
,,Make the time,5,,Best to visit late afternoon and then stay on to view the light show . Even the eating places are good value,,
,,Enlightening and educational afternoon,5,,We spent 4 hours in the Gardens admiring the design elements and the awesome plant exhibitions. The flowers and displays were breath taking. The prices were full value for money and the facilities were world class. We then had cocktails on top of the Marine Sands next door. A unique and worthwhile destination.,,
,,Bazza,4,,The indoor waterfall dome was excellent! Flower garden was also worth a visit ! Lovely day out ! Best to go early evening as there is a light display at dusk,,
,,Another world!,5,,"Wow, this place is space and amazing! So modern and natural in the same time! They did a real great job there, it's enchanting, daytime and even more on nightime! Worth the visit even if you don't spend any money, there's a lot to see for free. Nice place to telax, to walk, take pictures, take fresh air, spend time with family and friends, really cool ambiance! The musical and lightning show at night is great! You just feel that you are now in the future or on another planet!
And you are close to a lot of other great attractions to visit around! We would go there often if we were living in Singapore!",,
,,Very interesting but a little overblown,4,,"We enjoyed our time here at the Cloud Forest. There are some interesting exhibits, but personally I found the Botanic Gardens and the Zoo more interesting.",,
,,Amazing! A must do,5,,"For the super tree grove alone this would get 5 stars, day or night and especially during the light show at quarter to every hour during the evening. I loved it! Also loved the cloud forest biome which we visited at night - spectacular! Flower biome less so but still really interesting and air conditioned too. Love the manicured gardens which you can stroll around for free with the backdrop of the city and the Marina Bay Sands hotel. A must do easy to access on the MRT with a great walk though from the Marina Bay mall which has a fab food court and crystal fountain which you can project your choice of effect through the WiFi.",,
,,Must watch the lightshow!,4,,able to run there for the lightshow last minute. No regret as it was amazing. sitting at the water fountain can enjoy the good view for 'wide angle view' but music wasnt cover that much in the area,,
,,Fantastic Gardens,5,,You can stroll through the gardens free of charge or pay to visit the two enclosed gardens. Well worth a visit,,
,,fabulous well worth a visit,5,,"i booked our tickets on line before we went and i cant believe how cheap it is ( approx 拢10)
the indoor |Domes are like big garden centres but with some amazing features like the indoor waterfall.
once it was coming to evening we found a seat in the park and settled in for the garden light show...was very surprised that this is a feature that does not cost anything to see! it was beautiful :-).

the only downside for us was the food available...we didnt enjoy it at all and if went again would take a picnic with us.
would certainly recommend visiting here if you are going to singapore",,
,,A visual treat!,5,,The Cloud Forest experience makes me wish for a better vocabulary to adequately describe how much I enjoyed my visit. The Flower dome was also very impressive but so many people jockeying for positions in capturing selfies was first entertaining and then distracting. Overall the indoor gardens were a highlight of the trip.,,
,,Nice,4,,Nice place to view and relax especially family enjoyed a lot.night time I visited and with the lighting's it's more good view,,
,,Watch the show at 7:45pm!,5,,"I walked over with friends around 6:30pm. The Gardens are free so it鈥檚 a wonderful, cheap thing to do in Singapore. It gave us plenty of time to walk around, enjoy the beautiful gardens and find a great spot to watch the light show that starts promptly at 7:45pm.

We didn鈥檛 pay for the walking plank between the bridges. Although affordable, $8, they only allow a certain amount of people on at once so then you end up having to wait until people come down before you can go up.

They also have a bar at the top of one of the trees that seemed cool for $20 and that includes a drink once you鈥檙e up there.

Definitely a must see when in Singapore!",,
,,Gardens by the Bay how to get there,5,,"MRT to Bayfront this gets you to the back end as I call it then over the Dragon Bridge and your there info centre is in the middle. The front entrance is by blue line Downtown get off and onto bus 400 and check it is going to Marina Gardens Drive this bus only does the loop. Pay the entrance fees into the Domes far superior to anything you will see anywhere else. This complex owned by the Government that's why only small charges apply, the Gardens were paid off in 5yrs hence why they can afford to keep updating them.",,
,,Oh my Gosh,5,,"Oh my God, no wonder why is world鈥檚 touristic hotspot, it is just once in a lifetime experience, one more time.. OMG",,
,,"Amazing Gardens, but Crowded and Long Lines",4,,"I just wanted preface my review by saying I went during the lunar new year on a weekend and it was jam packed!

The gardens were spectacular! I checked out the flower dome, cloud forest, and the supertrees sky walk. All were spectacular and there is a lot going on within the park as well as various performances. I went on a saturday and although it was amazing, it was somewhat ruined by the sheer number of people.

The Flower Dome wait wasn't long (maybe like 10 mins), but there are so many people taking pictures inside, it's hard to get your own pictures and also you're constantly walking in the path of someone else trying to take a picture. The entire dome is air conditioned and beautifully decorated. It's very nice being able to appreciate the display without the oppressive heat. But other than goofing off a bit taking silly pictures, I don't think I can spend too much time looking at flowers and plants, but it took us a while to get through because of the crowds.

The Cloud Forest line during the day was loooooong. They even stopped selling tickets because the line was approaching 1.5 hours. We purchased the cloud forest ticket despite the ticket vendor warnings. We jumped in line at the end of the night about an hour before they closed and only waited about 20 mins. This dome is also air conditioned but after already spending 3 hours at the park, we weren't really in the mood to appreciate the displays to their entirety. We just went up the elevator and walked down relatively quickly the winding sky bridges that lead down.

There were some chinese new year performances including lion dances, contortionists, and other performances, but they were soooo crowded and we didn't feel like fighting through for a viewing spot.

By this time, it was fairly late and we were tired and hungry so we didn't walk the sky walk at the super trees. I came back the next day by myself to check it out. I'm guessing the most awesome time to be on the sky bridge is at about 7pm when the sun sets, the lights go on, and there is a little song and light show. So of course the line is the longest at this time. I was by myself and refreshed from the previous day, so I didn't mind playing on my phone as I waiting 1-1.5 hours to get up the skywalk at this time. It was awesome on top with the views and the lights. I probably stayed up there for about 30 minutes just relaxing. They don't pressure very much to head down only if you're in the narrow part of the bridge.

All in all, a good experience, but I wouldn't go back on a crowded day again. Also it's a bit pricy for the domes so I probably wouldn't go back in there, but a lot to checkout in the park is free and very beautiful.",,
,,Lovely colorful place for taking pictures,5,,"If you like pretty colorful flowers, plants, this is the place that you don't want to miss. Plus it is air-conditioned, couldn't be better. I hate walking but didn't have any problem going up and down and around. There are plenty of sitting areas.",,
,,Must do in Singapore,5,,We were in Singapore for a week and didn't make time to do the Gardens by the Bay. We went back for one more day before leaving the area and spent half a day just on the grounds and walking through the waterfall building. Just amazing! we should have saved more time to do it all.,,
,,A must visit!,5,,I would definitely recommend visitors to this popular spot. It is worth a visit to this manicured air conditioned enclosed garden. Love the plants and flowers!,,
,,Have a lot of fun...,5,,Very lovely moment we had passed there. An amazing place. Remarkable service. It was really awesome ..,,
,,Underwhelmed,4,,"On a previous visit to Singapore, we spent some time walking around the gardens, which we thoroughly enjoyed.

On this occasion, we paid to enter the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. I'm afraid we found then a little boring, because many of the plants are those we are familiar with in the UK. We also found it rather strange that there are so many plastic ""Plants"", which spoil the natural effect. Clearly, from the reviews here, we are in the minority. Nevertheless the whole of the gardens are nicely laid out and they make a very pleasant escape from the hustle and bustle of Singapore.

The OCBC Skyway is probably more of an experience, due to the height of the walkway.",,
,,Unmissable if you go to Singapore - an amazing environment,5,,Been to the Gardens in the Bay twice in the last year - and each time I've been blown away by what I've seen and experienced. There is something to see every part of the year but it evolves all the time. You'll see flowers and plants that bloom at different times of the year - all in bloom at the same time in man cases. Amazing!,,
,,Beautiful,5,,"Make sure you get to the gardens in time for the light show, an absolute must and not to be missed. Recommended.",,
,,Glorious gardens,5,,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to this attraction. It was amazing, so colourful and well maintained with so much to see. Well organised and laid out attraction. Everywhere you looked there was something different to see. A must when visiting Singapore !",,
,,SO SO BEAUTIFUL,4,,"We ended up visiting the gardens by the bay three times on our 8 day stay in Singapore.
The first time we went there we saw the night show which was so whimsical and definitely a must do. We were too late to go into the cloud forest though ( last ticket sold 7:30), so we made a point to come back another day. When we came back though the place was soo soo busy and we didn't pre purchase tickets (highly recommend otherwise lines to get tickets alone can be over 30mins).
When we finally returned we pre purchased tickets it was the start of Chinese new year and a Saturday ,so the place was busy but the line to pick up pre purchased tickets was a quarter of the size of non purchased tickets. We lined up to go into the cloud forest and the line moved quickly. The waterfall upon entry is amazing. The longest line whilst inside was for the elevator but you can bypass this if you are willing to climb the stairs, which aren't bad and you pass a lot of people.
After this you can go and check out the flower dome, sadly we ran out of time as we had a flight to catch.
We'd strongly recommend allowing a lot of time to take it all in and get a lot of great shots, as it is very busy.",,
,,Visit it in the evening,4,,"I really loved Gardens by the Bay. I believe that it was one of the best moments of my trip.
In the afternoon we visited the Cloud and Flower Domes. At 19.45 a show with music and lights started. It only lasts about one quarter of an hour, but I recommend it.",,
,,Entrance fees are too high,3,,"From the outside the architecture looks great, but the interior landscape and flower arrangements do not look good. Also, the entrance fees are too high.",,
,,Great Light Show.,5,,"The forest comes alive with a multi-color light show at dusk. Handicapped friendly, though a bit crowded.",,
,,Family trip,5,,Very good place to visit with kids.Lot of attractions and the cold forest was major attraction and my son enjoyed the place.,,
,,Dont ho at Chinese NewYear,5,,"A great place to visit, divided into flowers and plants from each country. Beautifully kept and very interesting. Unfortunately, we visited at Chinese NewYear when the gardens were full of families all wanting to have their photos taken at the exhibits we wanted to see. Made for a frustrating time!",,
,,Stunning,5,,This is a modern wonder of the world and a must do on any stay in Singapore. It鈥檚 hot work walking about but WOW factor is everywhere. My highlight was the cloud forest walk. It鈥檚 a bit of a walk there so catch the MRT (tube) if you want to save energy for walking about when there.,,
,,Wow factor,5,,Truly amazing view whilst enjoying a cocktail. Excellent friendly service. Food looked very good too. It should be on everyone's to do list.,,
,,Wonderful place to visit,5,,First time in Singapore & we were so blown away with the beauty of Gardens by the Bay.We walked around the gardens for a few hours even though it was very hot & humid. The gardens & plants were so beautiful. we returned at night & the night show was spectacular. A must see when in beautiful modern Singapore.,,
,,Must see when in Singapore,5,,What a great day/evening out. Gardens by the Bay is a must see when in Singapore. take the 10 min walk to sate by the bay to eat some great food away from the crowds.,,
,,nice escape,5,,"Went to Gardens of the bay in the evening for the evening show at supertree grove. In the evening was really nice as temperature was pleasant and walk in the gardens was beautiful. The show was interesting, but expected more. Was something new for me, is worth ed to visit it.",,
,,One of the major highlights of our Singapore trip,5,,"The last time we were in Singapore in 2012, the Gardens by the Bay was not yet open. What an amazing and magnificent botanical multi-complex with plants from around the world. One can easily spend 4 or more hours here. If time and/or physical limitations are an issue, consider getting the reasonably priced audio tour which involves a 22-seat vehicle that goes around the complex. We had just landed in Singapore after a 17-hour flight and spent the afternoon at the Gardens, but were too tired to stay for the evening. The next time we go to Singapore, we plan to see the Gardens in the evening when the lights are on.",,
,,Truly impressive.,5,,"We only had a few hours and decided of all the things to do in Singapore, we visited Gardens by the Bay. The walkway above the gardens was truly impressive. Do this first thing in the morning before it becomes too busy and when it's not so hot and humid.",,
,,Incredible gardens,5,,Place is magnificent and charming. All well organized and high developed. Entrance is free until you want visit some particular areas.At night there is light show. Best attraction of Singapore.,,
,,Must see attraction,5,,So well-maintained and surprises around every corner. Beautiful diversity. Well worth the cost and able to accommodate crowds easily.,,
,,Well worth a visit,5,,"The 2 domes were great and plenty to see and do. A lot of walking but there's plenty of places to eat, drink and recover.",,
,,Must see,5,,Worth a visit especially the night show. requires a day at least to go round the glass green house. great views from the marina bay hotel,,
,,Feel the atmosphere of Avatar,5,,"we visited this place twice when it was light, the second time we decided to come when it would start to dim. It was a hit. everything got magic when the lights came on, the music was turned on and we watched the whole show from the pavement hanging between the two cosmic trees, amazing to recommend",,
,,Beautiful cloud forest and flower dome... a bit expensive though...,4,,"Singapore is this interesting place that can be quite appealing to some people and boring to others. In our case, we are undecided if we belong to the second group or to a group in the middle. Nevertheless, keep this in mind whilst reading my review.

Now... I need to give you a second warning. My reviews tend to be a tad long, so I am going to give you a way out a very short version of the review:

The Gardens have a lot of things: parks (quite pretty, well worth walking most of it even though the heat might challenge your mood), the supertree grove (weird concrete trees) host lots of plants but in reality are super smart/advance cooling towers for a power plant, finally you have the domes, both of them are interesting on their own; one has waterfalls and a sort of rainforest and the other one a huge amount of flowers (lots of orchids as well and plants from South America). Each dome has a price to get in and there are combined tickets making visiting the gardens a tad cheaper. That's the short review... next, a pretty long one. You can stop reading if you got enough information.

I see... you continued reading regardless of the warning at the top... so begin by saying:

Gardens by the Bay is a lot more than the cloud forest and the flower dome. It is a pretty big area covering parks, the power plant (or those weird tree shapes called Supertree groves) fueled by plant material that gets burnt, captured and returned to the environment, the two massive domes (glasshouses), a river (sort of) that goes through it from which you will get gorgeous photos of the Marina Bay Sands and flowers.

The Supertree Grove has a restaurant and a series of bridges connecting some of the trees (all of it has an entry fee) but it also has informative plates around telling you what is what and its functionality. I recommend you to look for it, is super cool for engineers, environmentalists and might be good for kids as well. In general, the info panels explain that Singapore can generate a lot of biomass that can be burnt to generate power... making this activity carbon neutral as you would be using the dead matter that captured carbon initially. Some of the newly produced CO2 is pumped into the domes to promote the growth of the forest, capture some of the moisture from the air before releasing it once more to the environment. Going back to the restaurant, the view from up there might be amazing, we did not go there as we had spent quite some money before coming here and wanted to reduce some of the expenses. Though, if you have $12 you might be able to go up and visit the skywalk (a series of bridges between the supertrees). Again, we did not go up the skywalk, mainly because my missus is afraid of heights, which is irrational as the bridges look pretty solid to me. In any case, I think a visit to the supertrees can be quite interesting and can be economical as there is plenty to see without paying the tickets to these attractions I have described above.

From the Supertrees, you could go towards the domes OR you can go towards the heritage gardens and the dragonfly (and something) river/lakes. We decided to walk towards these other gardens before going to the domes (as we thought it was going to be easier to go to public transport from the domes... this is not the case, so I will recommend you to visit the domes FIRST, AND come back to these other ones as the gardens are beautiful. Lots of statues and art disseminated around giving you the impression of being in one of the stories of Alice in Wonderland (even when you find the gigantic metallic dragonflies on the lake). Walking around these parts is super easy although it can be confusing as the winding path and the multiple construction sites (expanding the parks?) can leave you disorientated for a bit. Getting out of here is not too difficult, just walk towards the hotel and eventually you will find pointers telling you where to go.

I can not stress enough that these parts of the Gardens are gorgeous. Lots of flowers everywhere and nice spots to walk/rest whilst enjoying the view. But if you find that boring yet wants to get to know the Gardens, there is a set of golf karts going by every now and then, with a guide explaining all the different types of plants and vegetation on display. This latter one is a paid activity and we enjoyed a lot more walking around the Gardens.

From there, we walked back to the Supertrees (stopped for an ice cream at Maccas) and continued to the cloud forest dome and the flower dome. Each dome has a unique beauty, the cloud forest is a bit rawer in the sense that the artificial mountain/waterfall gives you the impression of an abstract natural world. The flower dome is a lot more organised with all the flowers and vegetation from different places around the world. I am not sure if the domes were worth the money we paid to get in but is not a super high fare to get in.

Unfortunately, the number of free things to see in Singapore is relatively limited and this one, based on its tourist attraction does not escape getting anything remotely interesting to be taxed with an entry fee. In total, you might expect to spend around 30 to 40 dollars per person if you want to see everything. If you want to go and money is one of your worries, walk around the gardens first, you will find plenty to do that is free, then move to those more attractive to you.",,
,,Great day out,5,,Especially perfect when the weather is oppressive; great displays and easy to take most of an afternoon / day,,
,,Dreamy and Beautiful,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is one stop which I never fail to visit together with friends from abroad. This place is the epitome of greenery within our city of skyscrapers. Tranquil, beautiful and dreamy, Gardens by the Bay is a recommended visit for everyone - young or old! Do stay to experience the spectacular garden rhapsody, it is worth braving the crowd for. The two domes require an entrance fee but you will never be disappointed - a horticultural delight, particularly during the festive seasons!",,
,,Different experience,3,,The cloud dome and flower dome are quite different from any garden you will see so it is good to be here.,,
,,Fun Run experience,4,,"I鈥檝e been on this place 4 yrs ago when we treated our son on a singapore trip for his birthday. It is part if our itinerary while staying at Sg. This time ,since me and my other colleague were staying in Marina Bay Sands, we capitalize to do the morning run for 3 days as it is quite enjoyable to have a green scenery and smell this botanical garden. It may sound funny but the area is too big to explore the area and would really have complete array of plants and flowers on it. Their set up is fascinating that conserving this raw floras is really admirable.",,
,,Seemed like just basic rainforest plants and flowers - the kind you see at Home Depot garden department,2,,"The day I was there, a corporate family day was taking place, and there were throngs of employees and their kids carrying balloons and wearing the same T-shirts, jamming the walkways and creating long lines to get in and out as they preened for selfies. Couldn't get near the waterfall or walkway. I felt I was the only person who paid to be there that day. The small sign when I came in to pay said, ""Today is Singel Family Day,"" when it should have read, ""Mobs of people inside. Hopelessly oversold!""

But, that's just one day. More interestingly, I felt like most of the plants on display here were just kind of familiar basic rainforest plants and flowers - the kind of stuff you see at Home Depot plant department - planted alongside concrete walkways. And then the fake giant sparkly pumpkins for fall. Bordering on tacky and the plants all were the kind that you see at every botanical garden/conservatory if you're in Cincinnati or Chicago or Milwaukee or wherever. You'd do much better going to the Botanic Gardens in Singapore.

Buildings are cool in a Disney-esque sort of way. It would be fun to have a few Singapore Slings and run there around one evening if you had the place to yourself.",,
,,Visit to Singapore,5,,"Wonderful time in a wonderful city. Best in the world. Sad to leave such a vibrant, welcoming city for the 20th time. Love it!",,

,,A great couple of hours in Singapore,5,,"Our family of 2 adults and 1 child (aged 11) visited Gardens By The Bay, and had a lovely time. The domes are well worth visiting, especially the one with the waterfall. There's a decent food court, and a restauarent we would have visited but was a walk away from the main attractions.
Also worth doing the walk in the sky for great views and photo opportunities,",,
,,A Must visit place,5,,While in Singapore you must visit this place and see this wonderful man made marble. There are so many things to see around.,,
,,School trip to GBTB,5,,I had a great time there as well as the children of course! It was easy for me to purchase the tickets via online with the helpful person from GBTB. :),,
,,World Class visitor facility,5,,"This was not in Singapore when I was last there in 2001, but what a credit to Singapore this facility is now. I was impressed with the spaciousness, variety of different attractions both inside air-conditioned domes and outside - especially the elevated tree walk. Easy to reach by MRT or Bus / Taxi. You will need at least an hour for each dome, and at least half hour for the tree walk and gardens. There are restaurant and bar facilities there or a short walk away at the nearby",,
,,An amazing attraction!,5,,"What more can I say but, Amazing! This is a must see attraction of you visit Singapore. And it's airconditioned inside the domes making you want to spend even time wandering around the exhibits.",,
,,Worth a visit,5,,A great display of plants and flowers well worth a visit. Try to book online to avoid queuing at the ticket office!,,
,,Just beautiful,5,,"Really enjoyed going to Gardens by the Bay. Beautiful scenery and lots of information.

Was lucky enough to see the light show and it was amazing. Knew I would like it, but didn鈥檛 realise how much I would find it so chilled even though there was so many people about just watching the show and enjoying.

Going back to Singapore this year and already planned to see it again.",,
,,What a great experience,5,,We visited the gardens in Feb 2018..It is all air conditions and great to walk around. This can be book fro your hotel and they give a discount for on line bookings . As part of your visit you can also visit cloud forest on the same entrance. Both are a must when you visit Singapore,,
,,Garden by the Bay,5,,One of my favorite place to visit. Beautiful and amazing collection of variety of flowers. If you visit Singapore and don't visit garden by the Bay. Your trip is incomplete.,,

,,Brilliant!!,5,,We walked around the gardens on a beautiful late afternoon and then stayed around for the light and sound show. We were not disappointed. It was sooooooo relaxing and ever so good.

,,Top attraction in Singapore,4,,"Excellent attraction , lots to see and do , recommend the treetop walk for the additional fee . Recommend going late afternoon so can see the light show as it goes dark",,
,,"""The place for tourists""",5,,It is filled with the supernatural nature. One recommendation is to go to the Flower Dome then go to the Cloud forest at about 6pm and watch the wonderful landscape of the colour-changing trees.,,
,,Worth a visit,4,,My husband and I went here for the weekend. It was kind of crowded and filled with tourists but overall it was very beautiful. Bring sun protection and the appropriate footwear since there will be a lot of walking! Will be bringing the kids next time for sure :),,

,,A great day out!,5,,Such a great venue in Singapore. We had a fabulous day visiting the domes and the garden. Worth the visit.,,
,,Awesome garden within the garden city,5,,"Singapore is well known to be the Garden City (just in case you didn't know that). Gardens by the bay is the crowd jewel to showcase the vast garden side of us.

While you may get to see other gardens elsewhere (as in other countries), this is a must go to place where you will be able to take your time and enjoy the vast beauty.

The 2 domes are also great place to check out. Well within air conditioned area, they showcase the various seasonal displays.

If you are around the area at night, do check out the music and light show at the giant tree area!",,
,,Eye candies at every corner,5,,"I totally love these gardens, the steel trees, the greenhouses, the curated outdoor gardens, everything is beautiful, it's like a tropical Alice in Wonderland quirky world.",,

,,Amazing place,5,,Lovely view in the night ... beautiful place... A worth visit ... the lighting can be seen in the night ..,,
,,Worth watching cloud forest & flower dome,4,,2 domes (cloud forest & flower dome) are excellent attractions. While super tree grove & ocbc skyway were not much attractive. Better to use the tram (paid service) there since the area coverage of garden by the bay is much larger,,
,,Amzing,5,,You must visit this amazing gardens especially the cloud dom it something special and amazing gardens.,,
,,Pleasant place to spend quality time.,5,,"The gardens have a paid option to enter the climate controlled domes and the (separate) aerial walkway, but the rest of the gardens are free to stroll around. There are plenty of different themed areas and open space. Access is normally by the bridge close to the Sands Hotel with an MRT station and bus stops, but other alternatives are walking from the marina via the Helix Bridge, or taking a 400 bus to near the Marina Barrage to get to the far corner.

There are numerous dining options, but we used 'Satay By The Bay' which is a hawker centre near the barrage, which sells not only satay, but also Indian and Chinese dishes. It is only slightly more expensive than city hawker centres, but can get very busy at weekend.

The evening highlights include a 15 minute sound and light show at 7:45pm and 8:45pm daily in Supertree Grove. The evening is the best time to stroll around when it is cooler, but drinking fountains are provided in the central area.

If you have travelled on Singapore Airlines, keep your boarding pass to get a discount on admission to the domes.",,
,,Beautiful Gardens,5,,"A visit to the gardens is a must whilst visiting the city. Beautiful plants, upside down trees and sculptures are enchanting. A great day out.",,
,,Mind blowing experience,5,,"An enjoyable walk through the various buildings and the grounds. That took some thinking to design, but also to create the various living exhibitions.",,
,,Disappointing,3,,After visiting the 鈥渂otanical gardens 鈥?in the morning and being very impressed with them this had a theme park feel to it and the flowers did not seem as good . The light show of the trees on the evening however was very impressive,,
,,Nice attraction,4,,"Beautiful gardens and attractions, nice and relaxing if not for all the tourists which obviously is expected for such a venue.",,
,,The most beautiful gardens and displays with a difference,5,,Well worth the trip and to spend several hours walking around. The two indoor areas are incredible and make for an interesting visit.,,
,,Such a unique travel experience!,5,,You have to go see all of the amazing buildings and features in this particular area of Singapore! Recommended!!!,,
,,Totally amazing,5,,Another Must See when in Singapore. An amazing creation of a garden. Trees are created out of metal with actual plant material growing inside and up the structures. In a few years many of these structures will just look like mammoth trees. Totally amazing and beautiful. Go there at night and enjoy all the lights.,,
,,Fabulous,4,,"We visited at night when the trees were all lit up, what a wonderful experience, recommended, we did not have time to go on the walk but when we return we will book for a walk between the trees",,
,,Lovely way to spend a few hours,5,,"We visited the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest late afternoon and then stayed on for the 7.45 light show in the gardens, which was fabulous. As it was just after the Chinese New Year there was a special display of dahlias.
Beautifully laid out the animals made of wood and moss were fascinating. We especially enjoyed the interesting cacti display. We arrived at the Cloud Forest just as they started misting all the plants so had to wait for that to finish before we could take photos!",,
,,Singapore Feb 2018,5,,Gardens By The Bay is a vast spread of Flora and Founa by the Bay. One can walk around the picturesque garden and spend half a day. The climax of the visit is the lighting at the supertree. It's really mesmerizing. One needs to get to the place in time and find a spot to enjoy the show to the full. We had great fun!,,
,,a very nice place to visit,5,,if you go early you'll enjoy this place much more - the climate inside is a relief when temperature are high in Singapore,,
,,Beautiful Gardens,5,,My husband & I visited here after going to the Marine sands sky park. It's just a short walk to the gardens. They are well laid out & easy on the foot. We visited the Flower Dome & the Cloud forest which are situated in the gardens. Well worth a visit. Would have done more but ran out of time.,,
,,Fabulous!,5,,Great attraction - free entry (small fee for the aerial walkway). Sits in the area close to the Marina Sands - nice walk and photo opportunity which is enhanced at night by the lighting.,,
,,Pick out a few highlights first,5,,"This place is huge, so if, like me, you've only got a limited tolerance for flowers and trees then make sure you plan your trip carefully so that you don't run out of steam.
The two indoor domes are absolutely worth doing and I would recommend that you start with them while you're still fresh. I arrived about 4:30pm on a Saturday and was pleasantly surprised that I didn't have to wait long at any stage.
The Supertree Grove was pretty incredible and make sure you see the light show. The tree top walk looked good, but I didn't do it as I'd had enough of the gardens by then. The gardens are very popular but because they are so large it doesn't really feel too crowded.",,
,,A must visit when in Singapore,5,,"Easy to get too and accessed through the Marina Bay Sands hotel, the gardens are well worth a visit. As with everything in Singapore the gardens are immaculate and well laid out, whilst very popular it didn't feel crowded. It's well signed and staff are helpful and friendly. There are a couple of restaurants and it's very wheel chair friendly. Go and enjoy.",,
,,Avatar light show,5,,Lovely gardens to walk through by day but even more impressive by night when all lit up. Looks just like avatar - free to see unless you want to see it from above,,
,,Absolutely amazing,5,,Visited the gardens by the bay both during the day and booked a night tour with trip advisor. Wow what an experience it was fantastic,,
,,"Crowded, a bit overrated",3,,"We visited in the evening. Flower Dome was very crowded and children were running around everywhere, crying, screaming and playing. We enjoyed Cloud Forest more, especially the walk down the ""mountain"". Overall, these places are kind of cool, but overrated. There should be a max number of people so that it doesn't feel like a kindergarden.",,
,,Exploring and learning at the same time!,5,,"Prepare for more than 2 hours to explore this huge garden. Not only you will see the numerous varieties of plants, trees, and flowers, also different types of garden.
The highlight is definitely the Supertree at the centre, but I also enjoyed walking through the colonial garden, Chinese garden, Malay garden, and other theme also learn about palms, trees, even other species that lives around trees.
If you're on a tight budget, you don't have to spend money here, but if you're willing to pat more, they have several great attractions and activities too. Perfect for a solo traveller, a couple, and family!",,
,,It was fun.,3,,"It was a great place to visit at night, lots of other tourists though, the tree light shows were spectacular.",,
,,A garden/park gem in Singapore,5,,"An interesting facility of, gardens, sculptures, plants, exhibits and water features. The light show at night is worth a visit and if you time it right you could be on the aerial walkway amongst the lights.",,
,,Beautiful Gardens,5,,The gardens are beautiful. They were opened 5 years ago on reclaimed land. The park has an indoor gardens for a fee. The gardens also include several restaurants. In the evening there is beautiful light show in the trees in the gardens. It is a relaxing place to admire the plants and flowers of Singapore.,,
,,Loved it!,4,,A fantastic combination of nature and engineering. Spotlessly clean - not even a rouge leaf out of place. The tree top walk through the man made trees is a must do.,,
,,Must visit!!,5,,This place is beautiful. There is a light show every day in the evening at 8pm. Make sure you visit and don't miss out! The greenhouses are also amazing!,,
,,"cool conditions inside, amazing plant life and art, good touring!",5,,"This is quite an amazing place to visit. It is a pleasant cool off from the sweaty heat outdoors. Amazing plant life mixed with art/sculptures/wood, etc. Well planned out and maps to get around. The high-walk way was closed due to lightning threat which was a disappointment, but appreciate the safety/care. A must to see!",,
,,Cloud forest is a must,4,,"Gardens by the bay has 3 main areas:

1) cloud forest - this is the larger of the two dimes which houses an impressive waterfall and lots of greenery

2) flower dome - smaller of the two domes which houses smaller plants and flowers that aren鈥檛 generally seen in Singapore (for tourists from Europe these are flowers you would see on a daily basis so aren鈥檛 that impressive).

3) supertree grove - this will be the first thing you spot as you make your way to gardens by the bay. Very impressive structures and there is a light show at 7:45pm and 8:45pm every night - it鈥檚 not brilliant but it鈥檚 nice to look at

Overall the gardens by the bay is a must, HOWEVER:

- it鈥檚 annoying how tourists have to buy tickets for both domes ($30 each for 2 domes) whereas locals can buy individual dome tickets ($10 per dome)
- you have to pay an extra $8 to go up into the super-tree walkway",,
,,An excellent day out,5,,There is so much to see and enjoy in this attraction. Prices are reasonable for what it offers. Singapore metro will get you quite close subject to a short walk. Wholly enjoyed our time there.,,
,,"Such a BEAUTIFUL place! btw, stop at BAYFRONT station if you take the SMRT.",5,,"This place is really beautiful! Must visit when in Singapore. Make sure to stay for the light shows at night! Tip: If you are taking the SMRT, stop at BAYFRONT station. This station is where the gardens and Marina Bay Hotel is situated.",,
,,An Unique Garden,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is an unique place considering that it is located in Singapore an equatorial country. Apart from a variety of climatic environments for a huge collection of plants and flowers, this place has the highest indoor waterfall in the world and also the largest glass house in the world!",,
,,Beautiful Park,5,,Even if you don鈥檛 go to the Cloud Forest or the Flower Dome it is wort the time to stroll through this lovely park. There is even a free light show at 7:45 and 8:45 every night.,,
,,Day outing,5,,"We toured the two domes and were extremely pleased with the experience. We鈥檝e been to similar sites elsewhere in the world but this is the best we鈥檝e seen.

The SPD$8 mobile audio tour around the site was a great introduction to the site.

All staff very friendly, courteous and helpful.",,
,,Fab tourist destination,5,,"Beautiful city garden full of attractions for any age group. Well signposted and lots of clean toilet facilities. The flower gardens, children鈥檚 water park are great for cooling down. Well worth a visit both in the day and at night.",,
,,A fantastic installation filled with flowers and green!,4,,If you are interested in ferns and orchids this is the place for you! It is a fantastic walk through the installation but also lifts for those who think it is to much!,,
,,Stunningly beautiful Garden,5,,"This is just a short walk able distance from the merlion in fact you can combine your visit to the merlion and the gardens , one pof the best gardens i witnessed the cloud tower and the flower dome is is stunningly beautiful. a sight to behold
You can book your tickets on line and avoid the que at the gates",,
,,Wonderful,5,,"If you can visit this place during after noon where you can see it during the day time and at night

when the sun goes down and the city brightening up with lights you can see the beauty of the garden as well as the city

you might have seen natural forests water falls but still
visiting here will not waste your money and time

If you come in the afternoon you can see both gardens and walk to the merlion to see the light show",,
,,Great Visit,5,,Wonderful gardens and the domes are well worth a visit $28 for both. The evening light show is a must to see.,,
,,Nice park but鈥?4.0,,it is very expensive as you have to pay for every attraction individually. However the cloud forrest and flower dome are very well made and worth the visit.,,,
,,Excellent day out,5,,"Great day out, plan your time well and make sure you see what interests you including the domes which have a good variety of succulents. There was a Chinese New Year and Alice in Wonderland theme inside the domes. Take packed picnic food and drinks if you want to save time and money and buy tickets in advance.",,
,,amazing views,5,,this was a 10 Singapore dollar ride from our hotel and well worth a visit. you really need to go late afternoon and stay for the evening light shows to appreciate every aspect of this amazing spectacle,,
,,Lovely garden,5,,"Visited garden during day time it was in 2 sections and both are very good. However, missed evening light show at this place, one should plan to visit in evening to ensure he can club his visit with the light show.",,
,,Amazing,5,,"Very impressive in concept ,design and execution. The cloud forest is truly amazing with a stunning array of habitats including rainforest . The waterfall entrance and viewing platform atop are stunning . The linked flower gardens have an incredible range of beautiful flora and fauna across all continents . A great day out .",,
,,Amazingly beautiful mix of vegetable and mineral!,5,,"A delightful experience to wander this garden with its ultra modern dimensions and gorgeous floral displays indoors and out.
Whilst it was obviously busy it didn鈥檛 feel so.
Staff were helpful and courteous.
Plenty of eateries available within the park.
Well worth a visit but make time for it!",,
,,By Far the best garden I have seen,5,,"Best garden I have seen, though you will need to walk pretty far but it鈥檚 worth it. Amazing place and hope to be back in the city again",,
,,Stunning Gardens by the Bay,5,,So much to see for free but the domes are amazing and so many photo oppotunities. Great attraction that we would highly recommend for everyone.,,
,,Not to be missed !!!,5,,"Fabulous day out gardens truly magnificent , after spending the day in the gardens we walked across the bridge to the marina bay hotel and up to the roof terrace where we spent the evening to watch the light show of the gardens and all Singapore and it lit up what a sight amazing then we walked back to the gardens to see the trees with there light show what a magnificent day.",,
,,A Must-See When In Singapore,5,,"This garden was incredibly beautiful. For a biologist like me, it was a wonderland. It is full of exotic and interesting species of plants from all around the world. The architecture and the intricateness of the garden is something to appreciate. We stayed for the sunset and watched a few minutes of the light show, and it was just a great experience all around.",,
,,Nature lover,4,,"This is a very nice place to visit. Its very relaxing. Even its crowded, i dont mind. Its still beatiful.",,
,,Amazing Indoor Garden Park!,5,,"Our private guide escorted us through this amazing wonderland last week on our visit to Singapore. We went at 10:00AM in the morning with the crowds and found the place to be garden wonderland.
The fully air-conditioned domed glass structure is amazing in itself. You feel being transported to a living jungle with all the varieties of foliage from around the world.
The picture opportunities are endless and colors are beautiful and vibrant.
The is one of the best sights in Singapore!",,
,,It is something different,4,,"I am still wondering why people could like the 'Flower dome'. It looks not natural. The 'Cloud forrest', the biggest one, is worth to visit. The architecture, engineering and mixed of system is amazing. The idea to build a walk way is good. I give 5 stars for 'Cloud forrest', but not for the smaller part",,
,,Such a Unique Place,5,,Such a unique place it's hard to give a bad review. Must visit on any trip to Singapore. Walk the bridges between the flowers if you can.,,
,,Beautiful,5,,"These vast gardens are a must visit! In keeping with the city in general, they are immaculately maintained.
The highlight is the super trees, towering impressively above the park. The twin domes are another element, each offering a different eco-system to favour the species of plants within.",,
,,Absolutely breathtaking!,5,,"We managed to get on the skywalk just in time for the 8PM show which was the best timing. I recommend getting to the entrance about 1 hour before the show and get in line. We waited for about half an hour to get up but it was definitely worth it.
The whole park is very informative, you can easily spend the whole day just walking around. There are plenty of dining options so don麓t worry about that. The souvenir shop also has a ton of great souvenirs: from books to jewelry and bok choy seeds.
Can麓t wait to visit the Gardens again!",,
,,Beautiful Experience,5,,"If you are a gardener you will love this place... if you like nature, you will love this place. Will take you at least 5 hours to see both gardens and grab something to eat.",,
,,Nice walk,4,,"Fun to walk around, lots of green, flower structures are cool. Do think the 2 indoor portions are a bit overpriced considering the Singapore botanical gardens are free, but I still went in and it was pretty good!! I loved the waterfall and walking down the large flower tower.",,
,,A must visit - so do it!,5,,"It is large, easy to navigate, scenic, clean, very walkable. Give yourself at least a hal-day to meander through the area, and stop by Satay By the Bay to enjoy a quasi-street food experience. Get to the Gardens early and leave early, as the crowd exiting after 8:00 PM can overwhelm the available travel options (taxi and MRT).",,
,,Wonderful experience,5,,I was blown away by the whole experience..a lot of effort must have been put into this project..It was worth the visit..I will definately come back,,
,,Best garden ever!,4,,"Awesome place, walking distance from MRT. Lots of different varieties of plants to see. Also its clean. We went there on a Saturday and it was super crowded. Must see the free light and sound show in evening.",,
,,Brilliant,5,,"My wife and I had a 3 night stop over in Singapore before we boarded a ship for a cruise. We visited Gardens by the bay in the way of the hop on hop off bus, what a brilliant place there is lots to do plenty of eateries but what we certainly noticed was how clean it was. I would suggest an early visit as it鈥檚 gets very busy especially in the afternoon as people wait for the light show, we didn鈥檛 stay but did watch it from the ship as we departed Singapore. Would certainly recommend gardens in the bay for all the family.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,I had a great day at the Garden by the Bay.! Amazing place.! Place to visit in Singapore .! Beautiful.!,,
,,Not to be missed,5,,"This is an attraction not be missed. Best time to go in the afternoon when the sun is hot it is pretty cool inside. Lot to lean, lots of photo opportunities",,
,,Fantastic - a must see for all visitors,5,,"Very little to say other than the Cloud and Flowers Domes are just amazing. We have never seen anything like them, absolutely a must do for any visitor to Singapore.",,
,,Beautiful,4,,A must see when in Singapore. Go to see the light show after 7pm. The lights and views are incredible!,,
,,Amazing architecture,4,,"The outdoor gardens are free and well worth seeing. The flower dome and and cloud forest are quite expensive but cooled so a nice respite from the heat. If I were going again I鈥檇 only pay for the cloud forest as that is quite spectacular and you can get a re-entry stamp. The flower dome was not great, lots of out of season plants cheek by jowl and quite a lot of wilted and dying stuff. The skyway is worth the admission but do it early before it gets too hot",,
,,Amazing displays,4,,"Both the flower dome and the forest pavilion are worth going to. The wait, even on a holiday, only involved ticket buying and that wasn鈥檛 long at all. If you are a plant aficionado or just like plants, please go to both. The flower dome shows a fantastic display of exotic varieties of tropical plants and flowers. The atmosphere is also nice and cool. The Forrest display is nice because of the cloud and mist feel that the waterfall gives. Fantastic dragon wood carvings along the walk ways. Interesting fauna as well.",,
,,Eco-friendly and Amazing,5,,Everyone should come here and learn how we can be more responsible with our environment. In addition you have extraordinary planetariums around you!,,
,,Nice show,5,,"Excellent place, i was impressed by the Macrodomes and the structure of the Trees. The light show in the evening was amazing.",,
,,A must for any traveller,5,,"A fascinating and most unusual place to visit, it can get very crowded and busy and you may have to wait to enter some of the attractions. Some attractions are free others a small charge.

You could easily spend a full day here, the highlight being the evening light show at the Super trees.

Transport to and from the Gardens is fairly good but expect to wait for a taxi after the light shows at the end of the evening.

All in all a wonderful place to visit.",,
,,Amazing,5,,"This is a must see if you are visiting Singapore. The outside gardens are free but make sure you pay the extra to visit the Cloudforest and the Flower Dome. I suggest an early visit to avoid the large crowds. We arrived at around 9.30am and visited the Cloudforest first and it was very pleasant walking around, however by the time we exited it the crowds had grown substantially and our visit to to Flower Dome was very crowded. Also if you can present a Singapore Airlines boarding pass you are entitled to a 10 percent discount on the entrance fees. Would have liked to also have visit at night time as I would imagine the lights would be quite spectacular.",,
,,Wonderful Indoor Park,4,,"It was really nice to visit this place in the afternoon when the sky goes dark. The different lighting give a good impression about the place and make us feel differently.

The price fits with the one you got. A lot of wonderful flowers. Good place to go around.

I highlight the dome part as a must have place to visit.",,
,,A gorgeous wonderland!,5,,My first visit to Gardens by the Bay was a pleasant surprise. It was so gorgeous and we felt totally in awe visiting the 2 domes and surrounding areas. Even my young daughters appreciated the beauty.,,
,,Fabulous experience,5,,If you only do one thing in Singapore go to the gardens by the bay light show. Get there about an hour before the performance find your spot and lie back and watch the trees come to life. Most memorable experience!,,
,,"Just great, don't miss",5,,"When you have seen the Gardens by the Bay, you have seen more than you would have expected in the also wonderful Botanical Gardens. Excellent exhibits!",,
,,CNY visit,5,,"Nice display of different flowers, especially the Daili and chrysanthemum. The Lego display at the Lost World is also a good attraction.",,
,,Very nice interesting place - but not really a place with children,5,,"The tallest building has the worlds largest inside waterfall. You take the elevator to the top and walk inside and outside the ""jungle"" on the way down. Very nice. The flower house was less impressive. Areas from all over the world. We did not spent the night there - so we did not see the light show",,
,,Stunning,5,,"Whoever dreamed these gardens up must have been bordering on genius. A great place to visit. The sights, fragrances and relaxed atmosphere were a tonic.",,
,,Perfect for half day tour!,5,,One of the nicest and most relaxing place ever.. minutes away from the Marina! Highly recommended! Good value and beautiful plants and flowers... a must-do while in singapore.,,
,,Breath-taking,5,,"A wonderful experience viewing plants, flowers and trees. So amazingly designed with fantastic colours and smells. A must see. There is also a night musical show which is worth viewing.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,Really beautiful to spend the day here! Go early during the week and you will enjoy it much more without the crowds!,,
,,Love This Place,5,,My wife and I loved Gardens by the Bay. Take a leisurely walk but don鈥檛 forget to bring an umbrella for Shade as it gets very hot in Singapore and the sun can bake you. The light and music show is a must.,,
,,Night out,4,,This is a place not to be missed We loved it just perfect for nice drink with fantastic views nice to go at night. Then you can see everything that goes on,,
,,Nice place to hangout,5,,Nice place to hangout! And it's free. But if you want to go to park inside gardens by the bay. You have to pay for it. And I'm riding the vehicle to go inside the gardens. Overall it was nice experience,,
,,Breathtaking!,5,,"Well worth the entry fee and be prepared to spend most of the day in this fascinating place. We were there from 2pm until 8pm and still missed bits. Plenty of facilities including transport, restaurants and cafes etc. Well worth staying for the light and sound show which happens twice at about 7.30 and 8.15. If you have a particular interest in botany then stay longer.",,
,,Phase one,5,,We went as there was a deal on visit one and the other is free. Splendid afternoon visiting both.Great walk about taking your time to enjoy the different plants and wild they are too.Enjoy take the camera and chill,,
,,Spectacular,5,,A must see at night. Absolutely magical. The lights synchronized with the music give it a fairy-like vibe.,,
,,evening in the gardens,4,,Very good and amazing to see but unfortunately also very crowded - so be prepared for loads of people which makes getting around and seeing things more difficult.,,
,,Too much people although visit in the night time,3,,I planned to visit Garden by the Bay in the night time due to temperature and crowd but it's not different. Too much people and I could see or notice anything much.,,
,,A night visit,4,,we went to the gardens by the bay late afternoon and walked around the gardens before it became dark. awesome to visit and after a quick bite to eat at one of the restaurants we watched the light show which you must see.,,
,,mesmerising,5,,"We happened to stumble upon the evening light show and wow was it fantastic. Not to be missed. Breath taking and a marvel to see,",,
,,Spectacular light show,5,,"We went to the Gardens by the Bay as part of a City Tours package so we only spent an hour and a half at the event which allowed a quick dinner followed by 15 minutes of the most spectacular light show we have ever seen! If you want to see more of the Gardens in daylight and get value for money, I suggest that you go in the afternoon and stay for the light show which started at 7.45pm.
It may be advisable to take a light raincoat, umbrella or poncho at certain times of the year to ensure full enjoyment of the gardens.
A variety of food at reasonable prices available.",,
,,beautiful,4,,"It was too busy so we were not able to purchase tickets for the cloud Dome. Only for the Flower Dome. Flowerdome is a bit boring, it was really busy but nice to check it out. Although I expected more from the Dome. After we finished The Flower Dome there was no queue for the Cloud Dome so I went back to the ticket booth to buy tickets. Usually If you buy a combined ticket you'll get discount but unfortunately this time they did not want to do this. The Cloud Dome is definitely worth visiting it exceeded my expectations. Specially when you go around eight o'clock In the evening there is mist sprayed in the dome and it makes for beautiful pictures.",,
,,Cloudforest is amazing,4,,I totaly loved the Cloudforest. All the effort they put into it. And the view on top is very nice. The Flower Dome was also quite nice but not really my cup of tea. But check out the wooden Sculptures inside the Dome. They're awsome!,,
,,Must See in Singapore,5,,"What you need to know is that you don't need to buy a pass to see the nightly shows. There are two each night where the trees light up and play to music. This is free. You only need tickets to see the Flower Conservatory and the other pavilion with the waterfall. If you just go to the Gardens by the Bay and walk around it is all free. There are many restaurants in the Gardens by the Bay, including a McDonald's.",,
,,Outstanding beauty in Downtown Singapore,5,,"The Gardens by the Bay is a beautiful area bordering the river. Millions of dollars have been spent turning this area into a magnificent spectacle of nature. First of all it won鈥檛 cost a cent to get in and the route you take is spectacular in its own way. You take an elevator and walk over the busy highway and tranquil river to enter the gardens. Once there you can wander around the grounds, and there is much to see, even if you don鈥檛 want to spend any money on the exhibits. A wonderful open space in a busy city.",,
,,Not to be missed,5,,"Definitely worth a visit, my favourite is the one with th waterfall and it is truly so well done, not to be missed",,
,,Great tourist location,5,,Great place to go for tourists. Love how things are designed there. Sending out great ECO friendly messages.,,
,,Absolutely Beautiful,5,,We went to both flower domes plus the amazing outdoor gardens. It is really breath taking at the beautiful We stayed for the light show which was amazing. It is definitely worth going to see.,,
,,Its a must,5,,Its a must to visit at least once when in Singapore. Especially when they have a theme going on like the CNY celebration recently,,
,,Beautiful Flowers,5,,An outing with friend. We had enjoyed the Chinese New Year Flowers and Decorations inside Flower Dome! Looking forward to more theme flowers and decorations!,,
,,nice garden,5,,we love it here. very beautiful garden and very easy to go to visit by mrt.I visited during chinese on 17th Feb. so it was very very crowed by tourists and locals!!!,,
,,"Make two visits, one by day, one at night.",5,,"A key image of modern Singapore, well illustrated in guidebooks, for me this is a ""must see"". The gardens are huge, well laid out and just right for strolling by day admiring the plants, the Chinese and Indian Gardens and the Futuristic ""Giant Trees"".

At night paths are well lit and give the feeling that you have walked onto the film set of some Sci-Fi film set in 25th Century. Importantly though even late at night one feels completely safe.

We chose simply to stroll so the gardens rate as one of the best ""free"" attractions we have visited.",,
,,Amazing,5,,Well worth visiting. Amazing architectural work - the whole park area is something to see and walk through,,
,,Expensive but worth it,5,,"With the strong Singapore dollar, this is an expensive visit but worth every dollar as you will be treated to the sight of beautiful flowers from around the world arranged in eye - pleasing manner. Worth visiting but because of the price not for repeated visits.",,
,,Really worth a visit,5,,"This place is very highly recommended. Make sure you have plenty of time, as there鈥檚 a lot to see. The staff are very helpful.",,
,,Fascinating Garden,5,,If you love plants then a tour of Gardens by the Bay is highly recommended. The display of so many exotic plans from different countries is captivating and a visit is highly recommended.,,
,,Should be on your visit list when in Singapore,5,,Best example of how modern infrastructure can be put together with nature. You will find how nature is clubbed with modern infrastructure to give you a wonderful experience. Don't miss the show in the evening,,
,,Birthday Visit,5,,"I had the opportunity to book a shuttle to the Gardens By The Bay on the morning of my birthday this year. I was only visiting Singapore for a long weekend so for me this was something I really wanted to see and it was a perfect day weather wise to visit.

My entry included the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest, not only are the flowers and trees beautiful and immaculate, but there were gorgeous sculptures throughout the space and decorations for Chinese New Year. There is also a giant waterfall feature that took me by surprise at its grandeur. I liked the fact that they have it set up as though you are going on a journey as you walk through the different areas learning about the different species of plants and flowers in this one area. Unlike any gardens I have seen before, incredibly unique to Singapore.

Lastly I went out to view the man made trees, giants towering over you, how did they create these?! Quite mesmerizing you could stand out there for hours! I did not see the gardens by night but I would go there again in a heartbeat!",,
,,Simply amazing,5,,"Visited cloud forest and flower dome. Just amazing to see how its been made. Better to go in the evening, as it looks more beautiful with the lighting. Last entry for flower dome is by 8.25 pm local time.",,
,,Amazing place,5,,"Went late afternoon & paid & queued for the Sky Walk, by the time we went into the tower it was getting dark. We could'nt have chosen a better time & experienced the entire light & music show from the Sky Walk, a great view",,
,,Amazing place !,5,,"This place is absolutely amazing ! I was there 2 years ago with my friends and again I went there last month and this place still in my list for a must thing to see in Singapore. The garden is very beautiful, many different types of flowers, what make this place awesome is the architecture. You can walk from one place to another, some places you have to pay but some places you can just look around. You can spend around 2 hours to get to see all the details of this amazing place. Highly recommended & I'll be back",,
,,Amazing!,5,,This is just breathtaking attraction. The way of thinking is simply different. You have to see it :-).,,
,,STUNNING BEAUTIFUL PLACE,5,,"Singapore is small in size but there is quite a bit to see and do and this is 1 place you MUST visit.

Beautiful pace that you can walk round and take your surroundings in. Great for spending the day relaxing and looking around and all the plats, trees and areas are beautiful and kept immaculate

IF IN SINGAPORE DEFINATELY WORTH A VISIT",,
,,Beautiful but hot in the afternoon,5,,Beautiful gardens to stroll and sit and contemplate. Due to time constraints we were here in the afternoon which is really hot. Next time we will make sure to visit in the morning!,,
,,Beautiful gardens,5,,"It was very crowded because of the Chinese New Year weekend, but it was still very interesting to see so many different flowers, baobabs and great decorations. I took both Flower Dome and Clowd Forest (28 dollars) and they were amazing. Took about 2 and half hours and could stay longer if it weren't so busy.",,
,,Dont MIss THis GARDEN,5,,"Myself with my friend had an evening walk ,saw beautiful Flora well maintained and decorated . extremely relaxing.I recommend this Garden visit.",,
,,Amazing experience,5,,"The best value for money experience you could ask for. It was an amazing place to visit, we could have spent hours and hours there. Very beautiful with so much to see and experience. Would definitely recommend and go back again.",,
,,Beautiful & mesmerizing experience,5,,"Amazing Experience. There is lot to do for every age group.

It should not be missed. For the flower lovers ,Orchid garden is heaven !!

The best time would be around dusk, so you will be able to view day sites as well as the light show that takes place after sunset. Amazing show. should not be missed.

The best was Sky bridge over super groove trees.

There is also bicycle track for cycling around the rive bank area.

Must vsit.",,
,,Better Get your feet & stamina ready,4,,"it is as beautiful as it is. but you must bring water and a lot of patience. When you are playful, you will appreciate the place even more. Bring Umbrella and extra clothes there is a small water park near the flower dome (not sure). Best time to go there is morning.",,
,,Chuay 2018,5,,"Nice garden with many type of flowers and cooling , easy parking lot and easy accessible to every corner of garden",,
,,My favorite place in Singapore!,5,,"Probably my favorite place in the whole Singapore, a place you can wander around and relax under trees and great planets. Sometimes it may be a little bit too hot so maybe you can go the Botanic Gardens which they have really comfortable temperature control.
If you have time you can walk from gardens by the bay to the Merlion Park to Clark Bay, it may take some time but you can definitely see the beautiful city view of Singapore.",,
,,Just fabulous,5,,"I鈥檓 gonna go all out say the the cloud forest wins here hands down!!! It is just stunning and an incredible piece of engineering! The quality of the experience was wonderful! Beware if your not so hot on heights it can be a little demanding but nothing too dramatic! Really one of the best things I done in Singapore. The gardens by the bay are also pretty cool, very unique and lovely way to escape the crowds of the domes! Again there is a high walk, but must be done! The view is just fantastic! Hint-try to head at night to see the light display! There is a bridge that leads straight from the gardens to the marina bay hotel if you want to incorporate that! Only negative I would say is it gets very very very busy!!!! But why wouldn鈥檛 it! Hope it helps!",,
,,Different Huge Greenery Surreal Beautiful,4,,"It is one of the very recent attractions added to the Singapore city. Its very huge area full lush green. people who has interest in flowers, nature, greenery is a must go. Beautiful falls, different types of domes to visit inside it. Cloud forest is beautiful with variety of flowers, gardens, high rise sky walk. Its a different feel altogether. It has a very high rise waterfall also inside it.
There are a couple of eating outlets such as Mc. Donadls etc also inside for a quick bite. It internally connects to marina bay via a bridge at its exit.
Overall a nice place, it needs minimum half a day to cover the place.",,
,,Short trip the Bay,4,,"Kids will learn of the Varieties of the plants , flower and trees grow in different countries and also experience the different climates.",,
,,Visit during Chinese New Year 2018,3,,Nothing much to see as they advertise flower in import fm China also air con no so cold a bit disappointed,,
,,Great,5,,Excellent experience visiting this place. I visited twice and I wouldn't mind returning again. There are so many lovely shops and eating places,,
,,CNY at GBTB,4,,My first time there and Chinese New Year was the perfect time to visit. Beautiful flowers to take photos with!,,
,,Such a great 鈥渇ree鈥?adventure,5,,You can walk around and look at beautiful scenery. You only pay if you want to enter any of the special exhibits. You especially want to be there for the 7:45 pm super tree grove light and music show.,,
,,Must see,5,,Gardens are really nice to walk around and the super trees are a must do. Walking on them and the view of the surrounding city seems surreal. Especially nice around sunset.,,
,,Excellent,5,,Great experiences. Can look at many other plants/ flowers that I would never see in Australia. Very romantic environment at night too with all the lights,,
,,Visit during Chinese New Year,5,,Visited during perhaps their busiest time of the year. A bit rushed but thoroughly enjoyable. Would recommend picking a less crowded time,,
,,The Flowers are mostly half dead,3,,"This is the second time I visit this place. The flowers are not 'energetic' as last time when I 1st visit 2 years ago. Lots of visitors are not aware that they are not supposed to touch the flowers, especially Chinese visitors. It is heart breaking to see these flowers being 'tortured to death' :(",,
,,Gorgeous gardens with a bit of stomach churn if you鈥檙e scared of heights,5,,Gardens by the Bay is an amazing place to visit. A must in Singapore. I鈥檓 really impressed with Singapore鈥檚 effort to stay in touch with nature considering it鈥檚 such a small densely populated country... It鈥檚 a big green park with different themes gardens. Visitors only need to pay if entering the two conservatories and the skywalk up among the 鈥榮upertree鈥? The skywalk gave my stomach a churn but it is very impressive.,,
,,This Should Not Be Missed,5,,Go at Dusk and also enjoy the amazing light show. The orchid house should not be missed but allow plenty of time to see the whole area.,,
,,Day at the Bay,5,,"Something for everyone here and well worth a visit. Free to wander around the gardens and reasonably priced entrance fees for some of the attractions. Great photo opportunities, wonderful trees, plants, fountains and wildlife. Stop off at Satay by the Bay for a bite to eat too!",,
,,One huge garden,4,,A must see in Singapore. The Gardens by the Bay is a park that you could walk through for hours. Great to see at daytime as well as night time. The 2 domes are a must see while in the park as well. Its a zoo for plants and flowers from around the globe.,,
,,An obvious must do if you're in Singapore,5,,Singapore is very easy to get around and if you're a tourist you'll likely already be in this area. The Gardens are split into two sections. The price is reasonable so you should probably do both. The cloud side was very cool. You can actually climb up pretty high on it and see a nice view of Marina Bay Sands. We went during the day which was great. I imagine at night it would be even better.,,
,,Very different and surreal,4,,The gardens are very surreal lots of places to sit and relax looking at the trees and lit of an evening. Or the sky walk between the trees for 8 dollars. It's very popular and good place for a picture.,,
,,Beautiful.,5,,"Very beautiful place to visit.
It鈥檚 better to go there after 6:30 as it is when they turn on the lights.
Light show will follow shortly after.

Very nice place to hand out.
Has food court.
Very spacious.
You may get lost in the garden. Very big garden.

Entrance is free but other activities such as sky bridge and cloud forest is paid.",,
,,Good Visit,4,,Been to this great place many times. It was extremely crowded during the Cny weekend. It was packed like sardines.,,
,,Never the same no matter how often we visit,5,,New flower display and old favourites - fresh and exiting as always. Looking forward to another trip.,,
,,Uniquely Singapore,5,,"Many don鈥檛 know that Singapore is also called a city in a garden. If you don鈥檛 know it, it鈥檚 impossible not to feel it when you visit its gardens; and certainly when you are Gardens by the Bay. This gardens holds an unimaginable variety of plants from all over the world and many are meticulously cared for in two of its climate controlled domes. From seasonal plants and flowers to century old trees, this is a botanist鈥檚 dream come true. When you visit, aside from the two climate controlled domes, I highly recommend spending another couple of hours exploring all that his garden has to offer. You won鈥檛 regret it. Strolling through the garden at night gives you another version of this splendor to enjoy.",,
,,Awesomeness,5,,"The Gardens by the Bay are absolutely stunning ! Our visit is now ranked as one of the best things I have EVER experienced. even if you don鈥檛 want to pay the fee - which is very reasonable to the domes or the tree walk you can just wander and see things that will blow you away .
The whole gardens are so well set up and beautiful.
Both domes are stunning and an instagrammers dream - trust me !

Would DEFINITELY recommend !!",,
,,Very well managed,5,,Flower dome is very attractive. It can be a 1-2 hour visit. Plannning to come back and visit cloud forest next week.,,
,,A must do,5,,"A must do for anyone in Singapore. Beautiful place, totally worth it to pay for the two conservatories, the flower dome and the cloud forest. Variety of species was widely available shown in the conservatories and beautifully curated.",,
,,Great for kids,5,,Excellent garden with free activity and quite spacious ! Our daughter love the playground! Bring your swimwear for water play!,,
,,Fantastic 'Trees',5,,"Really enjoyed our time there, about 2 hours. Didn't realise the gardens themselves are free to wander round, it's the 2 domes that you pay for but that's really the whole point in going.

Wanted to see the evening light show but they had a maintenance problem so it was cancelled but it was nice to know that if I ever go back there I could just see that.
We also had a meal there from McDonald's for the first time for years, love their chicken wrap.",,
,,Must See,4,,"During daytime, you can see the real beauty of the garden in its different perspective.At night time, the musical together with its light show is captivating, if you can enjoy its lights how from afar, then there's more when you are in the garden, lying and enjoying the show",,
,,Very nice and original,5,,We spent a few hours there wow such a great outdoor attraction and what about the light show at night time. This is a must to do.,,
,,Lovely Indoor Gardens,4,,"I enjoyed both the time spent in the flower and the botanical domes. The best part was being shielded from the heat outside. Actually, there's also a surrounding outdoor park. One can go up the circular hanging bridge at the metal trees area for a walk.
There are eateries there so no issue with food and drinks.",,
,,Skywalk is fab,4,,"The free gardens are very pretty, with fountains and sculptures which are nice to enjoy. Definitely do the Skywalk amongst the ""trees"", it's fab and offers a great vantage point of the city skyline and Marina Bay Sands hotel. We didn't enjoy the Cloud and Flower domes - if you have been to the Eden Project in the UK, you could well be disappointed. It's also very very cold in there, so take a jacket. The cafes and facilities in the gardens were good.",,
,,Impressive,5,,"One of must visit in Singapore. The gardens are beautiful. The Supertrees are wonderful. First we enjoyed the outdoor gardens, and then went into the two domes. The flower dome and cloud forest were amazing, plenty of photo opportunities. The light show in the evening was spectacular.",,
,,Totally lived up to the hype!,5,,"We visited Gardens by the Bay over the Chinese New Year holiday on a Saturday with our two boys aged 3 and 6. It totally exceeded expectations. It is a modern architectural wonder and was a fantastic family day out. The Outdoor Garden Audio Tour is worth doing early on to get oriented. The Children鈥檚 Garden was a perfect stop to cool the boys down on a hot day with the water play area, recommend packing swimmers and towels. The domes are amazing and a good option for some respite from the heat. Pre-booking tickets to both domes saved us having to queue, and you can get good deals on Klook.com. Definitely worth staying on for the light show at 7:45pm, our boys were mesmerised. Recommend taking in your own food as the queues for all the cafe and restaurant outlets were long all day. Worth booking transport if you exit after one of the light shows, with the large crowds the taxi rank was chaos and it took us about 50 mins to get a cab home.",,
,,Beautiful at night,4,,"Visited both during the day and at night. Visited the Flower and Cloud Dome of which the Flower Dome is the better.
The Cloud Dome has bigger queues and bigger crowds but the Flower Dome has more to see in it.
The Trees at night are just beautiful to see but if you need to catch a taxi after the visit be wary that at night the queue can be huge!",,
,,AMAZING,5,,absolutely amazing. the world must take note of the leaps that Singapore is making - truely amazing!,,
,,One of the most enthralling places we鈥檝e been!,5,,"Can鈥檛 recommend this engineering and natural marvel more highly. We loved it, kids loved it; allow more time than you think because the dimes and park are so great.
The Satay by the Bay is a whole hawker centre rather than a restaurant - really perfect because you can customise exactly what you want; great for families.",,
,,Worth it to see the light show,5,,"Definitely see the light show here. It鈥檚 a beautiful way to see the park, spend some time around this area seeing all the attractions! Most everything is free :)",,
,,Free Water Play Area,5,,"My wife is awesome at finding free things to do with the kids: even in Singapore.
We took the kids to the Children鈥檚 Garden at the Gardens by the Bay and they had a great time playing in the sprinkler/fountain play area. There is also a play ground and some climbing sets. Great for the kids.
At the water area there is a covered theater seating area for the parents to see their kids play.",,
,,fabulous,5,,"Go visit whilst in Singapore it's a must see, otherwise you have not been to Singapore ! Great during the day or even better at night when lit up. You can walk the skywalk from tree to tree.",,
,,Must Visit,5,,One of must visit in Singapore. The outer section is free but inner section is charged. This is located opposite to merlion park.,,
,,Excellent day out.,5,,"We spent a number of hours in the gardens from mid afternoon until the light show at night. It was very warm but found the gardens to be relaxing. The various areas were well laid out, all shrubs and plants were well tended, which provided many photographic opportunities. The light show in the evening was spectacular and although very busy we thoroughly enjoyed our visit , if visiting Singapore we would suggest this is a must do!",,
,,Stunning,5,,"The gardens are beautiful and yet they are constructing another huge section.
Free entry to main gardens
Tickets sold separately for skydome walk, flower dome and cloud harvest.

Wheelchair assessable throughout park very good

Monthly music and light special themes conducted at night during 1 or 2 sessions, check your dates.
These are well worth viewing, free, and due to being free thousands attend.
Warning - at end of show attendees leave using one bridge over the water that separates the treetop domes. It is chaotic. Either hang about for 10 minutes or have patience.

Take MRT to Bayfront station, exit B and walk a short distance under the linkway. Easy.",,
,,Best attraction !!!,5,,I loved this so much! Was well worth the money! Book online to save time skipping queues! The cloud dome and the flower greenhouse are amazing. We didn鈥檛 pay to go up to the sky walk on the super groves which was fine! We had so much fun anyway!! Leave lots of time!,,
,,Wonderful,5,,Just a great place to wander around and look with amazement at what all is around you. Take the elevator up one of the 鈥渢rees鈥?to the elevated walkway for great views.,,
,,Purpose built attraction,5,,"I imagine when someone thought this place up the government just said ""we need a world class attraction on this new bit of reclaimed land to go with our stupid new massive three tower boatel and money is no object"".

It certainly seems like someone had about $100 billion or something to blow on a single project.

And not in a bad way- it is an amazing garden with lots of shade for the heat, the domes are great too (if expensive) and the skywalk is reportedly excellent ( though usually has a long queue)

Fantastic kids facilities including a massive splash park, sand playground and adventure play - tons of meal options from top class to hot dogs and microwave noodles (also very nice).

A fantastic attraction which is mostly free and even worth going to Singapore specifically to see.",,
,,Stunning,5,,"Just stunning Not enough time to explore but a must do Huge globes housing gardens/waterfalls Huge parkland Lot treetop walk You name it, it has it",,
,,Must See....,5,,The Gardens by the Bay domes are amazing! The largest indoor waterfall and the ecological levels Singapore are going to is a must see whist you are visiting Singapore!!!,,
,,Amazing,5,,"This park is absolutely amazing and the outdoor part is free to stroll around , plenty to see. You do pay to go into the glass houses and it is well worth the money and is actually pleasantly cool inside ! You can take as long as you like and there is so much to see.
You also have to pay to walk along the suspended walkway from which there are great views.
Lovely place to visit.",,
,,Great Day !,4,,Put this on your list when you visit Singapore! A lot of things to see and do here ! Fun for all ages,,
,,"Impressive, worth price",5,,"very impressive, plan on at least a half day. worth revisiting at night for a different experience. both greenhouses are impressive and unique",,
,,Worthy Top Attraction,5,,"An iconic place which shows how much can be achieved, and how successfully. This place is beautiful, immaculate as you'd expect from Singapore, and has to be visited. The Supertrees are wonderful, but then so is the parkland and all the individual garden areas around them. The Skyway is high and can be windy but offers great views and is worth doing.
The Cloud dome is spectacular, even if you don't do the top walkways. The Flower dome has plants from all around the world, even daffodils and roses alongside cacti and proteas!
There are many food offering around from MacDonalds to Asian cafes to top end dining but it's worth the slightly longer walk to Satay on the Bay for some great Hawker style street food in a very relaxed setting.",,
,,Terrific evening light show amid lovely surrounds,4,,"Arrived mid to late afternoon and had a leisurely walk around most of the gardens before the light show commenced about 7.00pm, What a great show and the accompanying music was well selected, only drawback was in leaving the area as the crowds were very large and all seemed to want to go the same way as us, only a minor inconvenience and Singapore should be very proud of her Gardens by the Bay",,
,,beautiful,4,,just take the time to take a stroll in the gardens. It will not disappoint. Behind MBS and easy to get to by mRT,,
,,Awesome!,5,,"Awesome! The most incredible place to visit in the middle of a Singapore's busy-life. It well worth the cost of entry, really. Flower dome was so magical with all beautiful flowers from around the world. I'm glad I could see the Christmas village exhibit, amazingly wonderful.",,
,,A Must Visit,5,,"As a tourist, you have to go & experience GBTB. Unique, different and a great chill way to spend the day.",,
,,Lovely in the evening!,5,,"Really enjoyed the walk in the evening. The place is so calm and fantastic views of the basin with light reflections, good view of the Singapore flyer, marina bay sands hotel and lighted towers. See the pictures. Surely a must visit for tourists.

Good place to grab a bite too!",,
,,Highly recommend!,5,,"First we enjoyed the beautiful outdoor gardens, and then went into the two domes. They were well worth it! The cloud dome has a huge waterfall, and beautiful flowers everywhere. The flower dome had beautiful flowers, but also a huge cactus collection.",,
,,Must see if you are in singapore,5,,Has a lot to offer ... try and go there late afternoonish to wander ground the gardens and catch the tree grove lighting show. Marina bay sands is 15 mins walk away from there so ahead down there afterwards for the laser and light show. It was super packed when I was there for chinese new year. Return journey in the hotel was a bit of a nightmare but that is expected of any big city events.,,
,,Best Attraction in Singapore,5,,"I thoroughly enjoyed walking around this garden all day. The flower dome and cloud forest were amazing- make sure you get to the cloud forest at misting time as it truely amazing. The rest of the park is immaculate, plenty of photo opportunities and it's worth exploring every inch- planet, the dragonfly ponds, etc. I would recommend the Supertree Rooftop but if that is a little pricing then the Skywalk is a very good cheaper option (SGD 8 p/p), but I wouldnt recommend both. The Garden Rhapsody light show is well worth it and runs daily at 7:45pm and 8:45pm with a duration of 15mins.

If you flew with Singapore Airlines, you can show your boarding pass for a 10% discount on the flower dome and cloud forest.

If you are feeling hungry I would recommend checking out Satay by the Bay for some great local food options.

Overall a must see if you are visiting Singapore.",,
,,Gardens by the bay,5,,Amazing . Bit confusing at the beginning but once you have your tickets it's fabulous. Very hot and no shade at the skywalk so perhaps go early,,
,,Beautiful spot,5,,"Well worth a visit and cheap, these gardens are definitely a highlight of my trip. I would recommend finding your way to the bottom of the tallest man made tree and paying the small fee to have a drink (alcoholic or nonalcoholic) at the top, there are wonderful views of the whole park including views out to sea and all local attractions in close proximity.",,
,,Great lace to visit,5,,"Worth visiting, flower dome was beautiful and pay to go on the audio tour . If not going on a tour the taxi rank is very slow with waiting up to 45 minutes for a taxi to come. Either pre- arrange a pickup or ring a book a cab for pickup.",,
,,Pleasant outdoor area,4,,"Since you will probably be in this area to see other attractions, I can recommend spending a bit more time to walk around the gardens to see some interesting plants and statues. Free.",,
,,Beautiful!,5,,"Wow loved this place! Was such a wonderful way to spend an afternoon and we thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful scenery and the 2 domes which housed so many colourful and perfect flowers and trees. I would recommend this place to the young and old, families and couples or even just a nice quiet stroll alone.",,
,,Not to be missed !,5,,If you only do one attraction in Singapore this is the one. It really is fantastic both daytime and night time. So close to the city yet you could be on a different planet. Unless you choose to do the skywalk or visit the flower domes it is totally free. Beautiful.,,
,,Easy with kids & interesting,5,,"These gardens are fun for kids to look around, there are waterfalls, pathways & sculptures that the kids enjoyed. A cool escape inside the domes!!",,
,,Fascinating,5,,"This is a real marvel. When you're dropped off, you walk up the slope to the ticket booth. You can just wander for free or go on the skywalk between the trees for a small fee. We didn't go into the conservatories but I bet they're spectacular.

It's hard not to be impressed and delighted..",,
,,Amazing place,4,,"The architecture of the domes is incredible, the variety of fauna is amazing. The walk (or jogging) in the gardens is very pleasant too, with astonishing Supertree Grove and walkway and fabulous view on Marina Bay Sands hotel. Wort the visit at night too",,
,,WOW nice place good to come at sunset and when all the lights begin,5,,"Wonderful place if you stay at marina bay you have rooms width this views it鈥檚 ne鈥檈r the butaniq garden , all happy hour the lights are dancing",,
,,GREAT WAY TO PASS A FEW HOURS,4,,"Costs to enter the two conservatories but its well worth the price of 28 dollars (add 8 dollars to do the walkway). Each conservatory contains an array of fascinating natural wonders. I particularly enjoyed the cloud forest and walkway sections. Wonderful layout and a great way to pass a few hours. Note at 7.45 and 8.45 each evening there is a 15 minute light show, very impressive.",,
,,Fun Day Out,4,,"Spent a great day eating Hawker food at Satay by the Bay, visiting the Cloud Forest and Supergrove treetop walkway. Bit frustrating to have to buy separate tickets for those things...not sure why you can't just purchase one that allows access to all three main attractions. The light show at the Supergrove trees to end the day was fantastic!",,
,,Beautiful park,5,,The plants and trees are a sight to see. Well manicured areas. The evening light show is decent. Total experience is worth the effort. Very crowded at public holidays.,,
,,I visited twice,5,,This garden never miss it during visit singapore .It's the main attraction .the garden very beautiful especially after 7 pm .when the sun start th get down .there is 2light and sound show daily for free .just if you want to get up to the bridge it cost 8 Singaporean dollar.,,
,,Beautiful,5,,"Stopped for 2 days in Singapore on the way home, so pleased we visited Gardens by the Bay. Spectacular in the day and evening, loved the Cloud Forest Dome.",,
,,must see,5,,"amazing place, amazing plants, trees, atmosphere. it was ""wow"" and if you visit Singapore, don't miss chance to see it",,
,,A green oasis in the metropolis,5,,"Gardens By The Bay is must visit when you are in Singapore. It's a huge nature park that has been fantastically engineered in the coolest and trendiest way possible to suit modern times. Apart from getting the chance to witnessing the unique green architectural infrastructures, one is also awarded with a fantastic view of the Singapore nightline from various vantage points within the facility. It is highly recommended to stroll through the garden in the evening especially around the Supertree area when the beautiful lighting comes into effect.

PS: For those worried about paying the entrance fees, most of the areas can be accessed free of cost. :)",,
,,Must See!,5,,"You cant go to Singapore and not visit this place.
It's free entry at all times with a few add ons when visiting the flower dome, skywalk or indoor waterfall.
The gardens are breathtaking during the day but the light show at night is just something else! Be sure to get there early and grab a spot under the trees to see the show!",,
,,Very Nice Place,4,,Gardens by the Bay should be definitely seen on Singapore visit. Very nicely done. It was a unique experience on this visit.,,
,,One of the Best Place to Visit,5,,Its just awesome and the care taken by the staff is incredible. Must visit. Visit both the domes.!!!,,
,,Fantastic Place,5,,"Spectacular place to be and walk around. They have some payable sights to see but if one doesn't want to spend his money, the free parts of the gardens are extremely beautiful to spend ur time. They have little buses for the ones that prefer to walk less. The only issue is that the place is almost always overcrowded, so try and find what hours are the most quiet. A must see attraction.",,
,,Refreshing Experience,5,,"The light show is amazing. When I was there, the theme of the light show was, I think, celebrating diversity in, in which they played popular national song from several countries in Asia.

The Cloud Forest is also an amazing experience, it's really high, cool and beautiful inside. However, the Flower Dome is somewhat plain, I mean, if you're not really in to flower, you would find it a bit boring",,
,,Magic,5,,"We went to see the light show on a Friday night, discovering afterwards that Friday is the busiest night of the week. There were literally hundreds of people there. The show begins at 7.45 pm and is absolutely spell binding. Lasts for about 15 minutes. There was a queue for taxis at the taxi rank one it had finished, but we got there in the end and were lucky enough to get a driver with excellent English who told us where to go for 24 hour shopping.",,
,,Unlike anything I鈥檝e seen before,5,,The gardens by the bay are simply incredible. They are unlike anything I have seen before. I unfortunately did not get there with enough time to explore the flower dome or cloud forest but just walking around the grounds and watching the light show was amazing on its own. I will definitely visit again.,,
,,Fantastic Attraction,5,,"We only had an afternoon and evening stop over in Singapore and you really need a whole day to walk around the extensive gardens, visit the awesome Cloud Forest, the beautiful Flower Dome, OCBC Skyway and Super Tree Grove. I particularly liked the Heritage Gardens but I had never seen anything as amazing as the Cloud Forest. The 35 metre mountain with walkways, waterfall, incredible planting and mist was fantastic. Stalactites and Stalagmites are featured inside as well as a video and interactive displays on saving our planet. You can buy a combined ticket for the two Conservatories $20 per adult, but the OCBC Skyway $8 and Shuttlebus $3 unlimited rides are charged separately. We did not stay for the light show as we had a booking at the Marina Bay which can be accessed directly from the gardens.",,
,,Beautiful must visit,5,,The garden is beautiful especially at night. It's best to visit in the evening and wait till sunset for amazing pictures.,,
,,Breathtaking,5,,"You have to see this place to believe it. Don't miss out on the two atriums with the waterfall, and flowers.",,
,,Nice view,4,,"The light show at night was awesome, really love walking around the park, i love the view, beautiful flowers, and the environment is clean. Don't miss it when in Singapore 鈽?
,,A Nice Place for an Evening Stroll,5.0,,Went here around 1930 on a week night. Decided to walk the outside gardens since they're free. Only the indoor gardens and Super Tree Bridge require a ticket. There is a light show beginning at 1945 which you can view from anywhere in the garden. Beat the crowd in the subway by charging your ticket beforehand. The lines after the show are quite long.
,,Beautiful Gardens,5.0,,Well you can鈥檛 go to Singapore without visiting Gardens by the Bay", very beautiful Gardens, I prefer to visit it in the afternoon so you can have the chance to watch the lights show that starts around 8:00pm
Overall experience is great.,,,,,,,
Notice," include cloud forest & flower dome in your visit because it鈥檚 a must.""",,,,,,
,,An attraction well worth a stroll around,4,,"Despite the rain that met us early during our short visit to Singapore (the sun shone the following day), it did not dampen our enthusiasm for what has been achieved at the Gardens by the Bay. The tall manufactured trees that characterise this venue mixed well with plants, shrubs and natural trees. There are lakes that provide a counterpoint to the vegetation and the walks are wide and well signed. Well worth the time to visit.",,
,,Worth visitng,5,,Skywalk was very good. Cloud walk there were massive queues. Lovely place to visit. Only 50 people allowed to walk on the walkway at any one time.,,
,,Amazing Gardens by the Bay,5,,"A fabulous place to visit whilst in Singapore. Most of the complex is free to visit. Charge is made for entry to the two 鈥渉ot houses鈥?and aerial walk. Signage good and provision of a map meant you didn鈥檛 miss a thing. Great to watch the kids run in and out of the fountain area, at least they kept cool, unlike the adults!! Wonderful location, took lots of photos. Worth a revisit.",,
,,A must to see in Singapore,5,,"Absolutely a must to visit, during the day and especially in the evening for the light show to classical music, take a blanket and watch while lying down!",,
,,Wonderful any time of day,5,,"We have just spent 4 days in Singapore and were recommended to go and see the Gardens by the Bay. On the first day we did the Skywalk between the trees in the Supertree Grove and walked around the gardens. In the evening we went into the Cloud Forest, which is amazing, especially at night, and then the Flower Dome. We didn't get to go up in the Marina Bay Sands hotel as we ran out of time.
At 7.45 and 8.45 in the evening there is a light show on the trees in Supertree Grove. Definitely worth waiting for.",,
,,Lovely Gardens,5,,Love visiting Gardens by the bay. In every occasion there seems to be something new! They are an asset to Singapore,,
,,Tourist,5,,Like Kew Gardens mashed up with the Eden Project - Brilliant! The cool domes are a refreshing breather from the tropical heat of SG,,
,,Sight Seeing Destination,5,,One of the best tourists attraction in Singapore where you could find an array of rare and exotic plants . They also hold flower shows in this place every year and other exciting events and photo contests. Their Giant Trees Grove is a sight you shouldnt miss visiting as well as the fliwer dome.,,
,,Beautifull,5,,"Do not miss the experience. It is a beautiful place, garden, promenade nearby Marina Bay Shopping Mall.",,
,,Worth a visit,5,,These are very extensive gardens which we visited for the evening sound and light festival. This was an excellent 15 minute free show which was spectacular.,,
,,Beautiful Gardens,5,,"Went to the evening light and music show one evening and visited the domes on other occasion. Both visits were truly memorable. Like the whole of Singapore, everywhere is spotlessly clean and very efficient. The Domes are good to visit on a hot day as the air con gives a lovely respite.
Access for limited mobility is good and directions easy to follow.
The admission price of 28 Singapore dollars is very good value.",,
,,A must attraction particularly at night.,5,,Visited last night to catch the free Super Tree Grove light and music show. There are two main attractions both air conditioned so a great place to stay cool Some fantastic plants and displays.,,
,,Magnificent!,5,,"Unbelievable how everything was built in the Gardens by the Bay. The concrete trees and the tropical forest are a must see. After 8PM starts the laser and lights show, also playing classical music. I've visited when it was inaugurated and again this time. Fantastic!!",,
,,VERY GOOD. WONDERFUL GARDENS & SKY WALK.,5,,A must visit whilst in Singapore. Beautiful gardens and amazing sculptures and walkway. The cafes could do with a bit of an update but it was exceptionally busy the day we were there so maybe the staff didn't have time to tidy up.,,
,,MUST VISIT,5,,"Go early and stay until night fall, then only u won't miss anything..take water n snacks with u.There is a lot of things to see..",,
,,Fantastic,5,,An evening walking around Gardens by the bay then taking in the light show 7.45 and 8.45pm is an evening well spent. The trees are spectacular and will get even better as the plants attached to them grow further. If in Singapore this is an experience not to miss. Lay backnlooknup and be amazed.,,

,,My go-to place for dating,5,,"Beautiful everywhere, and it's free for most of the Gardens; for a small price, you can get tickets into the flower domes too, which are air-conditioned and even more amazing. Decorated differently during different festivals/seasons too! Perfect for families, perfect for friends, perfect for couples all year round (in fact, GBTB is my go-to place for dating). Def not just a tourist trap. I mean, look at those supertrees. Wow.",,

,,Don't miss (free) light show at 7.45 pm,5,,This park is an unusual and wonderful experience. You can visit and wander around for free. Charges for the Skyway walk and visiting the domes. The light show with music at 7.45 every evening is a must. Beautiful.,,

,,Breathtaking Gardens,5,,"We made 2 visits to the Gardens, as they were celebrating the Christmas holidays with a special evening light show, then we returned to see the dome gardens. Definitely a must see while in Singapore, and a visit is easy from the cruise ship terminal.",,
,,Unusual,4,,Spent a couple of hours looking around these gardens and it鈥檚 definitely worth paying extra to visit the cloud dome and the flower dome. The cloud dome in particular is interesting with the waterfall but can be a bit chilly when you reach the top because of the cool mist that鈥檚 continually being sprayed. So many interesting flower and plant displays here and definitely worth a visit.,,
,,Beautiful,5,,Another must of SG. It is worthy going there and spend some of your time in the gardens exploring and taking pics.,,
,,Gorgeous!,5,,We enjoyed the beautiful displays of plants from around the world in one and a man made rainforest in the other. Get there early if you want to miss the crowds. We spend about 2 hours exploring both domes.,,
,,A garden experience not seen elsewhere.,5,,The wonderful world of air con under glass. To see such a variety of trees and plants growing happily but for us to walk around in an air conditioned envoironment was a treat. A really good treat.,,
,,"not to be missed , one of the best places we visited",5,,"easy to get to and very interesting, best to go late afternoon so that you see the lightshow at dusk.",,
,,a must visit,5,,"even if your not into garden, don't miss this attraction. it's a beautiful place to visit. its similar to the eden project but on a bigger scale. there are huge ecological trees with a high walk way. at night they are all lit up for a great sight.",,
,,Sensational,5,,A really fine place with excellent planting鈥檚 - a real tonic in this modern city. And it is free as well.,,
,,Must See,5,,"It was a fantastic experience for all age groups . Ideal time is to visit is evening, go have a Satey by the Bay and walk back to see the Gardens by the Bay",,
,,Truly a Garden City!,5,,"Especially love the Cloud Forest. It was also really cooling. Check out the flower dome, I heard that it changes every few month. I will definitely be back here with my family.",,
,,Absolutely stunning,5,,"We didn't really know what to expect but these gardens surpassed our expectations. We started by taking the ride around the gardens in the train, with commentary, which saved time and gave us a good idea of the layout. There are also two large domes - the flower dome (very colourful) and the Cloud dome (even more spectacular, with an indoor waterfall at the entry). Spend a wonderful day here and would thoroughly recommend it.",,
,,Interesting to visit,5,,"Great atmosphere, well maintained. Seasonal flowers are transported to the bay every now and then. Worth a visit especially when there are special events held such as CNY or Xmas.",,
,,Beautiful example of inspired urban development,5,,"Located across the motorway from the iconic Marina Bay Sands hotel and accessible through a tree-lined pedestrian overpass, the Gardens by the Bay include two large, futuristic-looking arboretums that house an extensive array of flowers and plants from around the world. Outdoors, visitors can also elect to go up to the world famous columns which look like alien tree-like structures and which have been planted with plant species from around the world that do not require any soil to thrive.

Plan to spend a whole morning or afternoon here.",,
,,Beautiful oasis,5,,"While in Singapore, it is a must to visit. It is an oasis you would like to explore. Be ready to stay in line, lots of people but it does worth it",,
,,Awesome Experience,5,,Took the evening tour - the lighted trees and music were delightful - you must do this in Singapore. Its a wonder!,,
,,Prepare your jogging shoe,4,,"This place is so huge. I was there with my 71 year old healthy grandma. We were walking from merlion statue to this garden. So many photographic venue along the way. when arrive in garden area, we were exhausted.
Really appreciated the effort to build such a dreamy garden.
The price feels a little too much for the experience.
Well it is worth it a visit once in a lifetime. I will not make second visit.",,
,,Love this place.,5,,What can I say totally loved this place . The gardens are split into different areas you鈥檝e good Chinese garden the dragon fly garden the silver garden and many more. The skywalk witch you pay for to walk between the trees witch gives you great views off the area . You can also go in the two domes for 28 dollars. It also has a light show . At night. 7.45 and 8.45 witch is very good . It鈥檚 right near mania bay sands hotel and shopping mail. So give a visit you won鈥檛 be disappointed.,,
,,A nice place to visit at night time before you go back to your hotel.,5,,A wonderful place to visit to walk around and see the lighting effects at night. Be sure that you have your camera with you to capture the beautiful sight. You must be at the area around 4:00 pm so you can likewise enjoy the other attractions and tourist spots before witnessing the marvelous lighting effects at the garden.,,
,,Incredible Gardens,5,,"This garden has a beautiful collection of plants and flowers. I went during a Dahlia exhibit that was incredibly gorgeous. The exhibit gardens are all covered so they are a great activity for when it is rainy - although there are also uncovered gardens. While pretty and a great walk for a nice day, the uncovered gardens are much less remarkable than the covered ones. I spent about 2-3 hours in the covered gardens, and then took a quick loop through the outdoor ones in about 40 minutes.

You can pay based on the amount of exhibits you want to see. I saw the dahlia exhibit, which was housed in an area that had regional garden displays from all over the world. I also saw their rainforest exhibit, which was called The Cloud I think. It had an incredibly impressive rock structure inside it that had a massive indoor waterfall, displaying flora from tropical areas - including many orchids.

I did spend some time walking through the outdoor gardens. It was a pleasant walk, and there was some interesting topiaries but other than that I found them unremarkable. They did have some very cool metal structures that resembled trees from which they displayed plants - and you could pay to walk among the ""tree"" tops (about 50 feet up). I didn't do this part of the garden.",,
,,Fantastic Gardens,5,,"Singapore Gardens by the Bay - what a fantastic venue this is, their ultimate goal to extend these gardens to surround the city with a garden forest seems a bit ambitious but when you see what they have done here anything is possible.
They are so well done that the wildlife attracted thinks so too we saw otters, an Eagle and various small native birds.The overhead walkway among the trees and the world's largest artificial waterfall in the cloud forest dome must be seen and is well worth the ticket price.
If you are going to Singapore this is a must

We visited the flower gardens in Dubai and found they were false artificial and a complete waste of time.",,
,,This is a must see in SG!,5,,"If you are in Singapore, this is a must see. I would visit the park when it's dark, if I had to pick between Day and night.",,
,,Must Visit,4,,Nice attraction. Cloud Forest was amazing and the light show at the end in the flower dome was good.,,
,,Magnificent garden!,5,,"As for me I am not a fan of botanic things, but here I was excited! In the evening (don`t remember time, around 7-8 pm), when the show with lights and classical music starts, you better to lay down on ground and I guarantee you will enjoy it!",,
,,Magical world,5,,"Lovely place for family. I visited Flower dome and cloud forest. Both have their own uniqueness. I like the place in different ways. flower dome looks boring in the beginning but after you explore more, it was unbelievably beautiful.",,
,,Light and Music Show is Gardens by the Bay,5,,"We enjoyed alot here. Look out for the music and lightshow ... its the best thing around the evening. Also all those who are scared of heights, please do not use the suspended overbridge. Thanks team for making our experience a wonderful one.",,
,,Must visit,5,,Nice in one of the spectacular places to enjoy hanging out Water dancing in light Places for shopping I really enjoyed sow nice,,
,,Artificial beauty,5,,"Better visit in the afternoon to dawn. So crowded in the weekend. Bought a ticket online and printed it so you dont have to wait in queue.
Very chill temperatur inside domes. Took 2.5 hours to complete 2 domes and supertree grove.
A must visit place when you go to Singapore",,
,,Shut up and take my money!,5,,I am just here to add a five star to this attraction. Really it is a MUST visit in Singapore. Go there at night when the Garden Rhapsody happens. Be there at 7:45pm or 8:45pm. Really...,,
,,Lovely way to spend an afternooon/evening,5,,Worth staying till the evening for the light show. Also Satay by the Bay was a good cheaper alternative for food,,
,,A must see place in Singapore,5,,"Definitly visit the jungle part and flowers part inside the Gardens by the bay, the waterfall is amazing. Also you should see the largest trees inside the park as well...",,
,,Wonderful gardens,4,,"Does exactly what is says on the tin. A very large greenhouse full of flowers.

It鈥檚 a little more than that. These are indeed fabulous gardens full of trees, bushes and various plants from around the world. They are very well kept and very pretty. There are lots of garden ornaments too which are tastefully done.

A very good visit. My only negative observation would be that it was smaller than I expected.

We bought a ticket for both this and the sky gardens which were good value at about 拢14 pp.

Top tip go here earlier in the day. After 11am it starts to get busy.",,
,,Lovely,3,,"The garden was lovely and the atmosphere was just great,you can take lots of pictures and the view from the top is remarkable.",,
,,Organised but in a strange way,3,,"We had a light lunch at the Gardens By the Bay. The restaurant was set up to process a large number of guests very rapidly, and ordering involved completing a large checklist of dishes. Service was efficient but not friendly. The food was moderately good.",,
,,Not to be missed.,5,,What a beautiful place to be on a balmy evening. There is no end of visual stimulation. The smells are wonderful and no matter where you walk or look there is something else that makes you gasp. Well worth a visit in the day time as well. The feeling within the gardens is one of great pleasure. Met some people who had been there over 10 hours. So much to do and see. Not to be missed,,
,,Must See!,5,,"Highly reccomend going to see the gardens! Absolutely stunning and not too badly priced, around $30 to enter both domes and then the rest of the gardens are free!",,
,,Simply gorgeous,4,,What a fantastic day out for all ages. They really have catered to everyone. We were dispointed by the food options but thoroughly enjoyed walking around and exploring the gardens. The two indoor exhibit were a nice relief to the heat.,,
,,A Singapore MUST,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is such a unique experience I would say it is a MUST if you find yourself in Singapore. It is an oasis like none other set apart from the concrete jungle of the city. You can explore much of the property for free, but the tickets for the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome are definitely worth it. Take the time to enjoy the beauty, relax and get some steps in. You will not regret it!",,
,,Relaxing and interesting,5,,"Two huge conservatory domes dominate the Gardens by the Bay, but it鈥檚 actually a collection of public spaces, attractions and planting, covering three sides of the waterfront beyond the harbour. You have to pay for entrance to the domes and the walkway up in the Supertree Grove, but everything else is free. There鈥檚 a great park/botanical garden beyond the Supertree Grove. It鈥檚 a great place to escape the craziness of the city and relax a little. You can find yourself walking for some time, so make make sure you are prepared.",,
,,A must do,5,,Used the hop on hop off bus to get there. It is well worth a visit and the flower dome is very impressive. Really enjoyed it. Remember if you travel Singapore Airlines keep your boarding pass as it gets you discounts at several places including the hop on hop off bus and entry to the gardens.,,
,,Excellent,5,,"Depending on the weather and the time you have, you could easily spend three to four hours here. You can purchase your tickets to just visit the Flower Dome, the Cloud Dome or both. The Flower Dome is comfortable after being out in the heat. There is a restaurant in that Dome. The Cloud Dome, can feel chilly and there is a constant water mist in the atmosphere. For the active and adventurous, you can spend at least an hour or more in that Dome. Snacks and drinks can be purchased outside the Domes as well as toilets. It pays to go in the late afternoon, if you want to see the light and music show outside the Domes. We travelled by taxi both ways from our hotel for between $10 to $13 each way. The Flower Dome is more sedate of the two. There is a motorized conveyence that takes you around the outdoor garden area but we didn't do that, due to time, weather and endurance. The cost for both Domes was $28 each.",,
,,Lunar New Year with Dahlia dreams @ Flower Dome,4,,It was a great afternoon walk in the flower dome with my Taiwanese friend whose first time in Singapore. Great impression created as the flowers are calming and the views where stunning. The cloud forest is the highlight as usual. One of the must visit attraction in Singapore!,,
,,Amazing Cloud Forest,5,,"As I was a Singaporean. I got the tickets via the direct website. It was my first time at GBTB paid observatories, it was an amazing experience with loads of instagram opportunities. Besides that, the attraction was well curated with an bang to the ending; where an environmental video was played on loop to remind us that without Earth, there would not be us. :)

It is a must visit for foreigners; it truly brings out the essence of garden city in Singapore. Do visit satay by the bay; a 10 mins walk away from cloud forest attraction, and relish in local delights.

p.s : Singaporeans Klook is not the cheapest, Book Direct",,
,,Majestic Gardens!,5,,"A must do activity when you are in Singapore. The gardens are huge and it takes a lot of walking but worth it. Since we reached by late evening, the skywalk was closed but you can enjoy the lights of the amazing gardens. We also came the next day and saw the gardens in the daylight but were again unlucky since we could not get to the skywalk as it was closed due to rain-like weather. Overall a beautiful place to visit and enjoy nature.",,
,,City Gardens,5,,"These gardens are great, away from the hustle and bustle of a busy city, we found them a delight and a nice place to relax, in our opinion well worth a visit.",,
,,incredible,5,,"Arrived there around 7 pm, visited both domes and i was so lucky to experience the light show later on. Loved it.",,
,,Brilliant - don鈥檛 miss it,5,,Arrived around 1800 and had time to do the Skyway (bit scarey) and the flower dome (amazing) before the light show at 1945. Light show was amazing - the whole park is a brilliant creation - don鈥檛 miss it!,,
,,"Green, Gorgeous and Great",5,,"Brilliant display of flora from around the world. Magnificently displayed and maintained. Easy for all the family to navigate, stroller friendly. Flower Dome is impressive with all the floral arrangements. Plenty of eateries and public facilities. Excellent light show at 7:45pm to finish off the day. Well worth the money, time and effort.",,
,,A night trip to the Gardens by the bay!,5,,"Brought my cousin's family from Taiwan to visit GBB. Nice flowers! Beautifully decorated with Chinese new year flowers! Took many photos of the flowers. Nice ambience, cooling!",,
,,Fantastic fantacy world,5,,"This is a mount dropping place. A must see if you are in Singapore. It was very humid, but this is an amazing place.",,
,,Great walk.,4,,This is a must. The area is free to visit and you only pay to enter some of the green houses.You can walk to the barrier meeting the sea and get a good view.,,
,,Magical Gardens Day or Night,5,,Definitely a must see when in Singapore. The gardens are magnificent and the beautiful carvings and statues are all worth the visit. The two Domes were amazing to wander through...give yourself heaps of time to explore.,,
,,Fantastic experience,5,,"They have created a wonderful place, the Cloud Forest especially. Never been to anywhere like it and so enviromental. The tree walk is also a great experience and the free light show a lovely way to see this place later in the day",,
,,A Must,5,,"This was one of the things we planned when visiting Singapore.

We purchased our tickets at our Hotel for $25 dollars each but look online you can save a few dollars.

My big tip is go later in the afternoon & stay for the light show! You pay for entry to the domes which have indoor waterfalls & beautiful flowers! Wear comfortable shoes plenty of walking to be done!

You do have to buy a ticket to go on the walkway around the trees! You can be up there when the light show is on!

It is a truly beautiful show set to music, find yourself a comfortable spot!

A fab little secret is in the flower dome there is a little cafe called Pollen! We ordered sour dough bread with hummus with smoked butter! It was amazing, not expensive! Give it a try",,
,,Singapore sets the bar higher,5,,"We have traveled to Singapore many times, and enjoyed all the great events and attractions they offer (Yea F1!)...but Gardens by the Bay, once again, tops everything to date. The cloud Forest is simply monumentally awesome - this is the new ""must do"" for anyone visiting Singapore",,
,,Heaven on Earth !!,5,,"This is beautiful, awesome, fabulous!! As if this is heaven on earth with all the beauty and peace . A fantastic presentation by Singapore !! Well done !!",,
,,Beautiful gardens,4,,"Definitely worth a visit. We arrived late in the afternoon which enabled us to see the gardens, have dinner at Satay by the Bay and then enjoy the light show in the evening.",,
,,Beautiful!,5,,"This was an amazing place to visit and offered great cover from the downpour of rain outside. There was plenty to look at while staying cool and dry. Not sure I鈥檇 go twice, but it was definitely worth one trip.",,
,,Amazing domes and views.,5,,"I have to say that I was a little underwhelmed by the gardens when taken on their own: too much concrete, too few areas to relax. HOWEVER, the greenhouses and 'supertrees' are truly exceptional. And this is without seeing them at night either, when, from I have seen, the latter are lit up to spectacular effect. The cloud forest in particular was a favourite of mine, combining waterfalls with looping walkways and greenery on almost every available surface. And the supertrees really do look like some alien species from the Avatar films. From both of these areas there are also wonderful views over the rest of the park, the Marina Bay Sands and towards the rest of the city. I thoroughly recommend going when in Singapore.",,
,,Wow!nd rest weary feet,5,,"One of the great attractions in this wonderful city and worth spending a considerable amount of time exploring all the many and varied gardens and zones.
Depending on the time of your visit, consider booking online as this can save standing for a significant time in queues at the ticket office. Getting there is easy by bus or MRT...the latter does involve a considerable walk though.
Recommended for a visit - comfortable footwear as there is a lot of walking, fully charged camera/ mobile phone batteries, a bottle of water and if you are a keen gardener, a notebook and pen!
There is so much to see and fortunately plenty of places to sit and rest weary feet! There's a number of national gardens to explore with very helpful information notices explaining the significance of each garden. Most popular are the two zones - cloud forest and flower - and the Supertrees complete with skywalk.
The Cloud zone is incredible and look out for the various sculptures within the planting. Inclines are gradual and there is a lift almost to the top. Whoever created this zone was a genius. The Flower zone often has seasonal themes and displays plants from around the world. Again there are different scultures around which add to the interest.
The Supertrees are particularly attractive in the evening. If the weather permits, it is worth paying an additional fee to visit the skywalk between the Supertrees. There are fantastic panoramic views of Singaporefrom the skywalk.
There are a number of restaurants/cafes within the gardens as well as a well stocked gift shop. Staff are very friendly and helpful and a visit here will provide a host of memories!",,
,,Chill,5,,"Well worth the visit, surprised by how relaxing it was walking through and checking out the different gardens.",,
,,Very cool trees. Worth seeing at night for the light show,5,,The gardens are pretty big and totally worth seeing. we went at dusk but unfortunetly were too late in the evening to get on the cloud walk. We did get to see the light show at night and it was amazing.,,
,,Must Do Singapore,5,,"This was our favourite thing to do in Singapore. Close to the Marina Bay Sands precinct, connected by a walkway, or along the river or via MRT, it is easy to get to and great to spend a morning, an afternoon or a whole day exploring.

Wandering along the water, in amongst the various free gardens or visiting the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest - both of which we highly recommend - all provide a great experience and highlight when in Singapore.

We would also recommend walking out to the end of the path near the harbour - some great views of the many ships waiting to come into port, the floating bridge in the man-made reservoir and some unique pieces of outdoor art all await.

Don't miss wandering around Gardens by the Bay. You won't be disappointed.",,
,,Don't miss this architectural wonder!,5,,You have to make a trip to Gardens By the Bay. It is a marvel to see the variety of flora that they can grow in the temperature environment .,,
,,Good couple of hours,4,,Nice place. Not that much to do for kids (as in interactive play) although kids enjoyed cloud forest. Good place to kill a couple of hours. Really just beautiful man made gardens to walk around.,,
,,Loved it,5,,"Best attraction of Singapore,its really amazing too see a forest in the middle of city ! Loved the place,good for relaxing..you can easily spend half to whole day !",,
,,Marvellous place,5,,Had a pretty good time in both the domes. The rain forest dome is my favourite. Though didn't had time to roam the entire length of gardens as the bus service is closed by around 5 pm but the night light show was great. The OCBC sky walk too was missed due to bad weather but still this a must visit place.,,
,,Super experience !,5,,"Called during a day in Singapore, Great to see all the plants etc. Very well layed out on different levels, walkways etc. Great wat to pass a couple of hours.",,
,,An amazing garden in a concrete jungle,4,,"A must do in Singapore.

We took the hop on hop off bus there and only just made the last bus out we were enjoying it that much.
The gardens are stunning, the waterfall is quite simply amazing and it鈥檚 so easy to forget the high rises outside.

Make sure you see it",,
,,Amazed!,5,,Beautiful design of the area and lovely musical lights at the evening. People laying down around the area to listen and watch the lights.,,
,,Emotional,5,,"After a trip to Cambodia and a long expected flight home to the UK, we were very pleased that Singapore airport offered a free tour of the city, and even to get off the bus! The Gardens by the Bay was the final stop of the tour and is probably one of the best things I have ever witnessed with my own eyes. Very moving and they put on an exceptional show, our tour guide and many other citizens are very proud of this and they should be. Moved me to tears",,
,,Beautiful Gardens,5,,Worth visiting this garden. Need lot of time to spend. and one should be able to walk to visit the Gardens. We took the Audio train which was for 15 minutes and were able to cover a lot,,
,,Very interesting,5,,Great place to visit and love the night show magic its a must you will not be disappointed it'a magical day or night fantastic viewing platform as well enjoy,,
,,Jungle paradise,5,,"The greenest garden in the middle of a city. You have access to the gardens in so many ways. You can access easily to the attractions as cloud forest or the flower dome. They all are worthy to be visited. And for residents, it's a great escape with kids or to read a book.",,
,,Amazing!,5,,"Access the gardens by the bay through the rear of the Marina Bay Sands, from the moment you approach this area you are dumbstruck with complete awe and fascination at the amazing structure firstly of the hotel which seems to have become the most famous landmark of Singapore! Then you see the marvellous tree like structures of the gardens by the bay which at night change colour by fabulous light changes.

Up close the tree like structures are very intricate with plants growing intertwined into the structure itself.

It was very busy when we visited which was mid afternoon and would recommend visiting before the crowds arrive and a second visit at night.

It rained heavily during our visit around 3 or 4pm which seemed to be the norm each day we were in Singapore so recommend taking an umbrella or waterproof jacket. We hadn鈥檛 as with many other tourists and so jostled for space under a small canopy at the entrance to a lift so as not to be soaked to the skin.

This is the only downside to visiting in that there is no where to cover from the heavy rain.",,
,,Magnificent,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is amazing and a definite must do if spending a couple of days in Singapore. It is also really close to the cruise terminal so easy to do if you only have a couple of hours. A blue taxi from the cruise terminal would be approx $10. Like everything in Singapore this has been created with great planning, care & expertise. Beautiful sculptures around every corner.",,
,,Amazing Attraction,5,,"GBTB are really impressive. There is so much to see so allow plenty of time. Also expect to do a lot of walking.

The super tree Grove is creative. The skywalk is OK but not a must. If you do pay to go up beware there is a 15 min time limit, but it's a reasonable time allowance.

The conservatories, Cloud Forest and Flower Dome, are amazing and worth the $28pp ticket. You don't have to be a nature lover to enjoy the 2 conservatories.

If there is a chance of rain then plan to do the conservatories when it's raining.

There is a shuttle bus ($8pp) which does a circuit of the GBTB which is great if it's hot and/or you are fatigued or mobility impaired.",,
,,Its was great,4,,"We traveled here with 7 people, and ended up by losing 1 people because the area is so large. After almost an hour looking for him, we finally found him though.
So, if you are traveling with many people, stay close with them.

Its a great place after all, alot of beautiful plants, and the view was amazing from the top.",,
,,Stunning. And hot!,5,,"This is an absolute must see. If you鈥檙e short on $, then wander round the free bits and just enjoy the sights. We spent $8 each to go up to the OCBC skyway. My husband was a bit worried about getting up to there as he鈥檚 not brilliant at stairs these days, but no worries, there鈥檚 a lift. I loved it, but maybe it鈥檚 not the best if you鈥檙e not happy at heights. There鈥檚 plenty of places to eat and drink dotted round. The queues are shortest away from McDonalds! Take your time, drink plenty of water. And take your camera!",,
,,Nice afternoon walk,4,,Here we can see the highlights of Singapore. Nice breeze on the afternoon and you can see the light show at 6pm.,,
,,Wonderful Attraction,5,,"These are fantastic gardens with lots to do, but you need a few hours here to get it all done. The Domes are an amazing mix of varity of gardens. Also lovely at night. a must if you visit Singapore!",,
,,Nice..,3,,"Nice place to spend the evening with family. Biking, strolling casually, playing water in their lovely waterpark. Always love to go back..",,
,,Brilliant,5,,Highly recommended especially the cloud Forrest Dome and OCBC skyway. Lovely day out. Whatever you do don't eat in the Bakerzin restaurant which is located in the park with a monopoly. It is the worst.,,
,,Absolutely beautiful!,5,,I spent a whole day there and could have spent another day. An amazing place that I would highly recommend.,,
,,Good park to walk in the evening!,5,,"This is very nice park which you definitely need to visit during your Singapore stay. Lots of trees and flowers, good gift shop with real flowers which you may buy and to plant at home.",,
,,Magnificent.,5,,"This is a ""must visit"" place in Singapore. The gardens are absolutely stunning. There is even a South African garden.",,
,,Totally amazing!,5,,"Seemed expensive when we went in, but it was worth every penny! It is really interesting and we learned such a lot.",,
,,Christmas display visit,4,,Great evening Christmas display of lights and music. Huge crowds however very well organised. MRT very close by.,,
,,Wonderful evening out,5,,"We spent the evening here, having dinner at the street market food centre. A pleasant stroll round ending up at the light show which was spectacular. The music went well with the show and was enjoyed by all ages around us.
Only difficulty was finding the way out afterwards .. no clear signs at all.",,
,,tropical paradise,5,,"What a breath of fresh (green) air amongst the sky rise buildings. Its beautifully crafted, tranquil and absolutely stunning.",,
,,Great day at the Gardens,5,,"This is a must see place. The flower dome is breathtaking and the Cloud dome is spectacular. You can lose a lot of time in this place, so much to see and it鈥檚 well worth spending the time there. We also went up to the Rooftop bar at the Supertree and it was just glorious sitting there and watching the sunset.",,
,,Great,5,,You must see!!! Well organized and well maintained. I have to say that Rainforest dome is fascinating but expect large que.,,
,,Christmas at gardens by the bay,5,,"Last time we visited just as the gardens were opening a few years ago . This time as our children were older we did both of the domes , both were very contrasting . If you do not like heights like myself I would not recommend the cloud dome! My husband and my daughters on the other hand loved it
We didn鈥檛 spend as much time in the actual gardens as we covered them in our last visit but did return for the nightly light show at the super tree grove which I would highly recommend especially against the backdrop of the marina bay sands
There are ample food choices and eating establishments here to suit all tastes and budgets
Our visit was only marred by rude staff in the gift shop that tidied areas as we were looking so we didn鈥檛 buy anything , a great shame . I did provide feedback via their FB Page and to be fair they did address the points raised and apologise profusely
The children鈥檚 area is closed Monday so if you have little ones be mindful of this as my daughters loved their time there . Make sure your children take togs and a towel as it鈥檚 a great way to cool down",,
,,Well worth a visit!,5,,"This is a huge area which is free to wander round,however if you want to access the domes (Flower Dome and Forest) or the Skyway ,you have to pay. They are well worth it as there are endless photo opportunities and the waterfall is amazing. There are numerous cafes and reastaurants which serve a variety of food and drink. You also get good views of the adjacent boat shaped hotel(The Marina Bay Sands), which rises high into the sky offering panoramic views(at a cost!) and a garden which is accessible to hotel guests only. If you intend to use the restaurant at the top you can buy a reduced ticket.
To avoid a long walk in the heat to access the domes,you can buy a ticket for the shuttle bus. The gardens are easily accessed by the underground railway.

and the Skyway",,
,,Marvelous experience,5,,"The Hardens by the Bay consists of a park accommodating so called super trees, lakes and channels and two covered gardens. Everything is to some extent surrealistic- huge artificial trees with lights and connecting bridges and covered gardens without any limit of imagination. It looks that all possible has been done here what can be done, and the budget has been only a secondary issue.

The Gardens are directly linked to Bayfront metro station, Marina Sands Hotel and Marina Bay Shopping Mall.",,
,,a must do excursion,5,,"we did gardens by bay at night and watched light show, this was excellent , you will have to pay extra to walk on skybridge but worth doing.",,
,,Serene beauty,5,,Loved walking here in the mornings. Once I discovered this place I was in love with the beauty. I鈥檓 not a person that would be interested in looking at flower gardens but wow. This place is spectacular. I loved it all. Don鈥檛 leave Singapore if you haven鈥檛 checked out this place,,
,,A Fascinating Place T Visit,5,,A really well done artistic treat. Well worth the money we spent over 2.5 hours just walking around. A refreshing approach to a modern garden park. One of the highlights of Singapore,,
,,Just Amazing,5,,"Fabulous Botanical gardens, some of it is free including the evening lightshow, which is just amazing. You have to pay to get into the big domes, but they are well worth the money. Also very educational about global warming etc.",,
,,Must visit,4,,Must visit when in singapor are vibrant in evening full of lights spend an evening here to enjoy the bestof singapore,,
,,Good to visit,4,,Went on tour of Gardens by the Bay and saw the cloud forest and flower Some conservatories. Cloud forest (waterfall and misting was very interesting). Flower dome was not as interesting,,
,,Not what I expected,3,,"When I heard about the gardens I've been so excited to get there but maybe I didn't see what everybody was raving about because I thought it was good but not spectacular.
I love plants and have a green thumb so was looking forward to exotic type of plants and an abundance of color. I'm glad I went but won't need to go again any time soon.",,
,,Beautiful Oasis in a Busy City,5,,"A huge and beautiful gardens that you can spend hours walking around. The highlight are the two domes that you pay to get in. They are magnificent. Don't miss the important messaging from the videos that are presented in a video room.

If you don't want to pay the money for the domes, you will miss a good experience, but it will still be a spectacular memory if you just walk around everything available outside!!",,
,,Nice but crowded,3,,The lights at night were nice. The indoor rain forest was very crowded. The outdoor gardens was nice.,,
,,Fun light show!,4,,"Fun light show at night, but perhaps the show at Marina Bay Sands is more impressive? This one took 15 minutes in total and were mostly accompanied by Asian music.",,
,,Interesting place to see at night during Christmas season,5,,Interesting place to see at night during Christmas season. Great lighted decorations. It's under the iconic Marina Bay Sands Hotel so there is a great view from under the spaceship looking hotel,,
,,Afternoon tea at Pollen.,5,,"Although we had some confusion with our booking the service we received when we arrived at Pollen was good.
Afternoon tea is a modern version and very relaxing.
Our tea price included entry into the flower dome which is well worth a visit.
The gardens are stunning when lit up at night.",,
,,Loved the flowerscape and the waterfall,5,,The flower dome was wonderful. Loads of flowerscapes using both local and foreign flowers. The forest dome next door has a wonderful 75 foot waterfall. Both are very busy as expected.,,
,,Superb Architectural Design,5,,"Must visit place in Singapore, Average duration it takes 3-4 hrs to completely visit it.
Has a small kids zone with water park activity if you are travelling with kids do take extra cloths.
Both Flower Dome & Cloud Forest are must to do activity.
Best part is Light & Sound Show at Super tree grove.",,
,,Nice place to visit!,5,,"We visited gardens in the bay and went to the cloud forest which was nice. The light show was good but it is definately better on the otherside of the bay for the light and water show.
Restaurants are fairly priced and they have happy hours!
Nice evening out very well kept attraction.",,
,,Spectacular Gardens by The Bay Singapore,4,,"Visited both domes which is the Cloud Forest & Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay in Singapore recently with my son. The Cloud Forest has magnificent rare plants & flowers. There are many levels inside the dome. I have height phobia so I only went up to Level 3 which is my limit. There were mists from sprinklers above which made you feel as if you are in the clouds looking down hence the name. I took hundreds of pictures of rare orchids, ferns, bromeliads, pitcher plants etc. Not forgetting the 35 metre waterfall inside the dome. It was spectacular with plants peeping out of the waterfall from behind.
Entering the Flower Dome was another unforgettable experience. As Chinese New Year is next week, dahlia was the chosen flower to mark this auspicious occasion. I joined the garden tour to learn about the dahlias and other flowers as well. There are a couple of small bridges and entrances to palaces to set the mood in ancient China to celebrate the year of the Dog.
I recommend both these attractions and destination to visitors who are fanatic gardeners and flower enthusiasts. You will love the experience as I have. Don't miss it or you will regret it when in Singapore.",,
,,"Spectacular Supertrees, amazing nature walk, mesmerizing domes",4,,The entry to the garden is free. There are many supertrees and you can walk through the super grove for free. However there are tickets to go up on the walkway through these supertrees. There is also a dining/bar on the top of one of the super trees. There is additional tickets to go to the flower dome and the cloud dome. It is a very nice place for the nature lovers.,,
,,A beautiful experience,5,,Definitely a place to visit. The gardens are beautiful & make sure you do the Skyway walk & definitely visit the Flower dome & Cloud dome. The cloud dome has a brilliant waterfall. You would think it鈥檚 hot & humid inside but it鈥檚 quiet cool. A pleasant feeling from the warm humid weather outside. Places there to eat too. We had a nice lunch at Peach Garden restaurant.,,
,,Unique & amazing,5,,"Amazing place to visit & not a regret. Worth your money either for this place, transport & food. This place totally amaze me with their gardens & how they build it. Cool & cozy place. Friendly staff & cleanliness is super amazing!",,
,,Good option to visit to cool down and enjoy the flowers,4,,Accessible though the MTR but still a walk from the station to the gates of the site. Great place to spend a few hours to enjoy greenery without sweating in the humid weather of SINGAPORE.,,
,,Different!,4,,Difficult to review this location as we found it difficult to find our way around as much was closed by the time we arrived (mid evening) but the 'son et luminier' show was very good. You don't need to pay entry fee to see this as it is clearly visible throughout the parkland surrounding the Gardens themselves.,,
,,a MUST do in Singapore!,5,,"We only had one day in Singapore and I don't have a single regret spending it at Gardens by the Bay! We went during the day and visited both the Cloud Forest & Flower Dome which are two great indoor activities considering we visited in rainy season and it was pouring down! We then later revisited at night to see The Supertree Grove lit up and it was just as magic as in the day.
Despite the rain, and the light show being cancelled, and the rooftop bar being closed due to the stormy conditions, the experience was amazing. And it's all more reason to return again one day.",,
,,Highlight of my trip,5,,The night show was honestly the best experience. I was there during the Christmas period and the light show was synced to Christmas carols and it was a one in a life time experience. Would definately come back anytime,,
,,A must see place,5,,"Even if you are in Singapore for a couple of days, do take the time to visit. Very well maintained, and clean. Must see venue.",,
,,A unique and memorable experience,5,,"We visited here as part of an organised tour which took in the light show at night and we returned on another day to view the Cloud Forest Dome and the Flower Dome as well as walk through the gardens and admire them during the dat. Truly magnificent and worth the time and effort. The whole experience is worth a full day to really appreciate the amazing horticultural, engineering, climate friendly and energy saving strategies thAt are demonstrated here. It is really worth doing the organised tour because it saves money and also because the guides do give a great and important perspective on what there is to know about this amazing project that is located entirely on reclaimed land. A tribute to the ingenuity of the Singaporean people.",,
,,"Interesting, good to visit on a hot day as its aircon",4,,"Interesting, nice gardens, cool and pleasant stroll
Rather ironic, the emphasis on the green agenda in the educational sections but looking at the place, running air con 24/7 and the use of steel, concrete and manufactured items to construct it seems rather a case of the pot calling the kettle black
No orchids on display though Singapore is famous for its orchids so this seemed odd. You can catch a rickshaw bicycle ride or walk to Marina Bay Sands and take a $20 trip to the top rooftop bar to have a drink and view the bay and surrounds. A glass of Veuve Cliquot was $40 but the $20 lift ticket gets deducted off that",,
,,One of the best gardens of the world,5,,"Amazing place.. though Singapore is a city of gardens,this is a special place.. the outside park is free for all..i find so many local people used to come here for a walk..the 3 main gardens are cloud forest,flower dom and supertree groove...all are unique in terms of architecture and beauty of nature..a must visit for Singapore travellers..",,
,,Fantastic!,5,,"This was our lasting memory of Singapore and if you don't do anything else, you must do this! Go about 6.30pm and get a good seat, the light show and music starts at 7.30pm and it is well worth the wait.",,
,,Stunning,5,,"Honeymooned for 3 weeks across Asia and the Cloud Garden was one of our top highlights from the entire trip!

Make sure to be there for one of the misting sessions (every 2 hours I believe) so as to experience the 'being in the clouds' effect.

Fascinating and thought provoking display and presentation on the way out all about the effects of climate change.

Most definitely worth a visit for a few hours.

Enjoyed the Flower Garden and displays from all continents.

Super Trees are amazing too, even more impressive at night for the light show - although does get crowded at night so head down a few minutes early to get a decent spot.",,
,,Most amazing place,5,,A must visit. Beautiful all round. Mark sure you visit the Cloud dome. We presented and a magical place at night.,,
,,Spectacular,5,,"It was really interesting wandering around the exhibits, including the flower dome and cloud forest. The suspended path 7 stories high in the cloud forest was particularly worthwhile experiencing. The best time to go is late afternoon so you are there for the spectacular light show just after dark.",,
,,Flowers,4,,"The Gardens were superb, beautifully set there is a fee to get up onto the walk way of the gardens $8 Singaporean dollars but worth it also payment is required to see flowers within the Dome. Otherwise there is plenty to do without paying walking around the gardens enjoying dews.",,
,,Spectacular and Impressive,5,,"My title sums up what I thought of this place, it is not only beautiful, green, well kept and amazing but also ecological and a feat of engineering. It is astounding by day with an empressive collection of flora nd fauna but at night it turns into a beautifully lit magical and romantic place. The free musical light show which can be viewed from the bridge into the Marina Bay Hotel or under the 'Supertrees' which are spectacular water towers and solar installations as well as feats of engineering. There is a restaurant in one of them and a walkway bridge in another. The views of the city and Marina Bridge hotel from here were just...well...amazing! If you go to Singapore you just HAVE to go and see them!",,
,,Great attention to detail....pretty gardens.,5,,"This is built on 'reclaimed land', which seems to mean Singapore wanted more land to use for the city so they filled in the sea and built this upon it. In the Cloud Forest, which is also on this site...there are a number of short films outlining humans negative impacts on the environment. I thought that was ironic given how the place was built. However..... it is a unique set of gardens with a series of massive steel 'super trees' in the centre of it. They have plants growing up the outsides as well. Massive structures and there is an elevated platform you can pay $8 to go up an elevator and walk from one super tree to the next. The paths of gardens around the super trees are lovely to walk on. There is one very big super tree in the centre of all of them that one can go up and have an overpriced lunch. We did go up and had a draft beer...they were $20 for the local Tiger beer. At least they served it in a frosted glass. Lol.",,
,,Amazing experience,5,,"My main delight was the cloud forest, one can loose oneself in there for hours there is so much to see &learn. The theatre gives us a stern warning of what will happen to our planet by 22,000 if we don't change our view of climate control.
The Flower dome was beautiful with sections worldwide. We completed our visit with the skywalk where you gave a wonderful view of the park & Singapore shoreline.",,
,,"A lovely day out, but cyclists are a danger.",4,,"The gardens are very big, with well designed paths and walkways throughout. The domed gardens prices are quite expensive but are lovely to walk around. The Satay by the Bay restaurants are reasonably priced with a great selection of foods and drinks. I鈥檓 a heavy guy and found the walking a bit tough, and noticed a lot of other visitors taking regular seating breaks. The light show at night is worth seeing and very atmospheric. Just be prepared for a lot of walking, sometimes amongst Joggers and Cyclists, some who ride VERY FAST",,
,,Fantastic,5,,"A wonderful place, both day and evening. The whole area has been transformed and the light show in the evening is spectacular to watch. The gardens are wonderful and the special domes must be seen. A very special area around the hotel with shops, bars and restaurants. Do try and take active cruise in the evening.",,
,,Lack halal dining options,3,,"I recommend visiting this place both in the morning when it is not too hot, and in the evening to watch the elegant lightings and the gardens rhapsody. The gardens rhapsody is a music and light entertain that is really worth watching. Whilst the scenery and flower dome is nice to be admired, I find this place lacking in terms of halal food options. There are only 2 halal food options here - MacDonalds and Texas Chicken - both being fast food type. For Muslim travellers, if you don鈥檛 like fast food, you will have to go elsewhere for a meal. Nearby - there are Marina Bay Sands (not much options for halal food) and Sate by The Bay (a food court; the halal stalls seems to open only after 4pm when I last visited).",,
,,Worth visiting,4,,We had a great morning walking round gardens seeing the wide range of exotic plants. Worlds tallest indoor waterfall and walking a forest in the clouds.,,
,,Impressive,5,,"Not really inter step in gardens but as this was listed as the number one place to visit I thought we would give it a go. It's free to walk around and it's really good, I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed our visit and I can see why it's so popular. I would recommend you visit this place even if you are not into gardens.",,
,,Beautiful Oasis in the heart of Singapore,4,,You need at least 3 hours in this place and its always best to avoid the midday sun. I recommend going early evening and then you can see the light show at 7.45 or 8.45. Some excellent views and the supertrees are amazing.,,
,,Beautiful and spectacular,5,,Visited Gardens of the Bay and we were not disappointed. The beautiful trees and plants were amazing. We particularly enjoyed the Cloud Forest which was spectacular.,,
,,Lush and so green,4,,"Beautiful location next to Marina Bay and along the waterfront with great views of the city. Even if you don鈥檛 want to pay to go into the domes just a walk along the front and admiring all the trees, plants and sculptures. They even have otters to see. The plants and flowers and trees in the dome are superb just so well done and well taken care off. Places to sit and eat and drink too. Would have been nice to see at night so next time will try that.",,
,,Fantastic place,5,,"Must visit when in Singapore
Better at night but just as good during the day . You don鈥檛 need to do the cloud dome or flower dome if you don鈥檛 want to spend money . Be careful though avoid 8 or 9 m when the light show us in as it gets really busy",,
,,Loved the gardens,5,,"The gardens continue to rejuvenate itself with wonderful displays, lovely thematic flower arrangements. Love the souvenir shop that offers seeds for green fingers.",,
,,Amazing!,5,,Not to be missed - especially the light show at 7.45 and 8.45 pm. Take a blanket to lie down and wonder at the sights.,,
,,gardeners pardice,5,,even if you only have a small interst in plants this is a must to visit i have worked the royal botanic gardes kew there four my intrest in plants is higer than most people the plant numbers and layout is excellent thies gardens are well worth the visit,,
,,Amazing experience,5,,The blending of nature and man-made structures works very well. I walked the Skyway; up by lift and then went down via the stairs which allows you to see just how the plants are attached to the structure. Also the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. They are not to be missed. The range of plants and trees plus the climate control inside the massive structures is amazing. I didn't spend much time in the actual gardens; maybe on another visit.,,
,,Impressive gardens,3,,"Definitely worth a visit - although we went in daytime and I think it would be better at night when all lit up.
Very spectacular set-up the way it is all set up and a relaxing place to walk around.
A benefit of going during the.day is you will have great views over Singapore from the trees...but of course you can also get even better from top of the Marina Bay (boat).
Unfortunately it started to rain a bit when we went up our first tree and the staff had to order everyone off the bridges and down to ground level - so our excursion was cut short.",,
,,Flower and Cloud Domes were great.,5,,"I first went here in 2013 and was a little underwhelmed, however, it was relatively new then, its really developed now and we had a lovely time exploring both the Domes. It was a busy day there, but it all went smoothly. Lovely to have that lovely temperature in there on a warm and humid day in Singapore.",,
,,Stunning attraction,5,,We spent a whole afternoon going through the two biodomes and wandering around the grounds and looking at the different gardens. This is an amazing attraction and was a real highlight of our trip to Singapore. The laser show in the SuperTree Grove is a must do also. Lying on your back enjoying the light show with music was exceptional. Would definitely recommend this to anyone visiting Singapore.,,
,,"Stunning, 100% would recommend",5,,"The Gardens by the Bay were so so beautiful. Couldn't get enough of the stunning surroundings, and the views of the city around us were fantastic (they provided some fantastic photo opportunities)!! We went at about 5pm which was perfect timing as we saw the gardens in the daylight, but then also got to watch the night show where all the giant trees lit up!",,
,,Beautiful!,5,,The flower dome and cloud forest take you to a different world. The super tree light show at 7:45 in the evening was a surprise and it was spectacular.,,
,,A Must Visit @ Night,5,,"I think the best view really is at night. At day, Gardens by the Bay just like another artificial garden that looks a bit dull. Once the sun is set, that you will be mesmerized by the wonderful architecture of lightning this garden has.",,
,,Excellent exhibits/gardens - a must do in Singapore,5,,"Gardens by the Bay...superb way to spend time in Singapore. The two domes; cloud forest and flower dome are both laid out brilliantly and offer respite from the outdoor temp and humidity.
Flower dome exhibits reminded us of Chelsea Flower Show...beautiful blooms everywhere. The cloud forest walk through ...brilliant.
We watched the evening light/music show from ground level - was great!
Beware you'll need to queue for heading up to the walkway and need to give enough time if that's where you want to be...
Highly recommended if you're in Singapore.",,
,,Overhyped!,2,,I could have saved both time and money by not going to the domes which was boring for both the kids and me. The waterfall in cloud dome is far too small to inspire awe. The only saving grace was the super trees and the absolutely awesome light and sound show there at night.,,
,,A PLACE TO ESCAPE THE CITY,4,,"The Gardens by the bay is supposed to be a peek at the Singapore of the future as a city in a park. It comes close.

The park if you hit it at the right time, early mornings for one, is almost sleepy and peaceful. I saw a very large lizard slowly cross the wide sidewalk in no hurry.

If you take the time walks down many of the paths revel interesting sights. On the way to the trees there are many windowed displays containing rocks and other natural objects in a picture setting. Do these before the flower domes. You will enjoy them more and that way the park builds it's appeal.

If you hit it right there are shuttles at the MRT stops to make the start easy.",,
,,Wrong signboard,1,,Some navigation signboards inside garden are installed in wrong direction. It is misleading. Actually it is installed but didn鈥檛 rotated correctly. Please see attached Signboard photo and rotate it.,,
,,Food,5,,Excellent food. The staff was very helpful. Good varieties. Will come again. The ambience was also good,,
,,Exotic plant life,4,,"Well worth the experience. Tree species you will never see north of the equator the same goes for flowers and shrubs unless you have a similar conservatory. This is all in the huge consevatories we didn鈥檛 have time for the rest of the gardens.
A gardeners paradise. Well worth the visit",,
,,Trourist Attraction,4,,"dubai and singapore are inventing ways to attract tourists and this is one of them . It is a good place and there is a laser show in the evening which lacks imagination , not one the good ones .
The over all place is good to pass time for few hours",,
,,Amazing Place... lots of time required,5,,"Step into another time and place when you visit the Gardens by the Bay.

Keep a very close eye out for the scultures watching your every move. Very well thought out walking trail that lets you see everything, if you have the time and the ""eye"" for it. It also keeps the people moving.

Temperature and humidity make this a great place to hide from the outside world.

So many things to see and so few hours in a day. You might even have to come back again.

The fantasy creatures keep the kids looking and enthralled. Make sure your camera is fully charged before you go.

Let's not forget the amazing array of plants and flowers that pop up around every turn and twist.

Exceptional value.

Great big thanks to the wonderful crew behind the scenes. Front of house staff were brilliant and smiling making this visit so wonderful.

Definitely need to visit this place when you are in town.",,
,,Breathtaking!,5,,"This is such a special place. We enjoyed the beautiful grounds, and paid the $8 to go up and walk the bridge. A must see!",,
,,Nice n smooth,5,,It was just a family outing. Did not know where to go but end up here. It was nice. My family enjoyed it. A place where u take a gazillion pics!,,
,,A walk to remember,5,,"What a magnificient destination to visit, especially in the night when the lightning is up! I visited Garden by The Bay with my family (elderly and kids) and we really enjoyed the leisure walk in the garden, discovering so many species of plants that we have never seen before.

An educational and breathtaking journey. Strongly recommend to visit this destination if you have a night to spare. Plus it is fairly near to MBS which will be a great opportunity to take some memorable photos under the skyline of the Lion City!",,
,,Nothing quite like it,5,,This is a must visit if you like Gardens. Very extraordinary and breathtakingly. Remember to bring a jacket or sweater as it can be cold inside.,,
,,An Absolute Joy!,5,,"An unexpected joy! We began with the trolly ride around the Gardens, which was well worthwhile and put all the areas in context. It is a large complex, the weather hot and the commentary was very interesting. All the gardens are well, cared for and planted with imagination and flair. The sculptures were many and varied throughout the gardens. We visited Cloud Dome and The Flower Dome ...again beautifully created and well worth seeing. Don鈥檛 miss any of this!",,
,,Choose the aircon gardens,4,,"We were happy with the selection inside the gardens, well maintained and beautiful. It was good choice to spend minimum half day at the garden. What a good stress release",,
,,Spectacular,5,,Worth a visit . We went late afternoon and carried on into the evening to see the light show . Greatly done and you will enjoy it,,
,,Nothing else quite like it,5,,"We were tourists and with the help of the very friendly local people we managed to get there by train had to change trains ones and that was an experience in its self.
The gardens are free to enter but because the area is so large there is a buggy for the cost of $3 will take you to where the towers are which have the light show every night.
Best to go at twilight and the show starts about 8 o鈥檆lock....absolutely fantastic",,
,,The Supergrove Trees are so COOL!,5,,"I recommend going to this spot at night. It's not too far from Marina Bay where the evening laser light fountain show can be found. Also, in the evening, the supergrove trees light up at night and it's very beautiful!",,
,,lovely place to visit,5,,"A must visit attraction in Singapore, especially the Cloud forest and Flower dome. The Garden Rhapsody at the Supertree Grove is beautiful too. Also, amazing food at Satay by the bay. (one of the best satays in Singapore)",,
,,Scenic View from Super Tree,5,,"Lots of different species of flowers in the Flower Dome, its Chinese New Year theme now. There is a mini Cherry Blossom tree,too!
In the Cloud Garden an amazingly tall waterall greets you as you enter. Plenty of Orchids and the walk is slightly different. Take a lift to the top floor and stroll via the open skywalk bridge. A little challenge for those afraid of heights.
The view from the Super Tree open deck is nice. Windy though!
If you love walking, this is the place.
Wear good walking shoes as the outside garden is free and its a huge park! There are herb garden, sculptures, lakes, boardwalk...
2 ways to go. Exit Marina Bay Sand to river side, take a straight walk down.
By mrt, follow the sign to Gardens by the Bay but dont go all the way. There is a short escalator which you will pass, take that to go main road. Then turn right after exit and walk few meters to take lift to 6th floor. Walk through glass door entrance and it takes you to the link bridge. Quite a distance to walk.
For older folks you might want to consider taking a few dollar tram ride to entrance of Flower Dome.",,
,,HUGE PARK,5,,We visited the flower dome and the other ones were with waterfall(forget what its called) it was very beautiful! The dome is so hugeeee and breathtaking! We bring our suitcase everywhere coz we only stayed for a day in sg they have coin locker available! So beautiful!,,
,,Morning Walk,5,,Great way to pass a few hours. Gardens by the Bay are beautifully designed and are well worth a visit.,,
,,Love the Flower Dome,5,,"I and my gf had annual tickets to visit the Flower Dome ... We would regularly cycle along East Coast Park, over Marina Barrage and into Gardens by the Bay. We would spend about 30 mins in the Flower Dome admiring the beautiful flowers and sitting and reading in the delightful surroundings.

One recommendation I would have is for more seating so that people can sit, pause and relax to admire the beautiful surroundings.",,
,,Wonderful Experience,5,,Loved everything about this garden. Go in December-January not so hot. Very impressive. IF you go during September - there are add on displays to celebrate the Lantern festival.,,
,,A must visit place,5,,Went for a walk around the cloud forest and it is absolutely stunning. Need a bit of a head for heights as you get to go to the very top of the dome. Fascinating place and well worth the $18 to visit,,
,,Nice,4,,I`m not actually very plant knowing person but still gardens are very nice place to go. Can be very over crowded at times. Unfortunatley could not get to the Sky Walk because of thunderstorm and heavy rain. Recommended to visit when in Singapore.,,
,,After third time...,3,,"This time accompanied a friend who was the first timer. He said good things about the garden, I was getting bored about what I saw (several times).
It was a late noon after a short raining and I got tired after a long walk that day.
It should be relaxing afternoon in Gardens by the Bay, but too bad I did not feel excited anymore.",,
,,Brilliant Displays!,4,,"Great place for a date! Lovely flowers, awesomely cool cloud forest and amazing supertrees! Would love to visit more floral displays!",,
,,Very nice way to spend 1/2 day,4,,It really is a very impressive gardens. I got there for opening time 8am on a sat. The crowds were not very big and it was quite comfortable walking around the park and the 2 Greenhouses,,
,,Great half day excursion,4,,"Having seen the Gardens illuminated at night time from the Marina Bay rooftop, we decided that we must see them durning the day. So having half a day to kill before getting our flight we jumped in a cab and spent a wonderful afternoon exploring the vairous gardens. Whilst not a huge gardener myself, I was pleasantly surprised how much there was to see and do. You cannot help but enjoy the experiece, as the glass houses are stunning and fun to explore. The treetop walk is also good fun with some great views over the bay area and the Marian Bay Hotel as an iconic backdrop.

It was hot and humid and wished we had better walking shoes, as there is a lot of walking to be done. Definatley worth a visit for garden enthusiasts and general brousers alike and then head for the marina for a cool beer.",,
,,Beautiful Flower Dome,5,,It was a great experience seeing different beautiful flowers. And very good place to take beautiful pictures.,,
,,Ultimate destination,5,,"Wow! What a place! Don't ever miss this destination. It is a must see place in your Singapore itinerary
The way it is done amazing. Just to see the 2 gardens you need half day and if you want to go around the Gardens by the bay (it is 250 Acres) you will need one full day. Great!",,
,,Amazing visual experience,5,,"A beautiful way to spend an afternoon in Singapore. The waterfalls, flower gardens, Indochine restaurant on top of the largest tower all amazing",,
,,A must to do,5,,"This was a wonderful place to visit. One to add to your list to do in Singapore. Entering the domes that are full of flowers, plants and sculptures can be a lovely relief from the heat as these are all airconditioned. Take your time wandering as there's much to take in. The cloud dome has a great indoor walk way that sweeps around inside and gives you some pretty awesome views. We went during the day so haven't yet had a chance to see the structures they have around the area light up at night yet but that is still on the cards.
You can purchase tickets there with no hassle.",,
,,Almost lseems like Paradise on Earth @Singapore,5,,"Flowers Flowers and more flowers -this attaction is my Mothers most favourite ,Kids adore GBB too
Just too much walking for senior citizens -also Cloud Mountain lift system need to improve its not kids ( in stroller) and seniors friendly . Buggys standing outside but refuse to ferry seniors and kids to Satay by the bay after we exit the dome /cloud mountain -its painful to walk for dinner after 9 pm when all other eateries closed -food at satay by the bay excellent especially the turkish food .",,
,,Excellent Environment to Visit,5,,My family and I enjoyed the views in Cloud forest and flower dome. It was nice and relaxing experience.,,
,,Lovely gardens.,5,,Gardens are beautifully laid out and free to walk round. There is a charge for some of the attractions. Free light show in the evening is worth a visit.,,
,,Favourite local destination,5,,"I鈥檓 a local and this garden is a cool convenient place for weekends with friends or solo. It鈥檚 nice, cool and every quarterly you get new flowers and theme. Gardens outside is hot but still a nice walk. Try it. But beware of the humidity and heat. Bring water as anything is costly there.",,
,,Great place to just stroll around and spend a day,4,,"These gardens are nice and it is interesting but it wasn't as ""awesome"" as I had been led to believe. You get some great photos and the place has a nice vibe about it but I was expecting something a little more. It would have been great if they had allowed some birds or insects native to the area into the dome to give it a little more realism and serenity.
Overall a good activity but wouldn't be in my top 5",,
,,Great place for a morning walk/jog,4,,"Not sure the idea of a daytime walk around the gardens in the Singapore heat would be a starter for me but as an early morning exercise seperate it鈥檚 great.

Lots of tracks and excellent gardens, this is well presented and kept.
Did note there were a number of restaurants and bars available too",,
,,A must visit...,5,,A great space in Singapore... breathtaking plants and an aerial walkway for views across the city to Marina Bay Hotel,,
,,A must see,5,,"If you are in Singapore, don't miss this; at night, it literally feels like you're on a different planet, like Avatar in real life.",,
,,Amazing place,4,,"We took MRT out and walked around the shopping area and then to the Gardens by the Bay.
It is absolutely beautiful and so much to look at without even going into the paid exhibitions.
There are quiet a few choices for eating but we particularly liked Satay by the Bay, it is right at the end but worth the walk as you can take a different path back. It is similar to a food court with a very good range of well priced food.
The detail in the plant arrangements is excellent and we were lucky enough to see some Otters lying around near the water.",,
,,Great for a walk or rest,5,,"This place is not just a park.

It鈥檚 a place to relax, walk around, see new things, animals, greenery but also a place to gather with friends

Even though it鈥檚 a touristic place you will still be able to find a quiet place to rest, picnic or read a book.

Have fun!",,
,,Beautiful sightseeing place!,5,,"One of the most beautiful sightseeing place that I have ever seen. It is super easy to visit the Garden by the Bay solo because of the excellent directions, paths and maps. This is a must do in Singapore!",,
,,Only in Singapore,5,,"Stunning gardens and massive glass houses with a skyway amongst the super tree grove giving incredible views of the Gardens, Harbour and Marina Bay Sands. There is a cost for some of the attractions in these Gardens, $28 for the Cloud and Flower glass house and $8 for the Skyway. The shuttle that runs from the entrance to the glass house is $3 unlimited trips. There is also an audio shuttle and a self drive one which we didn't do but would next time as this goes around the whole garden. The flower house and cloud are amazing houses with no expense spared giving wonderful visual displays of the most amazing colour. And a welcome relief from the heat outside as they are quite cooler than I would have thought. The cloud with its 6 storey waterfall where you take the lift to the top to begin your descend amongst the walkways. The gardens are absolutely a must visit. If you love your gardens, be amazed and you can spends hours here. If you are in a hurry and only have a half day do the paid attractions, Cloud and Flower house you won't be disappointed.",,
,,A garden city,5,,"On of the most iconic place in Singapore. Just across Marina Bay Sand Hotel, at MRT CC3 station. You can visit the breathtaking super tree and also have various choices of foods in the garden. The garden of the children is also an attractive to young kids. Must b here!",,
,,A must see if you like plants!,5,,"An amazing accomplishment. The Disneyland of plants, worth the cost to see the indoor gardens. Nightly light show should not be missed, and its free!",,
,,Disneyland for Plants,5,,Impressive even for those not into plants or gardens. Can spend the whole day exploring and discovering. Would highly recommend.,,
,,New Years Light Show,5,,Definitely a must see and the crowd vibe was happy despite the wet weather. Recommend you lie down to look up or you'll get a crick in your neck.,,
,,unique,5,,We had heard about the gardens from other travellers. Our visit certainly confirmed it was well worth the time. Amazing. Well thought out by those who designed it so visitors could move around without feeling 'crowded in'. certainly will return next time we have a stopover in Singapore.,,
,,Christmas,5,,This is a must do when in Singapore. Day or night it is graat. So much work and thought put into this.,,
,,Stunning,5,,"An amazing all-day visit. You can do this on your own, because they have so much information, but a guide will add so much more information and insight.",,
,,One of the best places botanical gardens in the world!,5,,"This place is by far a marvel of engineering as it is a place to see exotic flora. By artificially controlling the indoor temperature and humidity, they have created an marvel that brings the beauty of temperate countries to tropical Singapore. It is a must visit!",,
,,Magical Place,5,,"This place is magical, seems like a scene from Avatar. It is even prettier when seen from the Sky Park on the top of Marina Bay Sands.",,
,,Relaxing place,4,,It鈥檚 a must see when you are in Singapore! Both the cloud and rainforest was a awesome! You need to give yourself about 3 hours for both gardens! So many flowers and plants that can grow under this condition is amazing!,,
,,Must see,5,,"This is a must see Don't go if the weather looks bad , they won't let you up Fantastic views Not really expensive , planty of places to get something to eat Erick ect",,
,,fantastic,5,,"you have to see this place its amazing a real Credit to the people who built and and care for it, easy to get around and very enjoyable for all ages",,
,,Flower everywhere,5,,"Educated and interested place in Singapore, you can learning while having fun in here, and also there many best spot to take a picture.",,
,,"Gardens by the Bay and ""Planet""",5,,"Gardens by the Bay is located near the Marina Bay Sands complex in Singapore. You can walk around the grounds and around the Super Trees at no cost. There is a charge for the Cloud Forest, displaying tropical plant life, and the Flower Dome, housing many plants and flowers and is the largest greenhouse in the world. The three waterfront gardens include Bay South, Bay East, and Bay Central. There is also a children鈥檚 garden and the super tree grove. An Outdoor Gardens Tour is available for $5 adults and $3 children. Unfortunately for us, we had just missed the last tour of the day. We walked through some of the gardens and by the pretty Dragon Fly Lake. At night, lights and music transform the Supertrees into a fantastic extravaganza of color. This Garden Rhapsody is done twice every evening. We were there for the early show and it was filled with people who had 鈥渟taked out鈥?the best viewing spots. This show is free and I highly recommend going to one of the shows to enjoy the lights and music.
One of the most unique sculptures in the Gardens of the Bay is called 鈥淧lanet鈥? Planet is a white-painted baby that is more than 29 feet long and nearly 10 feet tall. It was done by a British artist named Marc Quinn. It looks like the baby is floating but in actuality one of its hands is resting on the ground. Amazing sculpture!",,
,,Superb place,5,,"A must visit if you are in Singapore.
Buy your tickets eight at the airport once u land as they give u better and cheap deals than the city.
Spend good 2-3 hours in this place.
Its just beautiful.
Very well managed property ,beautifully decorated, cleanliness is maintained really well.
A few pictures have been tagged for all of u ....
The flower dome &cloud forest is a must visit when ur here .
This place is situated at the bayfront .
Marina bay sands.",,
,,Forest in the clouds,4,,"Second habitat I鈥檝e visited. Like the location, other habitat is also good but probably better to have two visits. Love the flower trees. Singapore flyer shows good views.",,
,,Couldn't believe it's Free!,5,,"Not so easy to find the way in especially if you are entering from the Marina Bay Sands hotel, you need to go up to find the bridge walkway, we had to ask.

I couldn't believe that this was all free, you only have to pay to use the upper walkway but it was closing as we arrived due to a lightening warning! Take your umbrella it rained for most of our visit.

There are so many different areas so make sure you wear decent shoes, plus there is a kind of water park for young children. We had coffee in McDonald's in the gardens but only because you'll find free wifi there .

At night there are timed light shows you can probably find the times online but we had a flight to catch.",,
,,Impressive,4,,Great musics complex of the 3 main cultures of Singapore. Impressive light show . Worth your time and it鈥檚 free!,,
,,Stunning!,5,,"Me and my husband went to see it on a stop over flight to Bangkok.
The place is absolutely stunning and the views breathtaking.
Everything is spotless, completely symmetrical and thouroghly looked after. I wish I had more time to spend here but I had to catch the connecting flight. Don't miss it if you go to Singapore!",,
,,Beautiful,5,,We spent a lot of hours at the gardens. It鈥檚 so beautiful walking around and checking all that beauty! Our favorite part was the cloud forest and the waterfalls!!! It was an oasis,,
,,Amazing,5,,"Absolutely incredible experience - a futuristic feel, like being in the movie about the future. If you like all things green, this is the place. The gardens also have an educational function, with many exhibits explaining the depletion humans are putting down on Earth, and really ask people to do better.
The overall design and quality and awe-inspiring.
A must visit in Singapore.",,
,,Beautiful views,4,,Beautiful views of nearby attractions. May require walking especially to get to Sands. Nice gift shop.,,
,,Lovely place to visit,5,,"If you're in Singapore for more than 24 hours then go and visit Gardens by the Bay. A beautiful place, easily reached and with easy access for all. Access is free though there are small charges to enter the domestic and walk on the Skyway",,
,,Interesting learning experience,5,,"We visited with Japanese guests and even though we had been there before, it was still a good experience that we enjoyed a lot. There are lots of different kinds of plants that all come with descriptions of where they come from, what conditions they need to grow and others like that. The two domes are air-conditioned and so helps with the sweltering heat.",,
,,Futuristic experience,5,,"The outside park is amazing and you can easily spend 2-3 hours only there. But the most wow experience we got was in the domes, my favourite was the cloud forest. I can recommend to take the elevator up to sands skypark to get an another view of the park too.",,
,,a beautiful place,5,,"me and friends went to this beautiful place by 5 pm we saw the sunset and this place was very great, very beautiful and eith a breath taking view. this place is a highly recommended place to visit.",,
,,Spectacular,5,,"It takes 3 hours to walk through the domes which are terrific , get a seat early for the light show.",,
,,Swell of a good time!,5,,"On our second trip to Singapore, we intentionally avoided Sentosa and focused on the Marina Bay Sands area. Glad that this attraction is largely free. Lovely to see the blooms and foliage in the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest but I wouldn鈥檛 really want to spend for this when my kids only would rather run in wide open spaces.

Next time? With kids - I鈥檇 skip the domes and just let them cool off at the Children鈥檚 Garden again... and again... and again.",,
,,Whole Complex Is Great,5,,"There are 2 domes and the Super Trees, including a sky walk which has separate pricing. You can comfortably spend a couple of hours here and take your time. Easily accessible from Marina Bay Sands complex or MRT. We visited twice as the Domes were closing for maintenance (mid January 2018) so we wanted to see both and went during the day. We came back at night to witness the colours of it all lit up and also do the skywalk. Excellent place.",,
,,Breathtakingly Green,5,,"If only people could, like the myriad of green things, be together and live as healthily and happily side by side in an environment that nurtures and protects. We could almost sense the plants singing and chattering in these 2 architecturally stunning, light-filled glass structures. Who wouldn't be enchanted and feel joy by wandering through winding pathways surrounded by everything imaginable from tiny organic plants to cacti to over-arching trees, all basking in the light and living happily together. Unforgettable, and unmissable.",,
,,Worth a visit,5,,"This attraction is a must if you are staying in Singapore. We went to this attraction twice, once in the evening for the light show (Garden Rhapsody) at the Supertrees. We wanted to do the OCBC Skyway walk, but they stopped selling tickets due to the number of people, so we watched from below. I really enjoyed the light show and felt it was an amazing experience. The second time we went was in the morning. We arrived about 10am and did not have to queue for tickets or entrance to the OCBC Skyway walk. It is not much of a walk, but you get a good view and it was only $8 each. If you do not like heights I would not recommend this walk, as the path wobbled at times and you felt like you should hold on.

We then went to the Flower Dome, which was very good and colourful. Lots of different themes within the Dome from Chinese to Mediterranean. It is worth a visit, but we must preferred the Cloud Forest. The Cloud Forest was so cool. You enter by the huge waterfall and then make your way around including taking the lift to the walk above and around the waterfall.

We then walked around the park and enjoyed the lakes, flowers and trees. I would go in the morning as it started to get very busy and hot.",,
,,We came to Singapore to get engaged,5,,The Gardens by the Bay are completely magical. The scale and beauty simply takes your breath away. After seeing the Sky Gardens on the TV i was in love and decided this was the perfect place to pop the question. The place is just magical and is even more beautiful at night.,,
,,"outstanding, beautiful",5,,"Cloud garden and flower garden are a must, big domes one with varying types of flowers, shrubs displayed in an unusual way. Cloud dome was massive, large mountain style garden with sky high walkways, waterfall and the most beautiful plants. so very enjoyable for all the family.",,
,,"Super cool, super large!!!",5,,Been 15 years since last in Singapore but what a fantastic additional the city have now with Gardens by the Bay. Extremely impressive in size but also in details. Visit the 鈥渃louds鈥?involves a lift ride which was a little bottleneck on mid Saturday. But worth the waiting! Go there!!,,
,,Stunning,5,,"Spent five days in Singapore & visited Gardens by the Bay several times . Was Stunning - loved it !
The light show was beautiful & the gardens were beautifully kept . Several places to eat there & lovely just to either sit or wonder around .",,
,,Magnificent gardens a must see in Singapore,5,,"You must go to the marina Bay Area to see this compilation of attractions that showcase gardens and plants and the environment.
There are three main parts to this attraction. Gardens of the world, a mountain garden exhibition with a massive interior waterfall and a skywalk above the tree level.
All three can be seen individually or collectively.
I was most impressed with the use of statuary and displays to augment the feel of each section of the gardens.
A must see for all ages.",,
,,Make sure you take this sight in..,5,,Interesting place with the Cloud Forest and a Flower Garden well worth a look. The towers are fascinating and the walk across the bridge gives fantastic views of Singapore.,,
,,Amazing,4,,It鈥檚 a very good place to have a great view of Marina Bay Sand. You can have beautiful shots when you鈥檙e up there on those super trees.,,
,,Free attraction,5,,"The bay gardens are a lovely place to visit and explore. It is free and well worth a visit. If you want to visit the cloud dome, flower conservatory or aerial walkway there is a charge. But the main gardens have plenty to see.",,
,,amazing gardens,5,,There are very interesting plants and the waterfall is nice and cool. It is good for family with children.,,
,,"Garden, Architectural and Art Lovers Wonderland",5,,"Although we did this across 3 generational age groups the vast grounds were a delight to walk. Once the middle of the day temps reached about 31 and 89% the flower dome and cloud forest, zen and were brilliant climate controlled viewing, and a meandering delight to behold. Lots of inspiration and beauty as you catch some respite from the tropical outdoors.",,
,,Good Places,4,,It's a good places for end your trip the day in the night. A lot of colorful lights decorate every place. You can take a nice picture here with the best background,,
,,Place to Visit,5,,Dont miss Flower dome and cloud Forest a must see well maintained and organized Light show at 7.45 & 8.45 PM was very good,,
,,One of the highlights of our trip...must do,5,,My only regret is we couldn't spend more time here. We were in Singapore for only 2 days and we wanted to see and experience most of what it had to offer. The gardens are truly amazing and you can easily spend 4 hours here and not enjoy it fully. A must see is the night light show which is free.,,
,,Plants,2,,"Nice place to fill in some time, I visited on a cool day. I have heard it is unbearable in the heat. Could improve bathroom facilities and eating options. These were disappointing.",,
,,Really special place,5,,Beautifully done and so informative. If you don't want to go into the domes you can just walk around which we never knew before paying a lot to go in. But it was lovely. Great views.,,
,,Really with seeing,5,,"A wonderful experience, despite the heat, especially the Cloud Forest with the secret garden & waterfall.

The Flower Done is nice but not as spectacular. The gardens are beautiful with wonderful walkways, views & fountains. Thoroughly recommend going. The light show is also incredible so you need to visit both daytime & nighttime but if you have a garden view room @ The Marina Bay Sands, you can watch from your balcony. There is also a walkway through from a special life outside the hotel. Very well organised but it gets busy & you need a hat!",,
,,Beautiful and refreshingly cool,5,,This is a must if you go to Singapore. The flower gardens are well laid out with interesting and exciting displays. Many of the flowers are normally from cooler parts of the world so I felt quite at home there!,,
,,Garden,5,,Excellent place to go for. Kids are very happy. So many interesting things to see. Waterfall was awesome. Lost garden is the best. Also was a secret garden. Must see,,
,,Well in line with 'Amazing Asia',5,,"Lengthy description unnecessary. If you've come this far in your search for things to do in Singapore, then you'll obviously be going. Hint: Go mid- to late-afternoon, stay for the nightly light display, then go eat at Satays by the Bay (open-air) to round off your experience.",,
,,Must visit between 7 pm to 9 pm,5,,Excellent music and light show in the late evening time between 7 pm to 9 pm. OCBC skywalk around that time is great treat to eyes and ear.,,
,,Very pretty gardens,4,,"I didn't visit any of the domes, but the free gardens are definitely worth the visit by itself. Very nice places to sit around or walk.",,
,,Loved it,5,,Just get prepared to spend around 3 hours wondering around it! I suggest going in the late afternnon so that you can also enjoy the evening show at the tree grove and walk accross to Marina sands and watch the other light water show!,,
,,A great gardens day out,4,,"Visited Gardens by the Bay in January 2018. We stayed at the Mandarin Oriental so really close by for us.

Sign on street said 760 mtrs but points you towards the river. Actually you go through the Marina Bay Sands hotel and on to a walkway that takes you to gardens. Was a really hot day so the two biospheres were a welcome cool down.

High level walkway is great but smaller than we thought. A really nice day out and well worth a visit.",,
,,Beautiful visit,4,,"Gardens by the Bay is an artificially set-up garden with beautiful landscaping . We went there during sunset and the view was magical. Very well kept and maintained. The treetop bar has amazing view (but so do a lot of places in Singapore). Entry into the domes were priced high, and we did not buy tickets. But I have heard that they are quite enjoyable too.

The sound and light show after it got dark was worth the visit.",,
,,Must come!,5,,it must be on your top itinerary if you come to singapore. good price and family friendly. bring your kid and eldery was okay because they provide good access and lift if you want see the top.,,
,,Understandably a top attraction in Singapore,5,,"We made the effort to get there at a reasonable time in the morning, before visitor crowds built up.

It鈥檚 worth remembering, if you have travelled by Singapore Air, to keep your boarding cards. These will give a 10% discount at a number of places in Singapore, including Gardens by the Bay.

We took advantage of the $3 shuttle from the entrance near the Bay Front MRT station which took us up to the main site (this avoids a 10 鈥?15 minute walk) and set off first for the skywalk (which is a separate charge because access is weather dependent). This was relatively quiet at that time and we were able to linger and enjoy the views from the amazing structures.

After exploring some of the exterior gardens we set off for the domes. These are impressive structures 鈥?Cloud Forest (the larger dome) is fascinating and contained in what is claimed to be the largest glasshouse in the world. My wife preferred that dome, I preferred the Flower dome 鈥?that is a matter of taste.

To see these domes properly takes time and we split the visits with lunch at a nearby food court area 鈥?Satay by the Sea 鈥?which is on the edge of the main site, a 10 minute walk from the Domes.

Ideally (not being quite as young and active as in the past) we would have liked to spread the visit over 2 days, but the ticket only allows for a visit to each Dome on the day of purchase. By the end of the second dome, after lunch we were too tired to contemplate hanging around for the evening lights show. Younger folk may not have that problem. Anyway, by the time we left the site, crowds were building up and the more relaxed atmosphere we had enjoyed earlier in the day had changed, so we were glad to get away.

This is a hugely successful development in Singapore and we are delighted to have had the opportunity to visit. It is not a replacement for the wonderful botanic gardens, which are still our favourite gardens in all cities we have visited, but these are worth seeing in their own right.",,
,,Beauty Gardens and Well maintain.,5,,I love the way they created indoor garden with many difference plants around the world to grow in the same place. Absolutely beautiful and very impressive.,,
,,Man made wonder. Must visit for something different.,4,,"I loved gardens by the bay. Wonderful man made ambience apt for rainforests. All climatic conditions are modified for complete development for flora and fauna found in rainforests and mountains.

I even saw insect eating plants which I had only heard about in schools.
Misty. Calm. Serene. BEAUTIFUL !",,
,,Great visit,5,,We ensured we took a whole day to do the Gardens....... even managed to walk the sky way through the trees - had to hold on though as not happy with the way it wobbles and bounces. Be aware that if the weather isn't good you cannot use this attraction. The cloud dome is amazing and even with the height it feels safe and offers fabulous views of the waterfall and vertical planting on the cliff. The flower dome was colourful and the focus until March is on Dahlias.,,
,,Fascinating,5,,"Both Cloud and Flower Domes were amazing, enjoyed the area, wasn't able to walk outside due to limited time. Suggested time would be 5-6hours. And check first if Domes are close before going.",,
,,Must See,5,,Don't want to say too much as it will spoil it but must go here! Shame the light show was called off due to technical problems. Great for all ages and accessibility is great.,,
,,Impressive,5,,"This large complex features two huge glass domes, one of them the largest greenhouse in the world, as well as extensive outdoor gardens. In the domes are a huge waterfall built around a tower that you can walk around, and in the other there are vast displays of Mediterranean climate vegetation. Outside are various themed gardens as well as huge ""supertrees"", artificial trees that capture rainwater and collect solar energy. The Skywalk allows you to walk between some of these super trees and gain a fine view over the park. This is an impressive park and well worth a visit.",,
,,Sheer18,5,,We had a wonderful time in Singapore we went here and it鈥檚 just beautiful ..clean and beautiful gardens鉂わ笍鉂わ笍,,
,,Interesting if you like plants,3,,It was a bit crowded and your quickly get planted out. Cool inside but a hot walk to get there. Not cheap,,
,,Amazing,5,,Gardens by the Bay is a must see. The garden dome and cloud dome are spectacular. Make sure you are there when the misting is done in the cloud dome it looks amazing.,,
,,Awesome,5,,It was amazing experience in Flower Dome & Cloud forest one should not miss if in Singapore. Probably the most beautiful indoor attraction you may ever find on Globe.,,
,,Awesome,4,,"Must see. Don鈥檛 miss the show in the evening. Get the timings correct before headed there, try the evening as the weather is better.",,
,,Amazingg!,5,,I am soooo blessed and amazed in the Garden by the Bay...coz i can see n touch many plants n flowers that i only dreamt for all this time...i wanna go there again sometime with all of my family member 馃槝鉂?,,
,,Magical,5,,Was there for Christmas and must say one of the most beautiful and well kept places I鈥檝e ever been. Looks better at night especially if you tour up to the walkway and have the backdrop of marina bay behind you.,,
,,Well worth visiting,4,,"Visited both conservatories, well worth the visit. Unfortunately rained during our visit so not able to explore outside, visited the 'treetop' bar, which had amazing views!",,
,,Never Seen So Many Plants,4,,"I have no real interest in all things garden, but our party wanted to go there and I have to say I was surprised how much I enjoyed the visit. There is so much to that you can't get board and when you clime to the top of the gardens the view is great.",,
,,Absolutely stunning park!,5,,You can spend hours here exploring different areas of the park appreciating the efforts that have been put into making this such a great cultural attraction. Highly recommended!,,
,,Great place and ambience!,5,,We went for this place to see the gardens and we were so amaze by the place because it was cold and very comforting.,,
,,Must see attraction.,5,,"Beautiful gardens, easy access, great light show every evening at 7.45 pm and 8.45 pm in the Super Grove. Plenty of room for everyone and can be seen easily from various points in the park. Immaculate and impressive surroundings. There are cafes dotted throughout the gardens and a shuttle bus running through the gardens to various attractions (I think there is a small change of 3S$ for unlimited use.) Well worth visiting.",,
,,The most beautiful place I have ever visited,5,,"We were all looking forward to our visit to ""The gardens by the bay"" but wow were we impressed. What a spectacular sight this is. If you have a bucket list this place must go on it. We booked online because we didn't want to turn up and not be allowed in. Apparently some days it can be very busy. There is so much to see you could spend a couple of days there. We went into two large domes, one called the ""Flower dome"" which contained plants from all over the world and a special dahlia display. The design of this place is spectacular, there is so much colour and it's not too warm inside it her. Perfect for having a long walk around. We then visited the ""Cloud forest"". This place is just like its name. On entering you will see a beautiful waterfall falling from the clouds. Lots of mosses, orchids of every colour and cacti surround you and there are many levels with spectacular views from every one. Very easy to get around due to ramps, lifts etc. They have thought of everything. We didn't want to leave but as we were on in Singapore for two days we had to make the most of our time. When we came outside we had a drink from one of the many eateries around the whole area. We then wandered around the gardens which are mesmerising. The ""supertrees"" are enormous and unbelievably big. We paid an extra 8 dollars to go up to the OCBC skyway which is a bridge between the super trees. It is well worth it because you don't just see the gardens from here you can see all over Marina Bay and beyond. This place is definitely worth many repeat visits and we can't wait to go back.",,
,,Wonderful,5,,The gardens by the bay are a must while visiting Singapore. An excellent attraction with no entry fee. If you are in Singapore you must go.,,
,,Beautiful place,5,,This is a must visit while in Singapore. Possibly the most beautiful indoor plant houses in the world,,
,,So beautiful garden~,5,,I have very special experienence in skywalk on the top of the sky roof garden.they closed if the weather is bad.,,
,,Beautiful,5,,Just walking around looking at the atmosphere at night was amazing. It was both relaxing and exciting. The lights lit up beautifully and everything was beautiful.,,
,,Beautiful Garden,5,,"Go see it. Bring umbrella & sunscreen. Loads of flora, birds, flowers and statuary. Didn鈥檛 try the food. Gift shop is huge.",,
,,RichardB,5,,"This is a fantastic attraction. Like the rest of Singapore it's immaculately maintained and the imaginative giant trees, artificial mountains, waterfalls and walkways are really exciting and impressive. Educational too in a really fun way Well done!",,
,,Paradise,5,,Well I have seen the pictures of this fantastic place. But photos do not do the park justice. The two domes are a real treat with the Cloud sphere some something special. You are taken buy lift to the mountain top and using walkways. Simply fantastic. One of the wonders of the world. All for $28 Sing. The park is free and offers a great experience of gardens from around the world. However the highlight was the evening laser show of the world famous super trees. Magnificent. During the day you can walk on a suspended walkway offering great views of the city. A must for all visitors. One of the best places I have ever visited.,,
,,Amazing collection of incredible giant bonsai trees with modern sculptures,5,,"I was amazed with the combination of giant bonsai type trees, juxtaposed with huge sky scraping tree structures. This is tastefully constructed and become more beautiful as each year the growth encapsulates the beholder. Amazing!",,
,,Great few from the roof top bar at The Big Tree restaurant by Indochine,5,,"Good ambient, perfect to visit from 6.30pm so u get to see day and night. Great light show and its free!! Nice roof top bar n good spot for photo taking. Indochine food is great.",,
,,Paradise on earth,5,,"Called one of the top ten indoor gardens in the world, this is one of those attractions that my husband and I were especially keen on visiting, because the last time we visited Singapore, it didn鈥檛 exist.

Stretching out (as the name suggests) along the bay, Gardens by the Bay has some very futuristic looking towers covered with greenery, soaring up into the sky. As you walk along tree-lined paths, it鈥檚 all very pleasant鈥攂ut the fun starts inside.

Having bought our tickets (S$28 per adult, S$15 for the child), which allow entry to the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest, we went first into the Flower Dome, which is a huge conservatory spread over several levels, with nine gardens from across five continents spread out inside. From an olive grove to a stand of Canary Island date palms, to conifers that form a sweet backdrop to a Christmas scene (we went in early January, and the Yuletide decorations were still around), this is perfectly landscaped. There are flowers all round (I especially went nuts over the fuchsias, which are exquisite) and, dotting the area, large sculptures made of what looked like wood pulp, of birds, animals, even dragons鈥攙ery nice.

Next up is the Cloud Forest, which is a representation of a rainforest, inside another huge dome. When you enter, the first thing that strikes you is the 35 mt tall waterfall. This is fun, but even more fascinating and informative is the forest itself. For this, we had to go up in an elevator right to the top of the 鈥楥loud Walk鈥? from where you start wending your way downwards. At each level, you walk for some distance on a suspended walkway surrounded by vegetation, before you go inside and down an escalator to the next level, below.

At each level, there鈥檚 something different: one level, for example, has dozens of fabulous orchids. At another, there鈥檚 the Crystal Mountain (mining for crystals is decimating rainforests). There鈥檚 a Rainforest Gallery and a Rainforest Theatre, both aiming to inform and sensitize visitors to the importance of preserving rainforests. One of the most fascinating gardens is the Secret Garden, which recreates a Jurassic era forest, complete with cycads (which used to be favourite food for the dinosaurs) and miniature orchids so tiny that magnifying glasses are positioned in front of them, to allow you to actually see the flowers.

Two areas鈥攖he Children鈥檚 Garden and the OCBC skywalk鈥攚ere closed for maintenance when we visited, so we didn鈥檛 see those.

The outdoor areas of the gardens are open from 5 AM to 2 AM; the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest open from 9 AM TO 9 PM. Although we ended up spending all our time in the Cloud Forest after dark, I would strongly recommend making sure you鈥檙e here during daylight, because I鈥檓 certain it will look way better in daylight鈥攅specially those orchids!

The gardens area also includes toilets, a visitor information centre, several restaurants and caf茅s, and at the ground floor of Cloud Forest, a large souvenir shop with some really nice souvenirs, including jewellery, bookmarks, key chains etc using orchids and other flowers, leaves, twigs etc from the gardens themselves.

An absolute must-do; don鈥檛 miss it.",,
,,great experience,4,,fantastic set up...well run {understandably the queues were lengthy for the mountain}...well set out gardens...everyone seemed to be enjoying the experience....only problem i had was the cloud walk..not liking heights...but i kept to the centre of the walk way...supertree grove was very good...downside was that everyone left at the same time after the show to get to the MRT,,
,,Lovely walk and so amazing gardens,5,,"We were a little hesitant abut paying to go into the flower dome and cloud forest, but it was worth it and we really enjoyed them. They are ""cooled"" so have a jacket if you get cold easily. They are fun and have really cool sculptures around too. Even if you don't want to pay, the free parts of the garden are nice to walk through and we loved the free light show at night.",,
,,Wonderful,5,,These gardens are amazing. You couldn't visit Singapore without going here. Great during the day but also great to see the light show in the evening. A definite must,,
,,Unique concept,5,,This is a fascinating concept and it's great to take pictures of. The real action starts at night when the trees light up and are synchronized with music.,,
,,Amazing place to spend a few hours,5,,"I love this place! We went in the day and spent time chilling in the supertree grove. The sky walk was closed for maintenance (not an issue for me as I don't like heights) but would recommend checking the maintenance schedules which are on the website for those who would want to go up there. We had pre paid tickets to go into the flower dome and cloud forest (whilst they are both amazing, the cloud forest took my breath away, so recommend going in the flower dome first and saving the best til last). Both are surprisingly cool which when it is close to 40' outside was a nice break from the heat. There is plenty of information for keen horticulturists and conservationists for you to really spend a full day here but if like me, you just enjoy to look at, not so much sit and read all the info, its a good few hours. We went back in the evening for the light show in the supertree grove, its free and on every night at 7.45, it is a totally different experience than going in the day and I would recommend doing both. The trees light up to music and it really is mesmerising. Overall great tourist attraction with a good message about conservation.",,
,,Simply 5 star,5,,"Wow...what a place of adventure. The small gardens are OK, but, the two greenhouses and high level walkway are amazing. The large greenhouse with the 35m high mountain and waterfall is unbelievable. This place is without doubt a must do",,

,,Beautiful,5,,Lovely day here Like our Eden project at home Highly recommended well worth a visit Loads to see amazing sculptures,,

,,Breathtaking!! I was nature thrilled,5,,My childred were like in a hugs forest with the large Falls. We werr enthralled with the variety of flowers and plants. I was swooned by the succulents.

I enjoyed the whole experience and although I have travelled to most places in this world I would say that this should not be missed",,
,,Quite spectacular,5,,"Visited at night, when quite quiet - domes were worth every cent of the entry price. Beautifully lit and well-presented, as with pretty much everything in Singapore. Just wish we had left ourselves a little longer than the 2 hours before they shut. Gardens themselves are beautiful. Satay on the Bay, best place for street-style food with endless choices. Highly recommended.",,
,,MRs,1,,Do not buy a ticket from VIATUR it鈥檚 a such a scamming. Very disappointed. And there is no cancellation return.,,
,,Great attraction to spend half a day even with children!,5,,"The Gardens by the Bay are really a wonderful attraction spread out at Marina Bay and behind the huge hotel/casino complex.

Great for families to roam around, with play space and food courts and exhibitions!
Beautifully kept gardens and flowers.",,
,,First time and it鈥檚 remarkable,5,,I came here during my solo trip. I bought the ticket via Traveloka to enter Flower Dome and Cloud Forest.

,,AmaZing.,5,,Singapore are doing all the right things to make their city amazing. What a great place to walk around for free and see the amazing gardens.

,,Nice to see and pass couple of hours,4,,"Nice place, lots of flowers, tress etc in door and outdoor so good if the weather turns.
Easy to navigate, plenty of opportunities to take a good picture, shops and places to eat also there.
Couldn鈥檛 do the skywalk as was closed with rain but looked good.
Visit the restaurant
Best place to take a picture of marina bay sands hotel",,
,,Beautiful array of flowers and exotic plants.,4,,"One of the top Singapore highlights. Just Awesome to see so beautiful flowers and plants, the exotic orchids look very very lovely and to be in this environment is a great feel. Well worth the visit. Keep hydrated as it will be very humid.",,
,,Wow,5,,"Amazing place, super trees are so different to anything I鈥檝e seen before. Definitely go for the light show at 7.45 or 8.45, one of my favourite experiences in Singapore. Satay by the bay is a good place to eat. If doing the walk above the super trees definitely go in the morning, there was no one there around 9",,
,,VISIT TO GARDENS BY THE BAY,5,,The visit was very good and fruitful. We were amazed by all the plants and flowers growing there ....its amazing. We brought along our Indonesian friends and they loved it very much. Will definitely recommend this visit to our overseas friends....I came with my husband who is on wheelchair and he love it very much.,,
,,Very good experience,5,,My family had a good time visiting the two conservatories. Both are baby friendly and the exhibits are all looking great. Few selections of food stalls to choose from though. Overall a must go to place when in Singapore.,,
,,Great attraction,5,,"We spent the whole day at this park. The two glass domed indoor gardens were 2 totally different entities but both magnificent in their own way. The individual gardens in one were all beautifully laid out & very well presented & the other with a 6 storey tower in the centre with enclosed escalator to get to the top & all walkways on the outside to walk down, complete with waterfalls was amazing. Outside were the tree gardens with walkways in between also spectacular. Amazing when lit up at night which we didn't see unfortunately. The gardens & waterways surrounding all these features was beautiful & tranquil to walk through especially in such a busy city.",,
,,Into the future,5,,An attraction that one can revisit again.. a man made floral wonder.. a place where one can experience tranquility .. a must see for tourist,,
,,Real pleasure,5,,This is our third visit to Gardens by the Bay and it really gives us great pleasure every time we go as there is always something new to look at and admire. Wonderful gardens and particularly good to visit in the evening when the lights are on and are dancing to the music.,,

,,"""Beautiful Gardens""",4,,"We visited the 3 gardens by the sea and the botanical gardens in half day. Definitely you should visit it between afternoon and evening so you can enjoy the sound show and the night time light which is worth to see!!
Highly recommended especially for families!!",,
,,A day well spent,5,,"A venue that should not be missed. The design, variety of plants and displays are breathtaking. You certainly find yourself immersed in a different world altogether..
Although you can visit certain parts free, it is well worth paying to access other areas of the gardens which are most interesting. Good value for money. We purchased our tickets in advance from one of the 'City Tours' bus kiosk to avoid the weekend queues. The shop is amazing and offers a wide range of very good quality items for adults and children. Definitely recommended.",,
,,must visit in Singapore,5,,"the admission is free unless you want to visit flower dome and cloud forest. the garden is huge with spectacular supertree grove light up at nights (color-changing show). There is also a bridge that connecting between the giant trees for evening walk. The scenery is very nice with different theme of surrounding garden such as chinese garden, malay garden, boardwalk along the lake with the famous marina bay sands hotel as the backdrop. Totally a great experience to spend your day with your family and friends. the flower dome display is different based on festive seasons.",,
,,Well worth a visit to both,5,,"Both of The Gardens by the bay are worth visiting, they are both different so don鈥檛 do one and not the other. It is not an expensive entry and not too hot inside as you would think. The one that has Gardens from around the world is fascinating realising where some plants and trees originated from, whilst the cloud is very different and you walk right to the top of the dome or should I say escalate to the top and walk down. I suffer with heights and was worried about this but you do not realise that you are high as there is a lot to look at without looking down. The rest of the area where these are has Gardens and lakes which are free and again very nice.",,
,,Awesome,5,,Gardens by the bay is awesome Entire bay is nicely planned & lovely collection of flowers Main highlight is the cloud forest,,
,,Fantastic gardens,5,,These gardens are unbelievably beautiful and a top attraction in Singapore.How plants from different geographical zones have been collected is amazing.The flower dome is absolutely wonderful with colourful plants over a high dome.The gardens provide a beautiful view of the bay and high rise structures.The music show at super tree grove was not as good as expected.Tram is available for those unable to walk.Must visit attraction .,,
,,#1 Thing to do in SIN,5,,If there is one thing you need to do in SIN it is to visit the Gardens - OMG - AMAZING. Make sure you buy tickets to visit both the domes and allow for more than 2 hours if its your first visit. MRT connection is Baylong - easy walk and signage.,,
,,Interesting place to visit,4,,"It is awesome to see a variety of flowers all at once. The day we visited was a raining day, so we were happy to have a nice indoor sightseeing spot to spend a few hours.",,
,,A must visit,5,,My daughter and I visited on our first day in Singapore. It was really beautiful in the 2 domes. Both were so different but equally lovely. The whole area was great and amazing to see what has been made from reclaimed land. A must place to visit.,,
,,Love it!,5,,"Magical place. We did the domes and that was really impressive. Very good combination between nature and some art work. Although there were a lot of people, it did not feel packed at all (this was a weekend). It鈥檚 also a great place to cool down when the heat its getting to you...
Definitely coming back!
Tried the food at the sea food restaurant and that was really god as well.",,
,,Beautiful!,5,,"Really beautiful colourful super trees! Awesome ambience!
It is open till late and very safe!
You can take great pic!
The only downside is that on top of the big tree, there is a bar that you can access only after paying a really high entrance fee (I think was 20 Singapore Dollars per person) and then you need to pay supplementary for the drinks.",,
,,Excellent!,5,,Although I feel a lot more attractions can be added but its still worth the money and time spent there. Beautiful and Amazing,,
,,A must do in Singapore.,5,,One could write screeds on this place and spend days exploring the different pathways and attractions that change if day or night. Take some time to just sit and take it all in. Or try to find the wild Otters. Don鈥檛 miss the giant baby at night.,,
,,Amazing,5,,"The domes are amazing! The variety of plants are incredible and the rainforest experience is outstanding. We were lucky to visit when the dhaila exhibition was on, they were beautiful.",,
,,A must see on a trip to Singapore,4,,We went here one evening and also once during the day when it was quieter. In the evening we saw the light and sound show which was excellent and during the day we walked across the high wire walk which offers good views of the gardens and city. Definitely worth a visit.,,
,,Green!! Green!!,5,,"Amazing place planned with eye on details, giving a fantastic viewing pleasure while creating a vary soothing atmosphere and pleasing for the eye. A meditative experience in the Cloud forest section...night lighting is tremendous",,
,,Beautiful!,5,,"A beautiful light show at night, well worth the trip to get there. Very easy to get there on public transport. I only saw a small part of the gardens due to time restrictions but would definitely visit again to see more.",,
,,Wonderful place to wander.,5,,An amazing and must do activity for any visit to Singapore. These gardens are magnificent and very easy to get to thanks to Singapore's ever efficient MRT. A lovely way to see the city skyline from the aerial walkway.,,
,,Is like being inside Avatar movie,5,,"Is like being inside Avatar movie, I'm not joking. The inside and outside areas were designed to amaze the public. It is an insult to call this space a garden! It is mixed of multiple ecosystems extremely well conserved next to the impressive Sands of the Bay Hotel. A must in Singapur, and saying this in this wonderful city it is a great honour.",,
,,Spectacular,5,,This is a truly spectacular venue. We only saw a portion of what is on offer. The tree lights were magnificent. The Shuttle service made getting around very easy.,,
,,Fantastic garden!,5,,A really huge garden located by the sea. So many things to see. Flower dome is an in-house exhibition with flowers from all over the world. There is also an in-house exhibition over the rain forest-including a waterfall. You almost need half a day to explore so many things. Really nice.,,
,,Absolutely Awesome,5,,"It is a must place to visit whilst in Singapore. loved the Cloud Forest -fascinated& loved the plants and flowers growing up in the mountains. Beautiful flowers and plants -The flower dome was interesting as well . From the skywalk we could see the city skyline.
Definitely come back someday",,
,,Do visit,5,,Excellent but storms meant skywalk closed due to safety issues. Would recommend fantastic collection of dhalias,,
,,Well done and worth a visit.,4,,"If you love plants, this is the place to go. They have an outstanding exhibition of flowers and succulents in the Flower Dome and tropical plants in the Cloud Dome. In the evening they have a light show in the Super Grove at 7:45 and 8:45 pm. Admission is charged for the Domes and OCBC Skyway (to see the light show from up above). Otherwise you can walk through the gardens and see the light show for free. There is a shuttle service for unlimited rides for S$3.",,
,,Beautiful,4,,"This is an amazing place to be with your partner, the flowers, waterfall is breathtaking I suggest you to go in the evening to enjoy the lights too",,
,,Nice night descovery,4,,As nice that it is by day by night it's stunning!!! We had an amazing walk through the park by night!!!,,
,,best viewed at night,5,,huge park lots of walking but a nice to visit try n visit both during the day and at night its 2 differance experiance,,
,,Breathtaking,5,,The best time to view this wonder is around sunset/dawn. Absolutely spectacular and a must when in Singapore!,,
,,must visit in Singapore,5,,"Because the name is 'garden' I thought of a normal garden with trees and grass, but it turned out to be a total attraction. There are so many to enjoy you need a whole day to look around.",,
,,Worth a look,4,,This place is awesome its very crowded literally everyone is taking selfies or you are walking through someone trying to take a photo but still very pretty and a nice way to spend and afternoon.,,
,,A Day at the Gardens,5,,We spent a day at gardens by the bay. It鈥檚 definitely worth seeing if you鈥檙e in Singapore. One of the top places we visited here. The night show is great also. I鈥檇 recommend going before sunset and staying for the light show.,,
,,Great time!,5,,"One of the best place to visit in SG. The best time to go there is at night so u can witness the very colorful lights and its pretty amazing! Awesome place,! You can pay for some bucks to roam around the area...",,
,,Even Dad liked it.,5,,A must see whilst in Singapore. To prove it.... Dad even rated it. Amazing place. Light show at night worth hanging around for. Short walk from Marina Sands across connecting walkway.,,
,,Really nice garden,4,,"There is something to be said about the thousand year old huge trees they have successfully moved into the bio-domes. A lot of care and attention went into shipping huge trees from around the world, and they are blooming and healthy!

I spent all day here roaming around both the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest, plus the numerous outdoor gardens. Plenty to see and experience, plus very easy to get to via the MRT.

Well worth the visit when in Singapore. There are literally hundreds of thousands of flowering plants, trees and bushes from across the world here. Very well done!",,
,,Amazing!,5,,"During the day you can walk around the gardens and admire all of the work they have put into this free tourist attraction. If you want to pay extra there are greenhouse-like domes you can go in full of plants and flowers. There are also lots of cafes and restaurants and it is easy to get to via bus or taxi.
Even if you explore it during the day, make sure you go back at night to see the trees all lit up and the free music and light show they put on in the evenings. Walking amongst the tree tops is also a must in order to get a different view of the park.",,
,,"Amazing, Amazing, Amazing",5,,There is so much that could be said for this attraction. If you are contemplating wether to go or not let this review conform for you it鈥檚 a must.,,
,,Go in the early morning for a quiet time,5,,"Don鈥檛 leave Singapore without visiting Gardens by the Bay. If you have time,
I鈥檇 suggest you go twice: in the evening to see the lights of the supertrees and surrounding area, and then in the early morning, when no one is around, to enjoy the quietness of this place. I visited the green houses at 9am right when they opened and it was great - we were by ourselves for a little while. It is very beautiful and looked after to the detail inside; it won鈥檛 disappoint.",,
,,Magical..,5,,A great way to spend some time and one of the best attractions in Singapore. A great way to spend 4 hours ...lots to see and do... Very colourful and very well laid out.. 10 % reduction when flying Singapore airlines....,,
,,Well worth a visit,4,,"We spent half a day visiting the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest. Well worth the time and money.
A short walk from Marina Bay Sands and easy access to the MRT.
Flowers very beautiful. We visited fairly early early on a Friday and it was not too busy. Not sure what it would look like over a weekend..
My only negative feedback is the state of some of the bathrooms. A lot of Asian women still do not know how to use a bathroom ! !",,
,,Beautiful,5,,I enjoyed the large scale of the Gardens and how lush and abundant the foliage was. My friend and I kept joking that we felt like we were in Jurassic Park to give you a sense of how the foliage appears here.,,
,,Incredible,5,,The gardens the pathwAys the water the views I can't even describe how Beautiful everything was the architecture the cleanliness it was all incredible Wouldn't do a tour was easy to walk through on our own,,
,,Nice place for family trip,3,,"It is a beautiful garden for families who enjoy seeing flowers and greens. Admissions are required for the two indoor gardens, skywalks and shuttle cars. Other outdoor areas are basically free. As for outdoors, watch the weather; it could get quite hot during the afternoon or no place to hide from rain.",,
,,Very beautiful place.,5,,I love this place. Very beautiful & peaceful. Just take a Mrt to Bayfront and you can directly to the garden. Walk along the garden at night and its free. The largest tree with colourful light. Will come back again..,,
,,Nice place but it is not wonderful,3,,If some one like plant I recommend this place. But if you what pay money I suggest another thing to visit.,,
,,The most beautiful garden in SE Asia,5,,"I didn't know what to expect when I started out for GBTB. A beautiful garden perhaps! Like most of Singapore's attractions it's easily accessible by Metro. Tickets cost 28 Sg$ per person. There is a wonderful skywalk, from where one can look down upon GBTB and click beautiful pics.
There are two massive conservatories, Flower Dome & Cloud Forest. Both must be visited. The sheer variety of flowers & the beautiful display with perfect lighting is difficult to describe. Each would take a minimum of 2hrs with the obligatory pictures & selfies ( difficult to resist).",,
,,Not to be missed,5,,Well worth a visit. Exceeded expectations and better than Kew Gardens in London. Places to eat and so much to explore. The two conservatories were amazing.,,
,,Absolute must,5,,Its a free attraction apart from entering the domes.. its an amazing experience a must see. The urban trees are fantastic especially when lit up.,,
,,"Nice space, conveniently located to make a few trips",4,,The gardens are quite lush and I like that they're filled with plants native to the region. I did not visit the Cloud Forest but instead strolled around the different gardens. Places by the water are peaceful and picturesque.,,
,,Such an artificial garden!,3,,"In terms of architecture and concept, it is a great idea to build a giant articial forest amidst Singaporean massive buildings. However, it is too expensive. Better to visit Borneo for the true sights of tropical rainforest.",,
,,Always worth a trip and a must see,4,,"We had two hours free time during our last trip to Singapore and we directly took a taxi and went to the Gardens. Even if you only have very little time, it is worth it.
I suggest you take a Taxi to the Marina Sands Hotel. It is very impressive to walk through this hotel and from the hotel there is a direct way to the gardens which are located directly behind the Marina Sands Hotel. Like this you get to see both, the inside of the hotel and the gardens. Don't worry there are lots of tourists, the hotel allows people to pass through.

The Gardens itself are stunning and very beautiful especially by night. But even if you go there in the morning hours it is worth to see it at least once in your lifetime :-)

The entrance to the Hotel or to the Garden is free, however if you want to go to the Skyway - the bridge who connects the trees - you would need to pay an entrance fee.",,
,,"Beautiful, but very artificial",3,,"A very pretty park, but the whole place looks too well done. Not a leaf is out of place, which makes it appear very man made. Between this and the Southern Ridges, I much prefer the latter, which is a 10 km walk through a number of parks (see my review on this walk).
We used ofo share bikes (free till 4 Feb 2018) and rode along the water and covered some distance quite easily. Much easier than waking in the heat and humidity. Highly recommended.",,
,,Interesting,5,,Purchased ticket for the Flower Dome and Cloud forest. Also paid $3.00 for the shuttle which was worth it. The Flower Dome had a lot of interesting displays along with a cactus section. The Cloud Forest had a very large water fall. Including gardens. It was worth the visit.,,
,,"A fun, wondrous time had by all!",5,,"We went to the flower dome and cloud forest, what can i say! I was stupified buy the cloud forest. The concept and execution is wondrous. We enjoyed the story told and learning about survival of plants in time and changes.",,
,,As you鈥檇 expect,5,,This was absolutely breath taking. It鈥檚 kept really well. I would say make sure you leave plenty of time as there is so much to do and see.,,
,,A Beatiful Way to Spend the Day,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is a series of gardens and parks in the Marina Bay area, close to the landmark Marina Bay Sands.
Value: The open gardens are free but a fee is charged for the atriums - and well worth the money if you're a garden lover.
Amenities: A number of public (and very clean toilets), cafes and shops are within the atrium complex. The two atrium are for flowers of the world (the Australia exhibit is excellent) and alpine vegetation. The former is easy to walk around and the latter takes you to the top of atrium's waterfall for you to experience alpine flora on a variety of levels (the gangways rock a little, so they might not suit everyone).
Outside the atriums in the parks are the giant artificial trees - good for some photos and for seeing illuminated at night. A restaurant is at the top of one of these trees.
Accessibility: Elevators and ramps make the atriums easy to navigate. The gardens are connected with good paths. Plenty of parking as well bridges connecting to the Marina Bay Sands hotel and shops.",,
,,A Marvel That Will Not Disappoint You!,5,,"Allow several hours for this popular attraction. My jaw dropping favorite was the Cloud Forest conservatory. So beautiful and so much educational value in touring this facility. Along with the National Orchid Garden within the Singapore Botanic Garden, two must see places to visit, in my opinion.",,
,,Always a great experience,4,,"I come here for runs and walks. The greenery is great, and there is ample space for people to walk about. Kids also have a great time as well. Good for relaxing.",,
,,Pretty,4,,"A nice place for an evening walk and dinner at the Good Court, especially if you like Satay, with a good selection at Satay By the Bay.",,
,,Still Fabulous,5,,"This is a return trip for us. There is a seasonal garden is changed for various events, the current one being for Chinese New Year. The gardens keep up a very high standard, its nice and cool and a great place to be when it rains. Its an easy walk from esplanade along the bay and over the helix bridge. For eating there are some expensive eating in the flower dome, but just outside is Bakerzin, good food and relatively not expensive seeing you are in a major tourist attraction.",,
,,The cloud dome is amazong,5,,"The flower and cloud domes are so worth visiting. The misting in the cloud dome is worth waiting for. It isn鈥檛 a sudden flood but the mists add to the atmosphere in this amazing mountain of plants which are in immaculate condition. As ever in Singapore the place is spotless but plants are allowed to dangle and spread naturally. The orchid displays in the flower dome are lovely.
The dahlia tour was run by a shy girl who was doing it for the first time. She tried hard but needs more confidence!
The gardens are peaceful early on in the day but become crowded later on

We had a great day but signage is poor since finding refreshments and toilets meant using the map which is not quite as great as it could be.

Thank you",,
,,Awsome experience,5,,"Everybody should see it, even those who are not really interested in nature thing. It was amazing to see all these flowers, trees, plans, etc. Definitely it is the place to be.",,
,,Majestic view! Excellent Place! Must see for all Traveler!,5,,"I am not a nature lover person but this garden amazes me a lot. The combined aspects of engineering and architectural with nature are beyond amazing for me and really makes you think ""How do they come up with this idea?"" I strongly suggest to come to this place at night for beautiful light and avoid weekends if can, the queue can be long and the place will be crowded",,
,,It鈥檚 nice but during Xmas holiday not recommended,3,,"Nice place but every body was there as it was end of December holiday. If you are in Singapore, it is a must to visit",,
,,Modern arboretum,5,,"Gardens by the bay is very Singapore - Clean, precise, and well presented.

Best time to visit is around 1700-1800h. Walk the skyway to watch the sunset, stick around for the evening light show, the garden dome and waterfall is nice regardless of time.

Dedicate an evening to this place, it's spectacular. The experience will cost around $50SGD, depending on the activities. $28SGD for the basic entry which includes the 2 domes; Skyway and any themed areas (e.g. Christmas, Chinese New Year, etc.) are extra.",,
,,Fantastic well worth it,5,,Fantastic with lots of activity. Make your way to the food court outdoors a walk from main venue for fantastic satay or eat in the skyview restaurant reasonable prices and deals. Only problem is the taxi queues when the show is over so be prepared. The show and entry is free singer there early for a good spot on the lawn.,,
,,Amazing place to visit,5,,"Spent the afternoon/evening there, it was an amazing place to see, both Domes was well the worth a visit. NIght show .. spectacular! Would go there again next time if we ever visit Singapore again.",,
,,Rainy day in Singapore,5,,What a fabulous 3.5 hours we spent in the Flower Dome and Cloud forest. A truly unique experience which ensured we did not have to worry about the rain whilst waiting to join our cruise ship. Would recommend anyone to visit whilst in Singapore. A leisurely walk around the outside gardens is beautiful too.,,
,,Unexpected Natural Wonder in Singapore,5,,"Visited gardens by the bay, a massive complex devoted to sustainability and educating visitors as to the earth's delicate ecological balance. The cloud forest is a climate controlled microcosm of our planetary flora and fauna, not to mention a cool refuge from the Singaporean heat and humidity. Easily a three hour visit",,
,,Beautiful Place,5,,Very beautiful place indeed. Both flower dome and cloud forest are amazing. You can spend hours in there just roaming around if you like plants and flowers. Super trees are very beautiful in the night. Light show in the night is a must see.,,
,,Light and music show out of this world,5,,"I had the chance to see this music and light show and I have no word to express how good it is, I've seen the one in Parthenon in Athens and one in Las Vegas but this is incredibly good!
Worth visiting 2 or 3 times more.
Go early and bring something do you can lay down in the floor, forget about taking pictures.. leave that for your second visit!
Just relax snd enjoy with all your senses the best 15 minutes ever... and for free!",,
,,The most beautiful garden I've ever experienced,5,,Gardens by the Bay is an absolute must when you are in Singapore. The Cloud Forest was closed during my visit by the gardens were totally stunning.,,
,,Absolute must-see,5,,"Spectacular and worth every cent. The cloud forest gives and gives, is breathtaking. The lights display at night is not to be missed. Best time to visit is about 4pm to enable one catch the displays.",,
,,A real jewel!,5,,"No photo, or words can adequately describe this work of art. It's breathtaking! It was such a surprise to see the beautiful plants of the different regions in South Africa so wonderfully exhibited. One could spend hours roaming in this beautiful space.",,
,,Loved it,5,,Kids can stay here for the whole day without a doubt. Don't forget to bring the swimming suit as there is a nice wet area for them to play!,,
,,Awesome food at Satay City,5,,Went to Satay City which is right in the middle and the food was unbelievably good lots of hawker stands to choose from and cheap,,
,,NEVER MISS this Heaven on Earth,5,,"There two conservatories. One is the Flower Garden and the other is the cloud forest. If you got limited time go through the Flower garden quickly(1hr) and rush to the Cloud forest,( for me this is the best) where you need at least 2 hours. Both domes are air conditioned so you can visit at any time but make it before 8pm coz they close at 9 pm. Go there around 3pm in the evening. You have to see these domes in sunlight as well as in Artificial light(night). it is two different experiences. One might say it is expensive but i would say it is worth the amount you have paid. They have put so much effort to make these the best among all attractions in Singapore",,
,,Can spend several days here!,5,,"A bucket list item for your first, second or thirtieth visit to Singapore. Lot's to see plenty to do and some of it for free! Get ready to pack your walking shoes though.",,
,,Well worth a visit,4,,"Not as good as the Botanical Gardens but well worth a visit. The two giant greenhouses have very different themes. The first will take you around the world, displaying all types of plant life and trees. Most interesting are the cacti.

The second greenhouse is far more spectacular and features a massive water fall. This will keep the children entertained far more easily than the first greenhouse. The journey to the top is well worth it and the walk back down very enjoyable. You should be able to see the lot in under three hours.",,
,,Wonderful light show,5,,Mainly free gardens to walk around and a light show every evening well worth watching. There's a charge to go into the cloud forest and the flower area both undercover. A few cafes on site too,,
,,A Must See in any Visit to Singapore,5,,"We had a three night stopover on the way yo Stu Lanka with family and visited this area a number of times.

We ate at the Satay by the bay, day the tree lights how , wandered around and visited the Cloud Dome. All excellent. You can also get discounts with your Singapore Airlines boarding pass.

All of this area has been done so well, don't miss seeing all it had to offer.",,
,,Beautiful & Relaxing,5,,"We attended here on Monday 21/1/18. It was a fascinating sight to see the man-made flower structures. These structures of course also gave access to the Sky Walk which in turn provided a magnificent view of the luscious gardens. Flora & Forrest domes were well worth seeing.
FYI there is a Taxi Rank at the centre of the gardens, tourists can be dropped off and picked up. Very convenient when you want to escape the heat of the day.
Well worth the visit. Highly Recommended.",,
,,Absolute Marvel,5,,Really pleasant resemblance of James Cameron Avatar landscape. Very thoughtfully designed gardens with magic super trees. Highly recommended walk during the day and certainly a must visit during the evening. Flower dome and cloud forest do require purchase of the tickets but is very worth while in particular flower dome. If you wish to visit them at night (as you should ) remember to get your stamp at the exit so you are entitled multiple entries for that day,,
,,Gardens By The Bay,5,,"This a very neat place, In the day light, it is colorful and amazing. But at night, it is awesome. The solar-powered trees are almost surreal; can't take enough photos of them. And they are right next to the massive ""ship"" that dominates much of the Singapore skyline.",,
,,A must-see for all gardeners and plant enthusiasts!,4,,This is a double greenhouse complex (one is damp and cooled to replicate 2000 ft altitude). Lots of walking or take a wheelchair. There are lifts to the various levels.,,
,,Beautiful gardens and waterfall!,5,,"This place was amazing. Never seen anything like it. The gardens were beautiful, the waterfall was spectacular! There is so many plants, trees and flowers that you could spend all night there.",,
,,Just stunning,5,,"Go before sunset to watch the sun go down and the lights of the Gardens come on. Although I didn't use the restaurant nor bridge in the trees, I thoroughly enjoyed this experience.",,
,,One of a kind,5,,"Never experienced anything like this before, was a little overcrowded however it was the end of December so peak season. I was unaware before going here that if you want to do the skyway you only get 30mins up there. We were lucky enough to be up there for the music/light show which was excellent. A must do when in Singapore",,
,,Great places for photo taking,5,,"A great place for photo taking. scrolling in the gardens looking at the plants made you feel relax. Don't rush..... take your time. Go during the late afternoon, so you can go into the night to enjoy the garden in the night time.",,
,,Wonderful gardens,5,,"This place was worth the visit, for sure. I can鈥檛 imagine how many millions of $ was spent to build this, but what a great creation. Very cool temperature inside the rainforest and a good way to cool down.",,
,,Spectacular!,5,,"It is one of the must-do items that should make your list when you visit Singapore. Easy access, great views!",,
,,Proud establishment for a Singaporean,5,,There is a good mix of free sights such as the park surrounding the 2 main greenhouses that can keep u occupied for an hour or odd exploring the greenery. The flower dome and the cloud dome are slightly different. The flower dome is often recurated based on a different theme while the cloud dome shows you the different flora a different altitude.... Stay till the night and the area transforms... Music and light show around the super tree gives you a completely feeling from the daytime. A must go,,
,,Definitely worth a visit,5,,"Nice to walk through the garden only have to pay entrance to the flower dome and cloud forest. Worth paying, cloud forest was my favourite of the two :)",,
,,For Unforgettable Experiece,5,,"Superb, must to do activity. Incredible manmade structure built to house Flora & Fauna from all over the world. Cloud forest and flower dom are must visit activities. You can also add sky walk for additional payment of around of SG$ 8. Please remember to buy tickets before 8 pm.
You must at the site by 4 to 5 pm to enjoy everything comfortably.
It all houses world's tallest indoor water fall a mesmerising sight for the eyes.",,
,,A good time to spend,4,,We visited the place on 19/01/18 evening. It was good to see. Such a huge structure and beautiful garden in such a height. Awesome and amazing.,,
,,UK's Eden Project in Singapore but 5*,5,,"I wasn't sure but once you enter the cool domes you will be amazed by the tropical, semi-tropical and other climate trees, flowers and even more amazing wooden sculptures",,
,,More than a million plant,5,,Such a great place in Singapore. 3 days in the row for visiting this place. The light and sound are just amazing. Highly recommended for people who love the nature.,,
,,A MUST if in Singapore,5,,"If you love greenery, flowers, & exotic flowers then you'll LOVE this place. I didn't expect how big the 2 domes were. One was larger (Cloud Forest) than the other. I haven't been in many around the world but this is definitely #1 on my list. So beautiful. You can go at your own pace...but depending on how quickly you go thru maybe 1.5-2.5 hour+ total for both indoor domes. It is cool in there so bring a light cardigan/sweater if you're cold by nature....Thank goodness I did. At first I thought the $28 SGD was a bit much but I think it's ok seeing how extensive it is.
Restaurants are both inside/outside the Domes. I went to Pollen which was good but EXPENSIVE.",,
,,Gorgeous!,5,,We loved the gardens and the variety of fauna was amazing. Singapore is full of greenery and you can see it best here.,,
,,A must see on a visit to Singapore,5,,Reasonably priced tickets and well worth the money. Beautifully done. Best time to go is in the evening around 5 so you can then also see the light shows which are at 745 and 845 after walking around the gardens.,,
,,Fame gardens n forest dome,5,,"I used to not bring my foreign visitors to garden by the Bay because I think the foreigners country has all the beautiful season that surpassed our showcase here. So for few years, I always tell them it鈥檚 nothing but expensive. When spore celebrated its 50 birthday, there was great discount. A group of friends decided to bring the elderly along n I was a volunteer. It changed my mind concept after it. And I always spend on it nowadays to bring old n young there. The outcome is they were awe when looking what spore can create like something out of nothing. It shows our small country embraces nature. Best of all it is airconditioned. A few of my friends from neighbouring country were very impressed and sad because their country has all resources these but could not properly do it like spore. I was worried young children might find it boring but the Space is there n children enjoy space in the garden domes. I just hope the food area has better quality food. Thank you Singapore.",,
,,Fabulous to see,5,,"If taking the hop on hop off bus make sure you get green line otherwise you are let off at a stop on the street,it is a long walk in the heat",,
,,Do not miss this on your visit to Singapore.,5,,To see it is to believe it. Get on the MRT and be transported to a wonderful display. Even if you qre not into plants. You cannot miss this collection of vegetation from all overvthe world. This facility is air conditioned so viewing is comfortable in rhe Singapore humidity.,,
,,A must see attraction,5,,If you ever saw the movie Avatar then this place will remind you of the beautiful scenery in that film. Absolutely spectacular array of flowers wood carvings plant life uniquely displayed unlike any other garden,,
,,Stunning Gardens with a difference,5,,"Spent a whole morning at this lovely attraction.
Free access to the park. You can take a short walk (10 mins) or take a shuttle bus at S$3 each.
There are a number of large 'trees' which are made of metal frames with plants climbing/growing up them. In a few years the frames will have disappeared under the growth.
S$8 each for access to the sky walk for a bird's eye view of the park, Singapore Flyer, Marina Bay, Ponds and Port area - not for people affraid of heights!! Well worth it.
We visited on an overcast day which was ideal as it would be uncomfortable on a sunny day.",,
,,Beautiful gardens with lots of activities for kids,5,,"Went here with my husband and 6 year old son. We all loved it. Spent hours wandering around the different gardens...The views over the city are spectacular. Visited the cloud forest which was beautiful. Unexpected bonus - the environmental documentaries and exhibition at the bottom. My son found this really interesting and is keen to be more green at home. Really like that the gardens are working on sustainability.
My boy also loved the children's garden and activities. Tree houses, spider nets, obstacles and a water play area for cooling off...perfect!",,
,,One of the best Gardens that we have visited.,5,,"We visited the Flower Dome, a climate controlled enclosure with flowers of a European summer or North Indian spring. Really attractive displays.
The other dome is Cloud Forest - a recreated rain-forest that features the tallest artificial waterfall.
Particularly fascinating was the short film on Global-warming & the 6th Mass-Extinction in the geological history of our planet, currently underway",,
,,Wet but a must see,4,,"Get lift to top of sustainable garden and walk down. I believe best done at night, walk through gardens until dark then get into this.",,
,,Worth a visit,4,,We visited the cloud forest late afternoon so we could then watch the light show. This seemed to be a popular time to visit as the numbers increased. We had a small wait hour the lift to the top in the cloud forest and it was crowded in a few spots but the crowd moved quite well. There were lots of wood carvings that were very interesting. We watched the light show from directly underneath but I think it would be better form a little further away. The light show was good but not fantastic.,,
,,Stunning,5,,"We went on a weekend so it was extremely busy better to try a weekday. You may need a little cover up as the temperature is around 18c.
Stunning displays and fascinating sculptures with a wide variety of plants and trees but all done with taste.
Well organized and quite a lot of walking involved so take the shuttle buses. It鈥檚 not inexpensive but worth it just to get out of the heat of Singapore.",,
,,New Botanic Gardens,5,,"We have been several times before but never visited the domes. This time we went on the Skywalk (I realised I suffered from vertigo on this walk!) and into both domes. A little bit pricey for tourists (cheaper for residents) but it was worth every penny. If you are at all interested in flowers and plants, this is just an amazing experience. We both loved it and spent hours looking at everything. Took wonderful photos so will have lots of happy memories.",,
,,beautiful gardens,5,,by all means go to see the Gardens! it will delight you with the most amaizing species of flowers and cacti and things you have never seen before!,,
,,The Great Garden,5,,I do like this garden. The consep is very amazing. I hope this place will be better in the future. Very nice,,
,,Dazzling Event,5,,"My husband and I visited the Gardens by the Bay one evening to watch the lighting effect which was fabulous. The lighting was to music which was really well done.
We were so amazed at the number of people who attended the free event. Even so, when it was finished it only took about 10 minutes to walk and find a taxi. The orderly way people left the show was extraordinary.
A worthwhile event!",,
,,Worth a visit,4,,"A walk around the gardens is a must whilst in Singapore especially if the weather is good. Its free for the gardens but if you wish to visit the flower dome, cloud forest and OCBC sky way then there is an entry fee, but it is worth it. Both domes are air conditioned so its great to get out of the heat. Took a Taxi from our Hotel at Clarke Quay which was quite cheap so I would recommend this. You can visit by MRT but we just travelled around by Taxi as it was good value. We left via the Marina bay sands exit and travelled to the top floor 57 to take a view of the surrounding area free from the small viewing area.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,"Loved Gardens by the Bay and the flowers were out of this world, I saw Tulips all beautiful colours and at night the light show was lovely.",,
,,Spectacular Interior Gardens and Forests,5,,This was the highlight of our trip to Singapore mainly because my wife and I have never seen anything like it in our travels globally. The gardens and forests are stunning and the engineering of the facility is a marvel in itself. The cloud forest included the world's tallest indoor waterfall that has to be at least 200' tall. If I am wrong about the height it doesn't matter because it is absolutely amazing. No one should miss visiting Gardens By The Bay when visiting Singapore.,,
,,Fanstatic and a must visit,5,,A visit to the Garden by the Bay is highly recommended. The domes house an exhaustive collection of flora from across the globe. Ideal time to visit the domes is late afternoon and be prepared to spend a good 2-3 hours at least taking in the beautiful sights.,,
,,Amazing life time adventure,4,,Azmaing place so many plants and trees from different countries. You can see all species of trees and plant. Cloud forest is amazing with 60 feet waterfall . Don't miss the super tree light and music show which starts at 745 and 845 every evening .,,
,,Impressive collection of plants and trees from various parts of the world in a single location,4,,"A very good experience. Mainly consists of two large domed area - one housing tropical plants and the other partly flowering plants, large olive trees of atleast 25 years old. Tropical garden had a wide variety of plants from all around the world. At night there are two sound and light show which is was impressive. There are also country theme gardens from China and India. Also shops that sell souvenirs, books etc. Few restaurants are also available fr dining. Overall a good experience. admission fee is S$28 for the garden. The Skywalk was closed on the day I visited and to use same there is an extra fee",,
,,Absolutely amazing!,5,,"We could only spend a few hours here and due to the rain, the tree tops walk was closed, however we visited both domes which were really impressive! We took the shuttle bus around the gardens which gave us a really good overview in the time we had. It is well worth spending much more time here which we will definitely do on our next visit to Singapore!",,
,,Beautiful place,5,,Man made art.....great work. One visit is a must. The Flower groves look amazing at night with all the lights.,,
,,A must visit when in Singapore,5,,"Read about Gardens on the Bay on Trip Advisor and booked the trip while in the U.K. which saved having to queue for tickets on the day. I was picked up at 9 am and didn鈥檛 get back to my hotel till 6pm. My ticket allowed for entry to the garden dome which is a mass of flora and fauna and also to the mountain dome which is like a mountain with Waterfalls and different types of vegetation, flowers including some beautiful orchids and trees. As you descend, inside the mountain there are various levels with different exhibits including cinema showing effects of global warming past and present, another showing screens of creation of the earth till present times. There is a beautiful lake to wonder round taking in the various types of garden en route- children鈥檚 garden, Malaysian etc etc inside the garden dome there is a small cafe for morning coffee and many places throughout the gardens having places to eat and drink in varying price ranges. Well worth a visit and with hotel pick up and adult admission for around 拢20 I thought it was good value.",,
,,nice place to visit,3,,This place is a display of plants and certainly interesting. The admission price is not cheap but it's on the 'must see' list for Singapore.,,
,,Walk in the modern greenery,4,,"The place is one of the must-go when you are in Singapore. You could look at the fusion between architecture and nature in this place! However, to further enter the various domes, you need to pay for the admission.",,
,,Otters,4,,Best place to see Singapore wild Otters. Go early morning for better chance of catching them having Breakfast.,,
,,Beautiful,4,,We visited flower dome and cloud forest and would recommend both. Visit there when there is still daylight. Otherwise it can be quite dark and you don't get the best of it. Cloud forest takes almost 45 minutes to go thru (there should definitely be some short cuts to use). After gardens go to see Supertree Grove show.,,
,,Fabulous!,5,,Not only did we receive a senior discount as we are over 60 but on proving we travelled with Singapore airlines we were awarded a further discount to the flower and cloud gardens. The staff were great and very accomodating.,,
,,Insane.,5,,"Read the title, it鈥檚 just unreal. Awesome views and if you watch the fountains and light shows you will be amazed. If you visit Singapore, don鈥檛 miss this!",,
,,Great Green Space,5,,"The 3 Gardens by the Sea and the Botanical Gardens offer a serene feeling while you are walking around in them, viewing them from the top of the Bay Harbor Hotel, a passing boat, a tour bus or taxi. The night time light and sound show featuring the Super Trees is enchanting. One of the top destinations in Singapore.",,
,,One of the best newer attractions in Singapore,5,,A really tremendous job has been achieved here with reclamation. water and botanic planting. The glass domes are impressive and there is a great view from the aerial walkway.,,
,,A lovely walk inside a big city,5,,If you don't see the top of some buildings you can forget for a moment to be in Singapore. You can admire some tropical plants and flowers just walking outside the dooms.,,
,,Excellent,4,,Good place for photography. Must attend light show (at 7:45pm and 8:45 pm). Its right next to Marina sand bay.,,
,,great place to relax,5,,"With beautiful flowers and plants, it's a great place to take stroll and relax with your family, friends, or alone. Better if you go in the morning or late evening if you don't like the sun like me.",,
,,Super,5,,"A must visit for all visiting Singapore. An amazing collection of flowers, trees etc from across the globe.",,
,,Very unique if you like flowers and plants,4,,It was a beautiful area full of all kinds of flowers and trees. We only went to cloud forest and flower dome. Only these two places need 3 - 4 hours to enjoy fully. It is a perfectly arranged garden with a lot of facilities.,,
,,Anazing garden,5,,We visited here with my friends.The flowers are so beautiful.6Like walking in the gardens paradise.I will come back,,
,,"Nice Place, Relaxing and calm",4,,"Great place for a relaxing stroll, with time to kill, its free entry for the areas outside the dome (but you're at the mercy of the Singapore weather), so if you don't intend to enter the dome you don't have to pay.

Its 2 separate domes, the ""flower dome"" and ""cloud forest"", you can probably guess from the names what are in those domes. Nice air conditioned temperatures. Tickets are cheaper for locals than for foreigners. So if you do want to go in buy your tickets online before hand, its a lot cheaper.",,
,,Great place to visit,5,,Great views and tons to see with just one ticket. Definitely will come back to visit the rest of the attracts here.,,
,,Another world!,5,,"Prepare to enter another world when visiting the gardens by the bay on an evening. The light shows are at 7:45 and 8:45 however you鈥檒l find yourself watching both. Fantastic lights and beautiful music accompanied the show. So just lay back, enjoy and prepare to get lost in another world",,
,,night visit at the garden,4,,although you will not be able to see clearly the flowers at the night there is a different kind of atmosphere when you go at night and it is much cooler too than a day visit the lights are also spectacular .you take the subway going there and then go to the marina bay sands which is just beside it,,
,,Stunning views and wide variety of flowers,5,,Definitely a must-go for flowers lovers. beautiful man-made waterfall. can be quite cold inside the domes so a jacket is handy.,,
,,heaven of the earth,5,,Gardens by the Bay can very easily be reached by alighting the MRT at Bayfront Station and taking exit B and then cross the Dragon Lake. I could say Gardens by the Bay is really an amazing place to spend a whole day...,,
,,Super Trees light the night!,4,,"We were here specifically to see the laser light show of the Super Trees - showing every night at 7:45 and 8:45. Truly a sight to behold. Very different and beautiful, especially on a warm evening. While there are trees here and there, make sure you get to the Super Tree Grove for the light show.",,
,,Beautiful displays,5,,"I love coming to Gardens by the Bay as they maintain the gardens so well. The two conservatories: Flowerdome and Cloud Forest are regularly changed in their themes due to different festive seasons or inspirations, so I never feel bored coming here! The OCBC Skywalk has a stunning view of Marina Bay Sands and the whole of Gardens by the Bay and its surrounding. A must for those who are dare to be up there!

If you are there with the little ones, the children's waterpark is a must! With the Singapore heat and all the walking, the kids will love this!

N.B. Must check for closures of conservatories and waterpark, they do regularly maintain them. So don't miss out going to one of them due to closure!",,
,,Family oriented,5,,"Although there are alot of tourists all year round, the management never fails to take care of the locals especially families. We felt welcomed and enjoyed the fast and orderly queue when getting our tickets.",,
,,Nice wander avout,4,,Free to enter... Nice wonder around. Keep your eyes peeled for wildlife. Including otters! Satay by the bay is a bit on the expensive side. No wonder it was deserted!,,
,,Beautiful garden landscape & waterfal,4,,Both dome are fully air conditioned. Easy to walk around with elderly too. Many varieties of flowers to see. Great getaway for a hot country like Singapore.,,
,,Great unique attraction,5,,Although not a green thumb the gardens were amazing and well designed - walking through was very tranquil and the night look guys were spectacular- the trees were beautiful.,,
,,Let your imagination run in the Gardens,5,,"Does this look like ...... yes it is. No it鈥檚 not the real one. Dinosaurs extinct before we were born.
Besides flowers, you get to see plants and logs crafted into popular imaginary characters. It was a rainy day when I was there. The rain falls in the glass roof top and I feel like we are under the sea.

Definitely going back and definitely picking a raining day.",,
,,Amazing must see rain or shine,5,,"I came here in December and due to time I only had an hour or two here so didn't get to see everything, it was pouring with rain the day I went too but it was absolutely worth it can't recommend more it's incredible if you can see it in the day and evening for the lights it really is beautiful.",,
,,Interesting,4,,Have visited the Garden by the Bay many times but it is never boring! It is easy to get there on the MRT. The exhibit in one of the Dome changes every month or so? My visitors from overseas always love what they see here. It is disabled friendly with ramps and lifts.,,
,,MUST GO HERE,5,,"Although the weather didn鈥檛 work out to do the skywalk, we managed to get in two viewings of the musical light show- which was Christmas themed and SO enjoyable. We also went to the cloud garden which was just absolutely amazing. You start at the top of a mountain and work your way down, learning about the horticulture as you go. Inspiring work.",,
,,Excellent!,4,,Loved the supertrees! Walked along the pathway and it gave you a good view of the area. The best part was the light show in the evening which was fabulous! Set to music it was a great experience on a balmy evening.,,
,,Incredible!,5,,"A fantastic and well delivered attraction, Gardens by the Bay are a stunning integration of modern architecture and engineering with nature. By day or by night, it is a fantastic place to visit and is very much becoming an iconic Singaporean attraction. During Christmas, they even run special light shows with Christmas music. A must for any visit to Singapore.",,
,,Beautiful end to a great few days!!!,5,,"We were staying at the marina bay sands and it was just across the road. Amazing structure, the walk was a bit expensive for what it was.... we just walked under it and still had a great time.",,
,,Great place for a walk around,4,,"Went for a walk around including paying $8 for the sky walk thought it was well worth it. We skipped the domes due to the price as people will be aware you can spend a lot of money in Singapore in a short time if you choose to do a lot of the upmarket tourist things. Having said that we will probably go to the domes next time.

Gardens themselves are well worth a walk around and are free.",,
,,Good,5,,"This is a lovely free garden. Very spaced out so lots of walking. There are themed gardens like Indian, Chinese etc. You have to purchase tickets for flower and cloud dome and skywalk. At night the trees are lit up and it's magical walking through.",,
,,A real showstopper,5,,Prepare yourself for a treat. This place like Singapore itself is a true man-made Shangri la. The Indian garden is so beautiful as are of course the two dome gardens: the rainforest takes your breath away. Well done Singapore. However I hope people continue to fight against anymore concreting northwards into the true forest.,,
,,Beautiful garden,5,,Went there on a rainy day and the enclosed domes allowed the garden walk experience to be dry and comfortable.:),,
,,Enchanting atmosphere,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is a lovely place to do a walk and if you鈥檙e in for a long walk you can extent by leaving via Marina Barage following the waterside. But besides the Flower dome, Cloud Forest, children鈥檚 garden and Satay by the Bay, The Super Tree Groove is our favourite part! Visit the Super Tree Groove at night during one of the 2 music and light shows, it鈥檚 enchanting!!",,
,,Overhyped,1,,"I visited there just before Christmas. To our surprise, the major attraction the huge flower like structures were closed for some special Christmas festivities and were prices separately. Overly crowded, very hyped. Extremely tiring experience. No easy taxi point for the place. Had to walk all the way to Marina bay casino taxi stand and had to que for 40mins with two Young kids for a taxi. Would never recommend this to anybody.",,
,,Just wow,5,,Walking through the area in a bit dark add a little magical feeling to it. Best experience will be at night,,
,,Breathtaking,5,,"Visited solo as something to kill time. Ended up staying 3hrs and enjoyed every minute of it. Definitely plan to visit during a ""misting"" as the view from any angle is honestly breath taking. I'm a trained scientist and personally enjoy all things outdoors and of this nature so needless to say I had a ball. The crowds are kept at bay by only allowing a few tickets to be sold for each time slot. Take your time walking through the layers both inside of the ""mountain"" and out. The waterfall at the bottom is phenomenal and made for excellent pictures. Plus, from the upper levels, you can see out to the marina on a clear day.",,
,,"breath taking, relaxing overall architecture is great, a spectacular garden!",5,,"Lots of different and varieties of plants, the place is very green, mountain rocks, a cave and a water fall. A really beautiful place with different temperatures for the plants.",,
,,Somewhere MUST go when visit Singapore,5,,"It is a very good place to go, and different from day time and evening time. As there are quite a lot of different kind of plants and floowers are within the ""tower"" and you need to take about 2 ~ 3 hours to go through and it depends upon how much you love the plants and flowers. This is good to see all these with the sunlights in the gree house ""tower"" . However, if you can visit the green tower at about 2 pm or 3 pm, then when you come out of the green tower, it is the evening time, the lighting of the site Garen by the Bay is really fantastic. The lighting is around the tree shape structure and there are a number of them to give the total site a night view scenary spot. It is advised to bring along with your camera to take the great photos there. And Garden by the Bays connected to the land mark hotel called Sands and taking photos of Sands is also another good point.",,
,,Great place to visit in all types of weather,5,,"We opted for a tour because it had been raining on and off all week,really one of the best afternoons in a long time ,so much to do and see . Started with an audio tour for about 20 minutes which give you quite a bit of history on the making of the gardens and areas you would want to spend time in.
The super tree are fantastic and covered in diff climbing and flowering plants .which started to put a light sow on from about 7.30.
The dooms you could spend half a day in each one .one specialising in plants from dry areas and the other from the rain forest.foods-not a problem plenty of eating places.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,This is one of the most beautiful and iconic landmarks of Singapore. Best place to take good photographs,,

,,Beautiful Gardens,5,,"We visited these gardens at the start of December and they are just stunning.The Cloud Dome is absolutely beautiful. We were lucky enough to visit on the first day of the Christmas Winter Wonderland which was very pretty. The light show in the Supertrees to Christmas music was fantastic, just the thing to get us into the Christmas spirit! An absolute 'must-do' when visiting Singapore.",,
,,A must if in Singapore..,5,,We have been in Singapore now three times by cruise ship. The Gardens at the Bay are a must. The development over the last three years has improved the Garden even more. Each year we find new places in the garden we have not seen the previous year. If you want to see more you have to visit the botanical garden with his orchid garden.,,
,,An enjoyable place to visit!,4,,"Great place to enjoy and get close to nature. The place is huge and unless you can really walk, i would advise to take the shuttle service which cost only couple of SGD.",,
,,So hot,4,,Very very hot but the bar on the flower top is nice! Make sure you check the forecast before you go..,,
,,"A little Garden Wonder of the World in the City at at Gardens by the Bay, 18 Marina Gardens Drive, Singapore 018953.",5,,One can find and enjoy the wonder of a great garden right in the city state of Singapore. It's so convenient to reach the destination either by taxi or MRT train.,,
,,Fun day out!,5,,"Great Experience for family.
We walked from train station, Booked the buggy to take us to the Cloud & Garden Domes... Beautiful Gardens and the Waterfall in the Cloud was stunning.
Walked through the gardens outside, got ice cream from McDonalds and went to Kids play water park.
They loved it.
Then we walked down to Satay on the Bay and ate Satay!! YUM!!
Then walked back up to the Artifical Tree light show and enjoyed the lights.
Wonderful day out.",,
,,Outing at Gardens by the Bay,4,,"A nice and serene place to visit. The Cloud Forest itself was mesmerising. With the nice ambience and the cooling environment makes it a place not to be missed. Not to forget the cloudy and smoky like effect touch given. Its a place that is a must visit especially in the evening.

,,Great Singapore Garden,5,,One of the best gardens in the world. Lots of paths to walk on and a great place to see a live band.,,
,,Poorly supervised,3,,"Unfortunately modern parents seem to feel no need to ensure that their young do the right thing by all.

This is very evident here, where children are allowed to run amok to the detriment of those mature people who have actually paid to be there.

Someone has described these attractions as ""the most beautiful place on earth"";the sights are quite impressive, but hardly deserving of such a gushing appellation as ""the most beautiful place..""

My frequent thought was where on earth did they get the stalagmites and stalactites from. This is never answered as you go through

Seriously, the uncontrolled children - and the place is full of them - ruin this for the not-so-sure of their steps, the elderly, and for all decent people.

There is never a sign of a worker to keep these children or their parents in line.

I have just noticed that Tripa apparently wants reviews from ""couples, Family (young children), family (teens), business or solo"", but not from me, a 70-ish bloke who went there with his daughter.

There is no category for one such as I, but I expect I'm not Robinsion Crusoe.; lifto the gamo Tripa, there's a good chap.",,
,,Mesmerizing beauty 馃槉,5,,Its amazing place to visit if you are in Singapore. Its very well maintained and enjoyable any season as its indoors. Ideal family day out,,
,,In Awe!,5,,Free of charge in visiting this site. The amazing idea is just so wow! A garden in the city! So instagrammable.,,
,,Visit once in a life time,3,,A different variety of plants and beautifully planted. Great maintenance .I think it was so - so maybe because there is nothing special for the season I went.,,
,,Amazing experience,5,,"This place was amazing! We visited at night time to check out the free light show, which is definitely worth the visit.",,
,,magical experience at Gardens by the bay!,5,,"This is a beautiful garden, especially early in the morning. Go before 8am when it is quiet. You will also see clear reflections of the supertrees on the water. I feel like i have walked into the set for Avatar!",,

Tansport is handy by cab/ mrt .

You ll love it do come by please, its a pride for all singaporeans n perm residence
Best",,
,,It's like going to future world,5,,"The whole Gardens by the Bay area, starting at the Marina Bay Sands hotel and going out to the water, makes Singapore seem very futuristic. Much of it has to do with the architecture of the hotel, and of the amazing ""trees"" and of course the Cloud forest and flower pavilions, which are both nothing short of amazing. The cloud forest one was our favorite, featuring innovative architecture and flawless implementation of the design concept. I have never been through anything like it anywhere else. It also handles crowds very well, and is a great respite from the usual heat outside. All of the plants are in excellent condition, and they really pull off the concept of different ecological levels within the space. A must see in Singapore. We are going back tonight to experience the entire area with the amazing night lighting, which we observed from our hotel last night.",,
,,scenes changes all the time,5,,"This Garden by the bay you could spend many hours there, what a great scene and how they make it attractive to all ages is amazing.",,
,,Holiday Singapore,5,,"Gardens by the Bay, amazing a must see while in Singapore. A nice day walking around beautiful plants nice restaurants.",,
,,Go at night =),5,,"I would recommend squeezing in a visit to Gardens by the Bay (GBTB) after an evening in town. There is a pedestrian link bridge from Marina Bay Sands leading directly into GBTB. At night, the light up at the Supertree Grove is an awesome spectacle simply not to be missed.

There are many spots to enjoy a view of the towering Supertrees: (1) At the pedestrian link bridge, you can see the Supertrees from a distance; (2) At the perimeter of the Supertree Grove, you can take in a more majestic, close up shot of the light up; and (3) Inside the Supertree Grove, be awestruck in the company of giants - a great place for selfies!

Oh, and from time to time, there may be a musical light show at selected timeslots in the evening (check the website or social media for the latest schedule to see if you get lucky!). The best thing is that it's free for all to enjoy!

Paid attractions at GBTB:

The Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are two carefully curated and temperature controlled (READ: air conditioned) mega greenhouse domes. Each is worth a visit if you are visiting during the day - a great way to escape from either the sweltering heat or the torrential rain. Some of the exhibits are seasonal as well (especially in the flower dome) so do check beforehand. The Skywalk is also a nice place to catch the sunset and is a wonderful place to capture the beauty of GBTB.",,
,,Beautiful nature in the metropolitan!,5,,"Both dome are worth visiting. I always bring my friends from oversea to visit the 2 domes. My personal favorite theme is the tulipmania seasonal theme. Remember to bring a jacket or shawl, it gets pretty chilly inside the dome :)",,
,,Gardens by the Bay,1,,Its expensive and A waste of money and time a fake place to waste your time nothing much to see and taxi is difficult to get.,,
,,Absolutely beautiful,5,,"Stunning view, very beautiful. I walked the bridge at night during the Christmas light show. It was one of the most beautiful experiences I鈥檝e ever had I highly recommend",,
,,Little kids haven!,5,,My 5 year old daughter loves this place as she can play at the water area for unlimited hours. At night we like to watch the lovely super tree light up together as a family. Eateries at the satay by bay offers local delicacies and is a must to stop by.,,
,,Make a date with the Date Palm Trees,4,,"The flower dome is work spending time in, especially under the majestic date palm trees. The cloud forest may also be appealing for people who love heights.",,
,,"Cloud Forest & Flower Dome, amazing double combo.",5,,"Visited gardens by the Bay for the first time and we enjoy Cloud Forest so much, that we able to spent 2 hours in there mostly just sitting down to enjoy the nature. Amazing view.

Will surely go back to visit Cloud Forest and Flower Dome at night.",,
,,Gardens,5,,Great place to visit. Stay for the sunset/night time view as well. Can spend at least 3/4 hrs walking around. Is outside so can be humid and if the wind blows can be cold. Food court nearby for lunch/dinner can be busy.,,
,,interesting place,4,,stunning location and artificial gardens that are being built .Suitable even for people that are not botanical nuts,,
,,"The best of Singapore's style, imagination and dedication to the flower world",5,,"Real yet fantasy, a true flower eye-feast...if u want to spend an hot Singapore afternoon inside a cool beautiful place, this is the place to go",,

,,"At Gardens by the Bay (GBB), i fell in love with nature",5,,"So many plants, fresh air, mesmerising beauty, Bees sucking honey from flowers, and colours everywhere, a must see in Singapore.....",,
,,Great place for any age to visit,5,,"Gardens by the bay is a go to day trip location for our family when the weather is dry, its a wonderful oasis in the middle of a busy city. You can truly forget where you are and relax there and even our young children love it. They especially appreciate the two indoor experiences that showcase the rain forest complete with a waterfall and the desert. Those venues host other attractions at christmas too.
There are also good food choices varying from top notch restaurants and bistros to a great local food court (hawker center) and you can easily access the Shoppes @ Marina Bay from the connected walkway. Highly reccommended.",,
,,Beautiful,4,,Beautiful Place. Entry fee can be reduce though. Alot of difference plants and flowers from different parts of the world,,
,,Great experience.,3,,Great experience. The best at night. We took a lovely long walk. A bit pricey but a must do if you are in Singapore,,
,,A must in Singapore,5,,"Spent the morning in and around gardens by the bay with my husband and little boy. We went in both domes, but spent the most time in the cloud dome. My little boy loved the children鈥檚 garden. We ate in the satay garden area. We also went back at night to see the light show which was spectacular. This has got to be a must on any visit to Singapore and allow at least half a day, plus time for the evening light show.",,
,,Coffee Break,5,,You can spend an entire day at the cloud and flower dome. The ambiance and serenity that the attraction gives the guests is fabulous. I spent an entire day at cafe inside the flower dome.,,
,,Educational and relaxing,3,,"There is two domes which are buit on reclaimed land. I was told that the electricity for this entire area also generated through regenerative sources. The cloud dome simulates environment from sea level to mountain level and demonstrates varous plants and tress across various levels of temp and humidity. It is very educational.
the flower dome is seasonal and shows variety of plants and tress from various continents. there is separate price fo locals and tourists. be mindful of closure dates for maintenance. the area is good for a half-a-day tour.",,
,,Back to nature,4,,"Spectacular tourist attraction for all, families, friends and couples to experience the extensive collection of flora and fauna found at various altitudes which one does not get living in Asia. Well worth spending an afternoon here and really wonderful in the evening with the light show.",,
,,"Must see attraction, better at night!",5,,"We visited Gardens by the Bay and it was easily a highlight of our trip. It is such an incredible idea and I've never seen anything like it. It is amazing, free (a rarity in Singapore) and they also have a light show at night.",,
,,Xmas lights,4,,Visited when they had their Xmas special. With all the funfair like that's suitable for kids and adults.,,
,,Well worth a visit,5,,"We visited the Gardens via our Singpore Explorer Pass. We loved it so much, we spent so much time in the Domes that it was raining by the time we wanted to do the actual gardens or the little train tour. Loved the wooden sculptures that they did. Incredible workmanship. I reckon we could have spent a full day here if we took a break for lunch! We wheeled my mum around in a wheelchair provided by them at the info desk.
Will definitely go back when next in Singapore.",,
,,poorly done,2,,"The architecture is great but the overall impression is of incongruous planting , no real theme, and ironically for all the green hype lots of plastic animals and staligmites. I think the plants looked like a poorly run garden centre, bedding plants shoved in amongst other unlikely neighbours. some of the growth was the ivy I have been trying to remove from my own garden.
they need to see the Eden Project in the UK and learn from that.",,
,,"If you're into spectacular gardens, this is the place!",5,,"My wife and I have been to Singapore on a number of occasions, but this was our first visit to Gardens by the Bay. What a spectacle! Brilliantly conceived and executed. You need a lot of energy to try to do the entire place in one day and, as seniors, we ran out of puff. More next visit.

The Gardens have been cleverly segmented into specialised areas, including the spectacular Supertree Grove, which features in all the advertising. The air conditioned Flower Dome is a must-visit feature. It contains plants from many countries and, for the children, features wonderful sculptures of characters from well-known children's literature such as Alice in Wonderland and Winnie the Pooh. There are also carvings from many of the countries whose plants are featured in the dome, including, Timor Leste, Arnhem Land in Australia, and many others.

Another must is the Cloud Forest Conservatory. Simply glorious.

We were accompanied by three teenage boys (12-14 yo) and they, too, loved the place. Now, that's saying something!",,
,,"Beautiful , eco friendly , great place to cycle around",5,,"I did a dawn ride here, and really love this place. At 6am, there were already quite a lot of joggers and cyclists at the Bay, minus the tourist crowds.
The lightings on the buildings were beautiful. At the same time , as you pass the numerous gardens, the trees, aromatic flowers and chirping of birds were delightful.
Just be careful as you walk/cycle past the garden beds, don鈥檛 get caught by the water sprinklers.",,
,,Dahlia Colours,4,,"In preparation for Chinese Lunar New Year, the Flower Dome is exhibiting Dahlia Dreams. Exhibition is very festive and provides good photo opportunities",,
,,Most beautiful place on earth,5,,"Just amazing, not to be missed. We did the cooled flower and cloud domes during the afternoon and then watched the light show early evening. Get there early for a good spot.",,
,,Amazing spectacle!!,5,,"We visited the park in the evening and wished we could have also experienced it during the day, but time did not allow this. The Supertrees were fantastic!! No wonder the traffic was so heavy and taxis were difficult to obtain!!!",,
,,beautiful... and freezing,4,,So many flowers and plants that the smell hits the face when you enter. It was so hot and humid outside and SO cold inside that we left a little bit earlier because it ended up being freezing.,,
,,Worth one time visit,3,,We enjoyed & celebrated Christmas. Very nice only thing is restaurant is very small and not very cozy.,,
,,Cloud Forest Excellent - visited by day and night,5,,"Cloud Garden was Excellent we were in there for the misting which gave some good pics. Spent time in the gardens. A couple of days latter we visited in the evening for the SuperTree light / sound show - that was very good, the main gardens were very different in the evening worth the 2 visits.",,
,,Beautiful place at night,5,,Came here just before dusk. Walking through the area in the dark had a magical feeling to it. Beautiful lights and great athmosphere. The gardens are easy to reach by public transport.,,
,,Loved it all!,5,,This place is great. We paid a bit extra to do the skywalk which was incredible. The surrounding garden areas are really nice too but we couldn't do too much as it was very hot with few places for shade.,,
,,Highlight of my trip,5,,"A great place with a lot of offer! I recommend a late afternoon/evening visit, because a) it鈥檚 starting to cool down a bit and b) the gardens look beautiful lit up at night - particularly the Supertree light show. However this does seem to be when it鈥檚 busiest. I loved the cloud forest and flower garden - both totally worth paying for in my opinion. Also loved the sun pavilion. For eating - they are plenty of options but most of them are fairly expensive by Singapore standards. I recommend the satay by the bay hawker Center for local food that is a bit more reasonably priced (but still expensive compared to other hawker centres)",,
,,Perfect gardens,5,,"Very nice place to visit. As it is in Singapore, the only bad is that is too hot. Even January is too hot. How ever is a great place to visit.",,
,,Such an Amazing Garden,5,,"What a fantastic place for anyone to experience and appreciate. I went to the gardens during the day with my husband, sister and her husband, as well as my brother and his family. We all thoroughly enjoyed the visit, kids and adults alike. Access to the gardens is free, with a fee for entry to the flower and cloud gardens....both well worth the visit. Beautifully presented oasis's from the heat of the day. And then we went back the next night to experience the brilliant light show. No wonder this is Singapore's No #1 attraction. If I go back to Singapore I will definitely visit again to wander the parts of the gardens that I didn't see this trip.",,
,,Wow!,4,,It鈥檚 composed of 2 airconditioned domes connected by walkways. Giant 鈥渇lower trees鈥?are also an attraction. Wear comfortable clothes and shoes and be prepared for a long walk and enjoy the various floral and non-floral plants in the domes. Difficult to get a good shot at the waterfalls because of many tourist also taking pictures. Failed to see the light show because I just enjoyed our dinner in one of the many restaurants around the giant flower trees and rested my aching feet (wore footwear not conducive to long walks).,,
,,Stunning,5,,"A must if you visit Singapore absolutely stunning place, plenty of water stations to fill up and lots of things to see! Would recommend you allow 4-5 hours to have a good look around!",,
,,Amazing centre,5,,Was amazing inside the 2 domes. Worth a visit especially if you are a gardener. We are not but loved to see all the amazing set ups,,
,,Unique view,4,,"This is really the unique place, I have seen in my life. However, there is some improvement require to be done at the drop off point",,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,"This is without doubt one of Singapore鈥檚 best attractions, the flower dome has gardens from around the world and the other, the Cloud Forest, is like stepping onto the film set of Avatar. One cannot leave Singapore without a visit here. One tip, bring a sweater or equivalent as believe it or not it is cooler inside the domes.",,
,,New Garden rates in World Top 10.,5,,"Visited Marina Bay Gardens by both night and day. A spectacular 'must see' and experience , on your visit to Singapore. The Cloud Dome was amazing, and the Sound and Light Show in the evening was 'out of this world!"" Must rate highly as one of the world's most colourful man made gardens.",,
,,garden peace,5,,"this is a must see for people that enjoy gardens and garden sculpture. you can take a path or elevator up to a very high indoor waterfall, with exotic flowers all around. we enjoyed the alice in wonderland sculptures dotted here and there in the interior gardens. the outer area has a very pleasant walk at ground level, and for a fee you can hike above the gardens. there is also a free sky walk out of the park to a shopping center. plenty of food places in these gardens...",,
,,Awesome 馃憦,5,,"Spectacular, never seen anything like it, my adult kids are not easily impressed and this place stopped them in their tracks. Wonderful place to visit, the gardens are so beautiful. Highly recommended.",,
,,Family,5,,Garden by the bay is so beautiful and it鈥檚 everyone must be see whoever comes Singapore. The water falls and greenery with flowers are very nice,,
,,Beautiful place,5,,Gardens by the Bay are beautiful place for a walk. Jungle in the crowded city center. Interesting light show in the evening on the artificial trees. One of the place in Singapore which you definetly must see!,,
,,Marvelous Man Made Miracle.......,5,,"I am flattened with what I saw today, no words to express how happy my kids were after spending half a day over there.
The unique glass structure.
The different species of plants from all around the world.
The highest man made waterfall.
The unique and tall super trees.
The connectivity from Marina bay sands.
The artificial rainforest like atmosphere created by fog.
A short movie played showing the disasters of rising temperature around the world.
The gift shops and fooding joints.
City people come for jogging and cycling at this place.
Entry to glass domes is reasonably charged...around 23 dollars per person.
Suggestions....one of the most reviewed placed in Singapore...a must see.",,
,,What a unique garden,4,,"This is truly a unique and beautiful garden. I would say it is the best in its kind in the world. I'm not surprised that it actually won the best Garden in the world award.

Truly amazing experience and most of all the verity of orchids and the other plants that it holds are amazing. Beautiful flowers blooms all around you and you feel you are actually in heaven.

It's a nice experience to enjoy with your loved ones. I would recommend to purchase the tickets online well before if you are planning a trip. It will give you good discounts.

The garden provides you the tour of shuttle service for few more Singapore dollars which is very much helpful if you are travelling with elderly.

The garden provide you a couple of good restaurants, gift shop and play area for kids and alike.

Overall a must go place when you are in Singapore for all the family to enjoy.",,
,,Great trip,5,,"We came here in the evening to see the trees lit up. The rain forest and waterfall are great. Light show is on twice an evening although the choice of accompanying music is a bite weird. We purchased tickets through Klook which was 5$ cheaper than going direct and was s mobile ticket so no need to queue.

Worth visiting.",,
,,"Beautiful , Amazing introduction to tropical plants",5,,The whole garden should be seen and experienced atleast once by everyone Love that the whole set up is based on sustainability,,
,,Great spot,1,,Thought would be tacky. I was so far off the mark. Great couple of hours. Only issue is the usual problem of lots of people taking pictures of each other and themselves. Not sure if they appreciated the place or whether they were going to enjoy when they got home and looked at the pictures!,,
,,Go to the Light Show,5,,"We went to the 7:45pm light show in supertree grove. It's definitely worth the trip, it's not overly crowded (although it is busy) and it's great to look at.",,
,,Great experience,5,,"Went for the evening light and music show and it was outstanding and unique. A really lovely way to enjoy Singapore and what it has to offer, and very close to the centre of the city with lots of parking, so very easy to get to.",,
,,Really beautiful attraction. Great in the evening,4,,The Gardens by the Bay are gorgeous. I was expecting just to spend a half hour there or so but spent way more time here. A visitor could spend an entire day here. The night shows at 7:45 and 8:45 are incredible.,,
,,Stupendous,5,,"As a Christian, this place definitely displays the Glory of God! It is absolutely beautiful and so cool to see the different plants from different parts of the world!",,
,,Adventure,5,,"Albeit weather unkind, it was an awsome experience and well worth the visit we stayed at hotel next door so could watch illumination from out room also. A stunning place to explore.",,
,,"Amazing gardens, pack a jacket.",4,,Amazing gardens. Missed the light show because we were too. Use enjoy food at Satay by the Bay. Getting home with two tired children is not fun.,,
,,Beautiful gardens on reclaimed land in Singapore.,5,,The outside garden is free but there is a charge for gardens in the domes and the skywalk. (Skywalk is only $1 for those over 60). Beautiful walks with vista around the bay and toward the city.,,
,,Amazing Tulips,5,,"Late review, visited the flower dome on April 2017. Enjoyed the tulips seasonal flowers. Don't need to travel to holland to view the numerous varieties and colours of tulips! The dome is temperature controlled climate, so it might get a bit chilly for those that are used to the scorching hot asian weather. We had an amazing hightea set there too which was good. Only downside was there was no view of the main flower display from the hightea restaurant area.",,
,,Free fun water space n playground,4,,"My boys 10 - 12 year loves the water splash park n great playground with slides at the children's garden. Have loads of fun. Be sure to bring towels and come in bather. There is washroom for kids to rinse. Remember to bring sunblock.
Kids will sure to be there for hours. Is even great for little ones. Good to pack snacks. There is also a Macdonald and cafe nearby.",,
,,More than you can expect,5,,Where to start as this place is simply superb . Its a marvelous architecture and beyond your imagination .Cloud forest and flower dome are must see,,
,,VERY GOOD,4,,It is a really wonderful place to visit but the entry fees is too high and no indian food available though 50% visitors are indians.,,
,,breathtaking gardens,5,,While in singapore my wife and I decided to visit the gardens by the bay . Dont freak at what they charge you just pay and go . From the moment you enter the gardens there are sights and gardens for every body . Probably what will blow you away are the two glasshouses and to call them glasshouses is an understatement well and truly . One glasshouse contains beautiful gardens of flowers and the gardens are divided into countries of the world .Absolutely beautiful .Inside the other is a man made mountain which includes the worlds highest man made waterfall and stunning montain plants of the world . Wear your walking shoes and take your water and maybe a bite to eat as some food outlets can be expensive. Very easy to access using singapores MRT which will get you most places you wish to go quickly and in comfort not to mention cheaply . Go to singapore and enjoy .,,
,,A Highlight,5,,"This is a ""must see"" in Singapore The flower gardens are wonderful, but the large dome with the waterfall is absolutely spectacular. Although I am afraid of heights, the skywalk is well worth the effort. This is undoubtedly the best horticultural display anywhere in the world. Do not miss the light show in the evening. It is truly breathtaking.",,
,,Good attraction,4,,Clean and enjoyable environment. Able to see different types of plants. Highly recommend for visiting!,,
,,Absolutely amazing,5,,"What a beautiful parkland. Singapore really knows how to present gardens for public use. It is hard not to stop being amazed by the way this garden and its features have designed and constructed. The Cloud garden and Flower Garden are features that are stunning!. At night, the place is ablaze with colour and you find yourself grinning from ear to ear in wonder and amazement.",,
,,An amazing place that really justifies it's no.1 spot,5,,"The main part of these gardens are free to wander around during the day and night. Go to the supertree light show at 7:45pm or 8:45pm. It only last 15 mins and has music to it to. Try and watch some of it from the bridge over to the Marina Bay Hotel but also closer to them in the park to.

The other must do thing about these parks are the conservatories. Both the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest are unbelievable and absolutely worth the combined fee of $28. The Cloud Dome is the best and can be seen for $16 (not advertised) if you only have time for 1. Leave at least 45mins but up to 90 mins for each one.",,
,,Amazing!,5,,Both domes and the walk from the top to the bottom is spectacular. We were part of a tour yet this attraction is easily managed solo. Highly recommended,,
,,Beautiful experience,5,,I was Not too sure what to expect before arriving but ended up spending 6 hours at this venue. Two tips I would give anyone visiting. Pay for the admission to the 2 domes. The 2 domes are a jaw dropping experiences and you never stop taking photos and saying WOW. Second tip pay for the guided shuttle it only costs $8 and is a good way to see the rest of the gardens. It doesnt stop though so hard to get any real good photos but we were there for 6 hours and took the shuttle and could of easily stayed there. The only thing you pay for is entrance to the domes S$28 the rest of the gardens are free. Worth a visit,,
,,Beautiful!,5,,This is a large complex where a person could spend all day or just a couple of hours depending on how much you want to take in.. It is beautiful both inside the domes and walking in the open public gardens... I highly recommend visiting here.,,
,,A fabulous floral flight of fancy,5,,"20 years ago, a 3-day stopover in Singapore might have been enough, but these days even a fortnight is not enough. And 'Gardens by the Bay' is definitely one of the newer must-see attractions. The whole area is a delight, but the two massive glass domes make it a good choice for any damper days too. An ever-changing display of flora from around the world, our first visit last August coincided with an orchid extravaganza, then this month there was another feast for the eyes with 'Dahlia Dreams'.",,
,,An absolute MUST when you visit Singapore,5,,"Returning to Singapore after 25 years, my husband and I made a point of visiting sites that had been created since our last visit. We had seen pictures of Gardens by the Bay online but were not prepared for the real thing. They are truly an amazing structure! We spent more than half a day walking through the two domes and looking in awe at the beautiful plants. Neither of us would ever have sought out a garden for a venue to visit - so please don鈥檛 think that you鈥檙e not a 鈥済arden person鈥?so you won鈥檛 enjoy it!! We thoroughly enjoyed the audio commentary and the displays about sustainability too. You will be blown away at the engineering involved as well.",,
,,Magnificent from Garden Domes to Light Show,5,,"Fantastic and the Christmas Spectacular light show was magnificent. The mixture of every race , creed and religion enjoying the light show in tune to Christmas Carols certainly expressed the true meaning of Christmas",,
,,Futuristic,3,,Very interesting. This site has a free part which is also very interesting. You pay for each other part separately. So you can spend a lot of money or nothing. Recommend this for children as well since there鈥檚 plenty of areas to run and play. I only visited the rain forest which was nice,,
,,Beautiful light show,5,,"Definitely worth seeing - a light show set to a great soundtrack, one of the highlights of my visit to Singapore. It was very busy with a lot of people so I recommend getting a great spot to watch the show.",,
,,Must See,5,,Really there are not much places where you can find the nature amidst artificial amenities. The cloud forest is the best thing here. And obviously don't miss the light show with music at 7:45 and 8:45 pm.,,
,,An Artificially Natural Masterpiece,5,,"The Supertree structures are a genius piece of architecture amongst the greenery of the park. Although the park is free, it鈥檚 worth paying to walk along the Skyway for a great view of the bay. The evening Christmas light show was the cherry on the cake. A brilliant place to visit!",,
,,Pleasant,3,,Didn't have loads of time so walked though the Flower Dome. Pleasant time. Everything well labeled. If you are in to plants this is the place to be.,,
,,"If I loved it, anyone would",5,,"I get extremely bored at the usual tourist attractions after a while, but I can honestly that the gardens by the bay is absolutely fantastic and has something for everyone.
I visited in November when they just preparing the finishing touches for the xmas theme. Even though, granted, I wasn't one to look through every flower and where it came from, but from a picture opportunity perspective, it really was very entertaining.

I spent a good 2/3 hours there and I literally just walk around and carry on. If you visit Singapore, you should definitely put this into your itinerary.",,
,,Amazaing man made beauty,5,,"It was so lovely and refreshing. What an amazing time I had that morning. At first we had a tour around the whole park. then went to check gardens inside the halls. Literally, it was like walking in a wonderland.
Every bit was taken care of very well. The colours of the plants, and how they were displayed was something incredible. So many rare flowers and various plants from all around the world.
Not to be missed while in Singapore.
It was a satisfying experience, hopefully I can visit again.",,
,,Amazing exhibits,5,,The gardens by the bay are an extensive area with many different garden exhibits. There are two domes (entrance fee) one majoring on flowers and the other on a forest and waterfall theme. You would need to spend at least half a day to see all that is on offer,,
,,Lovely day out!,5,,Highly recommend a visit to Gardens By The Bay - particularly the Cloud Garden on a hot Singapore afternoon. These amazing structures are cooled inside so you can wander around and take in the absolutely amazing sights in complete comfort. It really is quite special what they have done here. Bring swimmers too as there is a great fountain/pool for kids!!,,
,,Gardens by the Bay Beautiful,5,,"This is a must see, wow. Don't miss this. So many beautiful areas to see. I would go back here for sure. Took tons of pictures",,
,,This place is a MUST VISIT one,5,,"Amazing gardens, with very diverse plants, sophisticated design, and technology. There are very few places in the world, if any, that could match this one.",,
,,Like heaven,5,,So so beautiful and clean with awesome scenery one of the best places in Singapore that must visit .you can walk for hours besides the shore and enjoy the beautiful weather and garden,,
,,Bay of delights!!!,5,,Wonderful venue - great scenery - quiet and relaxing. Lovely structures - great family time out and can easily spend a few hours here. I walked on the bridge that connected some of the structure which cost $8 each person and was worth it! Definitely a must if in the area.,,
,,"Amazing, read tips below to find out more",5,,"Beautiful gardens, blooming orchids, flowering trees. An awe-mazing garden. This attraction does not come without prices. Prices for either Cloud Dome, Flower Dome or both. This place has two indoor green house domes, with cool air so you can relax in there even with hot weather, bring a jacket. It is worth the price, maybe pay at least for one dome. (There is a skywalk inside). Then there is the skywalk outside, if you have seen a picture of Garden by the Bay you will see the purple tree like structures. There is a skywalk attached to two of them and you can pay a few dollars to walk! The view is spectacular.

If you'd prefer to not pay you can walk the outdoor gardens.",,
,,Lovely garden with amazing workmanship.,4,,"The is an unusual garden, unlike others, it have a beautiful garden inside a shelter glass architecture, and you won't feel hot like outside, and yet walk gracefully walking without felling the hot sun. If you are not here before, do come, and you will definitely experience a very different garden....",,
,,"Do not miss this wonder in Singapore-plus, it's FREE",5,,"This is one of those iconic items. A Singapore gem. I would come here just to see this in person alone. It is truly, truly awe inspiring. They should be charging $20 to get in, but they only charge for certain exhibits. What a gift to all those who wander in. DO NOT MISS THIS! Better than the botanic garden!",,
,,Excellent as usual!,5,,"It was our second visit,this time only to the Flower Dome to see the Poinsettia/Christmas exhibits plus Northern Lights projection",,
,,Gorgeous,5,,What an amazing place to visit. So clean and tidy. Beautifuly laid out with lots to see and do. The evening light show is well worth seeing. Go to the top of the tree for a drink and amazing views. It is $20 (拢10 ish) with a free glass of wine. It is well worth it.,,
,,One day isn't enough to finish,4,,"It was huge! we went to 2 attractions and there were a lot of people. Although i find it a bit simple because the plants in there were often seen where I came from. However, the place is surely huge. One day is not enough to finish all the places. It's refreshing to see plus the view at top is amazing. I would be going back here probably but will visit another attraction.",,
,,Amazing gardens!,5,,Such a wonderful place to visit with many amazing displays and plants to explore and admire. Close to an MRT and lots to see and do. Make sure you have lots of time to enjoy the beauty of the park.,,
,,If you like gardens this is the place to visit,5,,This is the most amazing place to visit for anyone that enjoys gardens. It is too amazing for words really but suffice to say it is absolutely well worth a visit. Not just the huge conservatories but also the grounds and the enormous Supertree Grove. Take a guided tour on a golf buggy for very little money if it is too hot to walk.,,
,,Gorgeous,4,,This is worth visiting if you are visiting Singapore. It is gorgeous. You can also go the flower dome and cloud dome which are worth going in they are lovely and also educational. (You have to pay for them but is worth it),,
,,Nice place to visit.,5,,Excellent location. Would recommend tovisit in night to enjoy light show in evening. Carry lots of water due to high humidity.,,
,,great garden to visit,5,,There is alot of interesting plants and laid out nicely for visitors. The structure is one of a kind experience to see.,,
,,Walked through them at night,4,,"We walked through the gardens at night on day one of our visit to Singapore which is just as well as it was hot and humid most of the time we were here
There is enough to see to enjoy the gardens at night too but for those who really want to see the plants they would have to bear the heat and humidity of day time",,
,,Amazing gardens,5,,"Unfortunately was raining when we got there, not much shelter. A lot to walk, but beautiful place, very impressed by the architecture and landscape",,
,,A wonderful experience.,4,,The range of displays and uniqueness of the attractions were highly commendable. The overall experience was highly enjoyable and satisfying.,,
,,Wow!,5,,"Singapore best attractions. You can do in oine day Marina Bay, Merlin, Gardens by the Bay, only to start early in the morning. Nice views!",,
,,Outstanding!,5,,"If you love plants and architecture or want some peace, visit the gardens. An incredible achievement in every regard.",,
,,Withering flowers in Flower Dome,2,,"I was there on the 13/1/18 and it was my 2nd trip. Unlike the first trip that left me wanting to visit again, it was so disappointing to see withering flowers in Flower Dome. Cloud Forest is as impressive though.",,
,,Unique Experience,5,,"I went twice. Once on a tour to see the nighttime light show (beautiful) and then back during the day to see the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. I almost skipped the Flower Dome based on other reviews, and I'm so glad I didn't. The Cloud Forest is interesting, but I actually enjoyed all the flowers in the Flower Dome more. Don't worry if you are afraid of heights, the walkways in the Cloud Forest are wide with waist high railings, so I didn't have any problem at all. I wish I had allowed more time just to walk around the grounds as there was plenty to see that I didn't have time for as I had to get back for an afternoon tea. All in all, I would say this is a must see experience.",,
,,The Most Amazing Place!,5,,"An extremely amazing place just a walk away from Bayfront MRT. An excellently huge complex with lots of plants and domes especially the impressive man-made Supertree Groves! Pay SGD8 for adult to walk its skybridge between the supertree groves. The best thing about this place is it's free of charge just to walk around and a few times at night (maybe twice per night), there's a light show called Garden Rhapsody. Highly recommended and extremely beautiful!",,
,,Stupendous!,5,,"Its like a scene from Avatar

Go in the late afternoon and then you can see the segue into evening and night- which is when you get the most amazing light in the sky + the gardens start to light up. there is a sound and light show on the hour and it gets pretty crowded so get there and grab a seat in the open plan area

there are loads of small quiet walkways and surprise seating areas...",,
,,Garden within the City ..,5,,Not to be missed at all .. It is one of the most beautiful attractions of Singapore .. You Gotta buy tickets .. It is opposite to the Marna Bay and a must visit for locals as well as tourists ..,,
,,"A singapore 'must do""",5,,"An extremely good venue - two separate domes the rainforest and the flower domes each fully enclosed. The entrance to the rainforest dome us a wow as you are presented with the highest man made waterfall in the world. Wander through the various areas even stalactites and stalagmites and go up to the top then amble down the walkway offering fantastic views. I understand that the displays have been overseen by a former Kew Gardens expert - a fantastic result. We thought the flower dome was not so awe inspiring but in fairness there was a note apologising for fact changes were being made to the displays , however still a not to be missed visit. We had intended to spend time in the vast outside grounds but unfortunately the weather changed with tropical downpours so cannot comment on them.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is a beautiful oasis in Dungapore. It is clean, beautifully maintained and a feast for the eyes.",,
,,Worth the visit,4,,"This place was amazing and worth the visit, very crowded but worth the time and walking. Definitely a must see.",,
,,Worth the visit,4,,"This place was amazing and worth the visit, very crowded but worth the time and walking. Definitely a must see.",,
,,Must Visit in SIngapore,5,,"The best time to visit Gardens by the Bay is noo. Because that is the time when the temperatures are at day's high and you can enjoy the cool misty breeze inside the cloud forest. The mist spray is on for 20minutes. It is the best place to visit with family and small children where they can see something unique.

I liked flower dome and cloud forest the most.

If possible, get the tickets beforehand to save you time by standing in long queue.",,
,,"Gardens by the Bay, Singapore.",4,,"These beautiful gardens, close to Marina Bay, are free to enter. One only pays if one wishes to go into the domes, which cost $23, but are well wothwhile if you like trees and plants in a humid atmosphere. There are several restaurants serving a reasonable selection of food and beverages at acceptable prices. The views across the Bay from the Gardens, are stunning.",,
,,Worthy to be #1 in TA,5,,"There are different types of attractions within it, and please dont miss any of them. This is not just a mere garden, be there and you will realise how mesmerizingly beautiful the whole setup is. Spend a whole afternoon here.",,
,,Great day out,4,,This place is big on wow factor - extraordinary plants - brilliantly displayed. Everything about it is expertly done - you can't fault it. Bring your whole family.,,
,,Excellent Enclosed Areas - Average Cafes,4,,"The enclosed rain forest area was superb and very cleverly done. The explanations of the Super Trees and other parts of the park were intriguing, although you had to know where to look to find them.
Some of the cafes were not that good in quality, but we managed to find one that gave an OK coffee and toasted sandwich!
Definitely should be on the Singapore bucket list.",,
,,Stunning Gardens,5,,This is a must see attractions for anybody interested in gardens. It is done beautifully and with style.,,
,,Nice tropical garden,5,,"We are from tropical country, and used to see green environment, but this place amaze us by how well they take care of the plant and the area.",,
,,My personal fave in Singapore,5,,"Excellent and thoughtful attraction! The two domes are beautiful, and we were there at Christmas, which makes them even more beautiful. The supertree is also a blast. Probably my personal fave attraction in Singapore!",,
,,Great experience,5,,"Went with family and visited the Gardens, Flower Dome and the Cloud Done. Really a must do. But if I was pushed for time the Cloud Dome is a Gem and should be on everyone's list.",,
,,Pay extra for the Dome and other experiences,5,,"I usually try to give lots of details to help travelers, but it's not necessary here. I read the 4-5 previous reviews and they used all of the superlatives that I would have used. It is a MUST-SEE in Singapore. Not just your typical ""gardens"". Spend the day and night here. Unbelievable on all accounts. The five year old thought it was ""very cool"". LOCAL seniors receive a discount, but that was pretty on par for the rest of Singapore's attractions. The only disappointing place was the food court. Very mediocre food, and you had to go into different entrances to get different types of food and pay separately. Not easy for a family to get different things and sit together.",,
,,The prettiest garden in SEA!,5,,"No doubt you鈥檒l amaze with the beauty and the variety of plants and flowers presented here. The cloud forest that show us the beauty of architecture combine with the great nature, the height and the proportion made us feel so amazed and feel humble below the nature.
This place is very recommended for them who wants to know more about variety of plants and flowers and spend time here while learn about the solar energy, and what human has done to earth, the effect in a long term journey of life!",,
,,Beautiful,5,,I was skeptical when my boyfriend said he would like to visit 'some' gardens but they where so beautiful. I'd definitely recommend going after sun set as everything is lit up and it's just magical.,,
,,Beauty in the rain,5,,"Not everyone's cup of tea because it is a bit manufactured (I think built on reclaimed land), but I wandered entranced in the rain that tends to arrive in the afternoon in Singapore's wet season. So much to see and enjoy. If you like plants and trees you should go.",,
,,Great Stopover Place,4,,"We had a stopover there for 5 days. We visited the Flower Dome and it was a nice day. Beautiful flowers there too. The Cloud Dome was bit cold, but it was a wonderful experience. Had lot's of fun there!!!",,
,,Bay fantastic,5,,A must see. Amazing views of Singapore. Views of the bay and city sky line. As well as the amazing gardens and waterfalls.,,
,,Nice and beautiful,4,,"It is a big place, of course, and I enjoyed fully the green in Garden by the bay. You could walk around here or take a express service to sightseeing.",,
,,Amazing Garden!!!,5,,"This place was absolutly amazing!! I love it very much! Very spacious with sometype of garden you could enjoy. The garden was free entry. But if you want to visit domes, skywalk, or ride a shuttle you need to pay for the entry. I visited ocbc skyway, forest dome and cloud dome. You would get different experiences in each domes. So make sure you visit them when you come in here. But if you are on budget, you could just walk around the garden. It's free. This place is a must visit on Singapore. I want to come this place again and spending all my day in here. Can't get enough!",,
,,Garden by the Bay...Man made!!,4,,"Well designed and beautifully grown garden with variety of plants & flowers including carnivorous!
Senior citizen and wheel chair personnel friendly ,multi storey gardens ofinternationally famous plants are grown through moisture from clouds created.

Wheel chairs are available but charged.This should be made cost free and extended right up to the entrance/exit.
Where to start and how to go about shall be explained to all visitors in groups.Staff at the information do not provide adequate guidance and take care of all visitors and should be more visitor friendly.
Staff manning the lifts are more friendlier than staff at the information centre.

Well self explained displays on formation of clouds, icicles etc.",,
,,An amazing way to spend a day,5,,"We only had one full day in Singapore and we knew we wanted to spend a good chuck of time in Gardens By the Bay. We arrived late morning and walked around the outside gardens first, these are free to visit. The outside spaces were surprisingly quiet, I don't know if that's just the time we visited or if most of the visitors are concentrated in the domes.
We also visited both domes which are incredible, I was so impressed not just by what there was to see but also the information provided about how GBTB are working to be as sustainable as possible.
The Supertrees are really a sight to see, we did the walk which was really good as you get a nice perspective over the rest of the gardens.
We also came back in the evening for the lights show, as we visited in December Supertree Grove was inside the winter wonderland attraction they had, so we had to pay to enter which was a bit annoying but to be honest I would pay to watch the light show on a regular month anyway, so we just viewed it like we were paying for that. The show was really wonderful, finished off with a snow machine!",,
,,Beautiful gardens day or night,4,,"We went to the gardens in the evening and went to the bar at the top of the tree which was great fun, you had a 360 degree view from there which was fab",,
,,Must See,5,,"Make sure that you are there for the light show, you will need plenty of time to walk around this is an amazing place",,
,,Enjoyable,4,,"Very nice activity, relax and enjoy the nature. Perfect for a sunny or not raining day. A must when you visit Singapore",,
,,Beautiful & Educational,5,,"This was AMAZING! It's educational, pretty, fun and very easy to spend the whole day there. It's so humbling to see a wealthy city invest into the well-being of the future. I also really liked that it was free to enter most, other than the domes, which means that it is accessible to all! We did visit the cloud dome and it was incredible.
I would recommend this to all",,
,,The best money you鈥檒l ever spend,5,,"WOW is about all I can say. We visited the Flower Dome and were extremely impressed but then the Cloud Forest took things to a whole new level. Just when you鈥檇 thought you鈥檇 seen it all, around another corner was another amazing display. We honestly can鈥檛 speak highly enough of the effort put into developing and maintaining these Gardens. Nothing disappointed including the super-tree nighttime light show. Give yourself the day to enjoy the true magnificence of this whole place.",,
,,Lovely place for relaxing walk.,5,,"Breathtaking landscaping. you can really enjoy the environment while having a relaxing walk. Don't forget to experience delicious food from ""satay by the bay"".",,
,,"Really worth it, affordable for Singapore",5,,"A must see, quite affordable for Singapore attractions. The giant trees were spectacular. The variety of trees,flowers was also impressive. There was also a man-made waterfall that was a must-see. Close to Marina Bay. Perfectly located for supper/drinks after the day.",,
,,"Magical, Singapore must do!",5,,"A Singapore highlight! The gardens are so majestic, with a large variety appealing to all people. Of a night it changes completely and only becomes better. Try to complete the skywalk during one of the light shows it was the most beautiful part of the evening that cannot be explained, only experienced.",,
,,Interesting but not exciting with teens.,3,,"We did both the cloud dome and flower dome with teen kids and it was very awe inspiring to see the money that has been spent but if you are 45 and under I wouldn't be upset if you missed it.
I have tried to add photos but I have IT issues.",,
,,rookie error by visiting on christmas eve,4,,"This place is stunning, however we made the mistake of visiting on christmas eve so I would not suggest you visit on any special days. We seemed to just wait in line all the time to see something or do something. Would love to see this place when it is not so over crowded.",,
,,Interesting place,4,,"It's located next to downtown. Very nicely built. There are 2 dome built with fully aircon. One filled with many flowers & the other one has a few stories of waterfall. Outside domes, there are ""giant trees"" made of huge structure. Definitely must visit if you come to Singapore.",,
,,Nice place to visit,5,,We visited Gardens by the bay on our first day in Singapore. Try to reach the place at between 5-6 PM so that you will be able to see it during both daylight and at night. The place is awesome. The domes are huge and well planned. I enjoyed the Cloud forest dome more than the flower dome. The supertrees are wonderful. This is a must visit place.,,
,,Amazing. Easy to visit during a same day stopover.,5,,"Had 12 hours between Singapore airport flights so we grabbed an easy 20 min taxi to Gardens by the Bay and wow, we were so glad we did. The place is amazing!
The Flower Dome was good, the Cloud Forest even better, and the Skyway through the Supertrees was super.
Suits all ages (ours 11-adult) and we spent a worthwhile 6hrs there.
The Marina Bay Sands Hotel is a short 10min walk away if you wish to view too.
If you need a minivan taxi you'll need to use a taxi ride app as just taxi sedans seem to pull up on the cab rank.",,
,,A great way to spend a day in Singapore,4,,"We wanted to hike, but instead went here. We definitely got in our hike, then some. WELL worth it. Beautiful plants and scenery. I recommend spending 3 or 4 hours here.",,
,,Worth it,5,,"I only had a day in Singapore and I鈥檓 happy I鈥檝e chosen the gardens to spend it at.
I鈥檝e called an Uber and once there purchases the $8 audiotour around the gardens, very interesting
Also $14 to see the cloud forest (definitely worth the visit) unluckily the flower area was closed for renovations.
I spent about 3 hours around and then ate at the restaurant on top of the giant tree (not so worth the price).
Recommended half day, I wouldn鈥檛 suggest pay for a ticket before actually getting there.",,
,,Gardens Worth Every Penny,5,,"Run, don't walk. You may think you've visited arboretums before, but nothing like this. The park itself is well worth a visit with its futuristic tree sculptures which light up at night and the displays in both domes are spectacular, one with many desert plants and the largest baobab trees you'll ever see outside of Africa; but also seasonal floral displays, an ever changing array of colours and scents. We took photo after photo. The second dome features a five storey high cloud forest, a waterfall cascading down from the top and a grillwork catwalk you walk round and round on as if climbing a mountain, amazing displays of orchids, bromeliads, ferns and multi-coloured leafy tropical plants. Who ever said leaves are boring? Give yourself several hours to visit both the domes and gardens. They'll linger in your memory. User friendly",,
,,In the Garden,5,,"An excellent and unbelievable experience not to be missed, the tree walk giving fantastic views over the entire gardens and beyond, the cloud forest is a magical experience of walking in the clouds over the tree tops and a magnificent feat of engineering.10/10.",,
,,Outstanding Park & Views,5,,This place was an absolute delight. So much better than expected. We spent most of the day here and therefore got to see the tree sculptures in sunshine then beautifully lit up at night. The tree sculptures are something else! Green foliage & creepers have covered the steel sculptures and exotic birds nest and feed in amongst them. Absolutely wonderful. Unsurprising when I saw later on TV that Singapore has more species of animals & plants than any other city in the world. I was speechless after spending the day here. Came away feeling that Singapore was about the best city I鈥檝e ever visited. Awesome!,,
,,Educational and impressive,5,,Well worth a trip. Do the audiotour. Indochine restaurant was underwhelming. Unable to use the Skyway due to lightning threat.,,
,,Nice escape from the city in the city,5,,"Gardens by the bay exceeded our expections. It was very well made, maintained, and really clean. It was fairly priced and was large enough for us to spend about 4 hours here and could have probably stayed longer. There was a great exhibit about the damages humans are doing to the environment and how to keep it preserved for future generations",,
,,Beautiful with well planning,4,,"Heard about this and saw mainly on FB photos, but after am here was amaze with the garden they created in a concrete city which no wonder all tourists wants to be here.
By the way, my view was only walking around as I was late and all ticketing counter was close for the other gardens.
But do be impressed by what they have done....",,
,,Heavenly Nature,5,,"Gardens by the bay is a nature park spanning 250acres of reclaimed land in the central singapore , adjacent to Marina Reservoir #throwback #singaporediary #traveldiary2017",,
,,Great place to walk around,5,,"The Gardens were right by our hotel (the Ritz) and we went there several times, great place to walk, super clean, and the grounds are really spectatcular. Don't miss Satay by the Bay for great Hawker food!",,
,,Brilliant place,5,,"This is a very good place for anytime of the day, very nice at night with all the lights and the music. This is a must see place in Singapore. Domes not something extraordinary, but if you like flowers and plants, then it鈥檚 worth it",,
,,Beautiful gardens,5,,We really enjoyed the gardens and the skywalk. We liked it so much that we came back to visit at night time after spending an afternoon there. It's very beautiful. Definitely recommend for everyone to visit here.,,
,,Amazing man made structures!,5,,If you're in Singapore you have to see these. Try to see during the week if at all possible. Very busy on the weekends. Nighttime would be best!,,
,,Great Tourist Walk,5,,"My family and I enjoyed our Marina Bay Sands hotel rooms view of the gardens. Later, during our visit, we toured for gardens and enjoyed our walk. The gardens are so pretty. A must see.",,
,,"Clever, interesting and well worth doing",5,,A fascinating idea which has worked really well - a man made garden complete with massive metal trees and a five story waterfall - we simply loved it!,,
,,Order full way to spend a day!,5,,Singapore can be a rainy city and the gardens are a great way to spend a day... there's 2 large indoor (and air condition) atriums... buy the tix with a package to save a few bucks...,,
,,Nice garden with an easy access,4,,"The entrance is free but high fees for everything else. It is not nice that they charge twice more for foreigners. The restaurants in the garden are overpriced. But the garden is nice, we enjoyed the walks. But Singapore is hot and humid so you need to dress accordingly and bring water.",,
,,Nice experience,4,,"Worth visiting even though parts of it was closed due to rain. Only thing which was a little strange was the combination of natural settings combined with glass sculptures, LEGO flowers etc.",,
,,Lovely place,3,,We headed to Gardens by the Bay when they has their Christmas Wonderland event in which meant that we had to pay to go in. It is lovely and well worth going. Be mindful that the sky walk will close if it is raining.,,
,,Definitely worth a visit,5,,"OK, I am not a flower or tree lover but decided to visit this park with my family & was truly blown away by these two mammoth glass houses being the Flower Dome and Cloud Dome. The variety of plants/flowers in each dome is outstanding. There is a fair bit of walking involved which I had no issue with.

There are cafes and drink stalls as well as the obligatory souvenir shop with all the goods you want. My recommendation is to go late afternoon and be finished in the domes near 7.45pm when they have a light show at the Supertree Grove. It is worth a look.

Also walk around the park and check out the big baby statue...it is pretty amazing.

The MRT will get you to this location - Bayfront Station.

Last thing, buy tickets for this attraction from klook.com - you will save money on the domes as there is an entry fee. The park itself is free. There are extras you can take part in...treetop walk etc but having done the cable cars (near Sentosa) I really don't think the height sensation compares so we didn't bother.",,
,,Very enjoyable,4,,"I thoroughly enjoyed Gardens by the Bay which is a big thing for me to see considering I'm not usually one for flowers. The OCBC Skyway is a great way to see the surrounding gardens from above, it costs $8 but to me it was worth the cost. There were no lines to get into either of the domes when we went in the morning and were not too crowded you could still get around easily. The flower dome is split into different areas each showing the native plants to that area. The cloud forest was a highlight for me with a running waterfall it was a beautiful sight. There is a light show at the end of the day which was good, however, I found it quite repetitive.",,
,,Beautiful garden,5,,"Where is no many places for tourists in Singapore, but Garden by the bay in one of recommended ! Beautiful waterfall, many flowers and trees. My trip was amazing!",,
,,Best Garden,5,,Lovely gardens a lot of flower varieties..Awsome gardens and the Best in the world.very nice garden and very relaxing,,
,,Nature under man's care,5,,"If you need to see how technology is used to bring nature's beauty to the city neighbourhood this is the place to go. It's a riot of colours from the beginning to the end Breathtakingly fresh and imaginatively laid out you get tge wirth fir the money and time spend.
NOT POSTING ANY PICTURES AS IT WILL BE A DISSERVICE TO THE WORK THERE",,
,,Fantastic,5,,Excellent gardens. Flower dome and cloud dome are amazing as are the gardens outside. Calm and relaxing. Tree light show is amazing too! Definitely worth coming to Singapore to see this! Transportation very easy. Went by metro from mandarin marina hotel and so easy to get to. Would definitely go back!,,
,,Gardens in the Dome Spectactular,5,,Worth the visit spectacular. Might be worthwhile to bring a light weigh jacket because one of the dome was pretty cool/cold but it didn't bother us and did to some we know had to walk out because it was too cold for them.. just a little tip/advice...,,
,,Amazing attraction,4,,Unfortunately we only managed a very short visit as our tour was running late. It merely wheted our appetite. What I can say is I ever return I will definitely revisit and spend much more time here.,,
,,Day trip,5,,"As part of our far eastern travels, we visited the gardens by the bay after watching a program on tv. It's truly amazing here. The cloud walk is pretty cool and has some beautiful flowers inside. Me and my brother enjoyed the refreshing splash from the waterfall. 100% worth a visit if you're in Singapore.",,
,,Air conditioned Glass domes with every possible plant in them.,5,,"The best ever Botanical garden Theme, great wood sculptures , plants that you will never see or heard of, and all in a air condition environment.",,
,,A must-visit attraction,5,,"When we were planning our trip to Singapore friends told us that we must visit the Gardens by the bay, even if that was the only thing we had time for. They were absolutely right, this is an amazing place. Lots to see if you have the time, if you are rushed then the cloud forest dome and the super trees at sundown are the best bits.",,
,,Peaceful day.,4,,"Gardens by the Bay is best visited in the evening when all the trees are lite up, and maybe not in monsoon season like we did.",,
,,A beautiful gem in a glorious setting.,5,,"The gardens are incredible, and the architecture of this glass structure is a real spectacle. There is so much variety to the Gardens, with amazing paths, waterfall, incredible views, smells and beauty.
Really amazes the senses, its an amazing place to visit.
Will definitely remember and recommend!",,
,,Eye Candy,5,,"This place is my top choice to visit in Singapore. I love both domes! But if you must choose one, I recommend Cloud Forest! Aside from that, there are also the Super Trees, which are perfect for sight-seeing and selfies! It was Moon Cake Festival when I visited for the second time, and there were so much to see! There鈥檚 a free show at night to watch under the Super Tree Groove, beautifully decorated lanterns in every garden, booths, and food stalls! But even if you visit without any occasion, you will still enjoy to the fullest!",,
,,Fantastic & Amazing!,5,,"When I stepped into the flower dome my first words were ""wow"". Such a lovely experience of walking amidst the gardens in the dome. We came at night and while we enjoyed it and got a lot out of the visit, think that visiting this place during the day would be much more worth because you can see the colours a lot better and photo taking will also be better. If you don't wish to pay admission, just walking around the area and surrounds outside is also beautiful. There was a light show at 8:45pm which was lovely. One benefit to visiting at night was that crowds were considerably less and you could enjoy strolling through the gardens in a leisurely and relaxed pace.",,
,,Interesting Gardens,4,,"The gardens had lots of Christmas trees/decorations and looked lovely. We enjoyed walking around the lakes, looking at beautiful flowers and trees. We didn't go into the ""houses"" as the park was very busy. Later the artificial trees were lit up and we watched a sound and light show.",,
,,Incredible!,5,,One of the better modern-constructed tourist site outings I've had. The Cloud Forest was a personal favorite but the entire site is breathtaking. Highest recommendations.,,
,,Excellent tour,5,,"This was a great tour. Dinner at the gardens was great as it would have been along time between meals if we had only done the satay tasting at the end of the tour. the tour was made even better by our tour guide Linda Chan. She was informative, interactive and funny with a great sense of humor. thank you Linda",,
,,Best Place in Singapore,5,,Closer to modern city hub this is the ideal place to relax with wonders of nature.... Specially go there at dawn (Not too dark) which will be a mesmerizing experience. But you must be ready to walk until your legs cant feel anything. :D If not can take bicycles.,,
,,Absolutely Worthwlie Visiting,5,,Came here today on the spur of the moments and found out this place was fantastic. Beautiful manicured gardens with large decorated ponds and rock features. Good for a romantic walk in the evening and also a place whereby one could exercise. Words fail me. Come see it for yourself.,,
,,Lovely experience,5,,We spent half a day enjoying the flower dome and cloud forest. It is a not to be missed experience as the gardens are gorgeous and the cloud forest is so different with its huge waterfall. The weather was inclement so we were not able to enjoy the tree garden this time.,,
,,Good park but don鈥檛 miss the twin gems,4,,"Gardens by the bay is a park not a botanical garden even though parts of it aspire to that. If this is what you want head the botanical gardens near the top of Orchard Rd or the national orchid garden.

The two things you mustn鈥檛 miss are the flower dome and the cloud forest.

We were also here for the Christmas wonderland which had some pretty lights but was very crowded and hot and any rides for the kids were completely unreasonable.",,
,,Amazing can鈥檛 wait to go back !,5,,"It was my 3rd time in Singapore , but first time at the gardens . What an amazing place , almost out of this world ! Recommend to go late afternoon so once you finish it will be almost dark and you can watch the light show at the Super Trees , which is totally worth it !",,
,,An interesting and beautiful addition to Singapore,5,,"We visited both domes and enjoyed the diversity in both.

We walked across the Helix Bridge from nearby Hotel and the walk is easy and the bridge a very interesting design. A thrilling aside to this is on the walk back, we heard and then saw, a large otter swimming under the bridge! A local lady told us there was a family of otters who often rested against the other bank, but we did not see them.

The cloud forest is very impressive and the peaceful nature of such a forest in nature is well captured.

We also loved the various pieces of unusual sculpture cunningly placed among the plants in the first part of the exhibit.",,
,,Cloud Forest was amazing,5,,"One of the best things to see in Singapore

You have a choice for Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. If you cant do both, do Cloud Forest

Amazing waterfall ,

flowers a beautiful

You go up a lift and walk down passing the amazing thing structure with all the plants that Singapore has made",,
,,Great experience.,5,,Good for adults and kids alike.Interesting from a botanical perspective as also from a design and architectural perspective.,,
,,Best way to enjoy,5,,"Go in the evening, after dinner for a nice walk. While most people start their tour from the beautiful Marina Bay Sands hotel and walk back, I suggest a taxi or Urber ride get drop off at the Garden taxi stand and walk your way BACK toward the Sands. This way you can avoid crowd better and enjoy better route with shorter walk, especially if you have kids or prefer less walk.",,
,,Love it,5,,"The gardens by the bay are fantastic i love the park it鈥檚 free entry i always go jogging there when i stay in Singapore.
If you want to visit the cloud forest and the flower garden you can buy tickets there i think the prices are very good.
Trie the skywalk which is fantastic after 7 p.m the lights and the view on the hotel marina bay is lovely.",,
,,Christmas wonderland,3,,nice to bring kids out for sightseeing at the night. the only downfall is that there isnt much seating area.,,
,,There's nothing like it!,5,,"I give this place full mark for its originality and that it's courageous to spend so much money upfront to create a tourist attraction that may or may not work. Thankfully, it works and this place deserves to be visited once in a lifetime. That being said, the place upsells everything and the local authority charges like a bull. For you to be shuttled to the main entrance of the garden, you will need to cough up an additional SG$3. If you are fit and can walk the distance, you might just as well save yourself some money. You will need to pay SG$25 to enter any of the two canopies. My suggestion is to go for the taller one with water fountain. The first one, despite that it has plants and shrubs from all over the planet, the second canopy provides you with better perspectives of the Singapore cityscape and beyond. There are also gigantic LED lit trees that are akin to tree of life in the Avatar and it truly is a magnificent sight in the evening. There's also the sky rail that enables you to walk among the trees but at this time it's under maintenance and soon enough, no doubt it would be operational again. The downside of this attraction is that it's chockfull of tourists and there are many tired people towards the very end. Whilst the attraction is meant to be educational, many people simply ended up going through the motion because they couldn't pace themselves due to so many people behind them. It's quite a challenge and time consuming for visitors to having to return to Marina Sand by the Bay to catch public transport later as there are simply too many people there. As long as you have budgeted your time for it, it will be sweet!",,
,,Cloud forest 鉁旓笍鉁旓笍,4,,"We went to both domes, which at $28/person I thought quite expensive.

The flower dome was ok. We did the free tour. Our guide鈥檚 limited knowledge about the background of the Christmas exhibition was evident...the group added comments which were interesting and informative...for all concerned.

The cloud forest was impressive. We were there in time for the misting, by coincidence, managing to capture some gorgeous pictures as a result. I really enjoyed the peaceful feeling here. There were some information displays on the cloud forest and global warming but we skipped them.

In hindsight, I would skip the flower dome and just do the cloud forest.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,"This is a fantastic place. One should not miss this. It has two parts -- rain forest and flower garden. Both are equally good. The rain forest looks more exciting with multi level plants and trees. The view on the day time is good. But some people say night view is good. But in my view, the nature looks good in the sun light. So, we have opted to see it in sunlight",,
,,Enjoyable and worth the visit,5,,The Gardens by the Bay is a very interesting gardens to explore. The two domes are very different to each other and I would recommend spending time in both. The gardens themselves are free but you pay to go into the domes - $28 for both per adult. I would suggest that you do the flower dome first If you are limited in time or money my favourite was the cloud forest. When you step inside the cloud dome you are literally in awe at what has been achieved and the display in front of you.,,
,,Beautiful,4,,Gardens by the Bay combines the interest of futuristic gardening and traditionnal orchids. The setting itself is great.,,
,,A must when in Singapore even if you are not a gardener.,5,,"We travelled through Singapore specifically to see this garden. And we were not disappointed . Allow a half day and enjoy Gardens inside and outside. It was next to the MRT rail
So it was easy to get to and the 鈥榯rees鈥?were so good we had dinner in one. The light show at night was fun and was free as it is in the outside garden. So much to see and each Garden Dome offered respite from the Singapore weather as they were both climate controlled.",,
,,"Fantastic gardens, surreal trees.",5,,"This tourist attraction takes your breath away. We spent sometime on the skyway during the day and then walked to the Flower Dome which is 1 of 2 domes to see. It is wonderfully decorated with plants from various parts of the world and also had a Christmas theme. We took many photos on this day, there is so many lovely views, plants and decorations to see. We also made another trip back that night to see the laser light show and the trees etc lit up. The souvenir shops provide an welcome cool relief from the heat and have lovely range of gifts to buy.",,
,,Must do,5,,Went here for the 1st time in the morning was amazing and not many people. It鈥檚 stunning at night but the crowds are bigger,,
,,Rainy day visit but still fabulous.,5,,"We went on a day that rained so the skyway wasn鈥檛 open and we really didn鈥檛 wander around the gardens as much as we would have had it been fine, but it was still spectacular. What is a good rainy day activity, is to go inside the 2 domes. They are both amazing but our favourite was the cloud forest. We came back later for the light show which is a bit more restrictive with a million umbrellas but was still wonderful.",,
,,You can spent more than 1 hr for this garden,5,,"If you afraid of heights, think twice before you go up. You will need to buy the ticket to go up but is worth the price. Absolutely amazing when you reach to the top, the pathway support by the cable, so you will feel the pathway vibrate.",,
,,One of Asia's most original gardens,5,,"A wealth of plants and flowers, a true feast for the eye. Plant research. A huge success which has won multiple awards for its excellence in design and customer care. It captures the essence of a tropical garden providing the perfect environment to enjoy.",,
,,Beautiful contemporary gardens,5,,This is a must visit in Singapore without a doubt. It is truly astounding and rivals many English gardens. If you have visited places such as Chelsea I think the flower dome will impress less however. The super trees are a wonderful photo opportunity and the domes are architecturally beautiful if less impressive inside. The cloud dome is worth a visit though.,,
,,Brilliant,5,,"Absolutely brilliant. Totally enjoyed the light show to music. The whole place is wonderful , it's beautiful a must when visiting Singapore",,
,,Unique,4,,"Something unique,worth the visit.carry a thin sweater , it's a little cold inside.cloud forest is wonderful.kids loved it.",,
,,If you love gardens...,5,,"If you love gardens (AND WE DO!) then Gardens By The Bay doesn鈥檛 disappoint. Even if you don鈥檛 like gardens, it surely cannot disappoint. We loved the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest Dome. We got a re-entry stamp on our hands on exit of both and re-visited the Cloud Forest after dark for free, which was properly special. The Rhapsody light and music event in the Supertree Grove is worthy of a look at 19:45 although it helps to have a plan of what you want to do after it finishes (re-entry stamps on hands for the domes?). We had a simple but lovely Chinese late afternoon meal at Satay On The Bay at Marina Live Seafood And Steamboat. The nicest bits of this garden are the bits out of the way of the crowds, such as the heritage gardens and the Kingfisher gardens. We didn鈥檛 see the otters but we did see a huge monitor lizard and several herons. For the people with kids or no imagination, there鈥檚 a McDonalds at the Golden garden, although the coffee shop next door does really GOOD coffee. We liked this place enough to visit two consecutive days.",,
,,Lots to see,5,,"I went to the gardens 3 times during my stay in Singapore. The Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest. The Super trees walkway at night with Christmas tunes and finally the rest of the gardens walking along the lakes.
Its a stunning place and even though its a major tourist attraction there are still plenty of pockets of peace and tranquillity.
Loved it.",,
,,Way to Gardens by the Bay,4,,"A suggestion for tourist or people visiting the gardens for the first time. If you are afraid of getting lost while trying to get there, there is another alternative route.

Firstly, use the route located in Marina Bay Sands Shopping Mall's Bayfront Mrt station.
Secondly, please walk towards exit B, the underground pathway is decorated with mirrors and is directly linked to Gardens by the Bay.
Lastly, you can climb up the stairs or take the elevator by the side to the ground level. you should be able to see the ticketing counters when you are there.",,
,,Cannot be missed,5,,A great place to visit so much to see a so relaxing to go round and see the way it has been laid out breathtaking is the best way to describe it,,
,,Not that interesting,3,,The outside gardens are really nice but the domes are nothing special. A bit boring actually. The lightshow in the evening is nice.,,
,,Not much to see,4,,Place to spend if you have spare time for relaxing. Not worth the entrance fee. S$10 I paid to enter what they called Christmas wonderland. Found out like a simple playground with lots of foodstalls and crowded.,,
,,Very impressive,4,,"The gardens were very pleasant - there are three greenhouses - I went to the flower one which we enjoyed.
You have to pay to enter the greehouses, if you go to more greenhouses you get a discount.
We used the bus shuttle service when leaving to take us back to Marina Bay Sands complex (otherwise it is about a 10 minute walk).
If you need a peaceful break from shopping/sightseeing I would recommend this.",,
,,Expensive,2,,The places that are free are pretty boring to walk through and the other areas such as the domes and sky bridge walk have an individual ticket; which I suppose is just Singapore.,,
,,Awesome Place,5,,I think a must go place for all its so very well defined and very well nurtured spending time here was just wonderful...,,
,,Amazing Scenery,4,,"Although we only walked through the non-paying section of the Bay, we had lots of fun looking for the different wildlife around the garden. Weather wasn't the best but the experience was still cool!",,
,,A must see,5,,"Gardens By The Bay is spectacular both day and night. The stunning sculptures, beautiful gardens, relaxing waterways and hidden gems all provide for hours of visual pleasure. The Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are both worth the entry fee as part of your visit.",,
,,Unexpected.,2,,Christmas decorations this year were not fantastic and the cleaner service at the lavatories were horrible.,,
,,Beautiful ...,5,,The place is beautiful especially at night... and when the show runs during 15 minutes. I a great place to get lost with your friend/lover/family.... recommended only night time to me.,,
,,A delightful experience.,4,,"Gardens by the bay offer a unique experience. I had never seen a nature park curated so creatively ever before. It鈥檚 a man made forest , showcasing some rare plants ;aesthetically arranged all around. The super tree grove light & sound show is also very pretty . The flower dome & the cloud forest sections are such great places to spend time at. Overall , this attraction is such a delight !",,
,,Down under tour,5,,"We purchased tickets for the gardens from our rep. We were unsure of where to buy the tickets initially and our rep reduced the price. This is worth knowing for future reference!
We walked from our hotel then walked for most of the day around the huge site! You need energy and stamina to get around all the sights. We were advised to go late afternoon as this was the quite time. You can then stay to see the lights.
The tallest waterfall in the world and the largest glasshouse is amazing is just two facts that make it a must.",,
,,Wow!,5,,"This is an amazing place to visit!
Really a piece of art... great heads put together to come up with this design for everyone to enjoy and to please the eyes.

Great place for family and kids!

Will surely never get tired of coming back to explore..",,
,,very beautiful and worth to visit,5,,all of these man-made gardens are spectacular :) . really worth to see and i recommend you to visit this place with your beloved one !,,
,,Superb !,5,,"What a fab place to spend some time !
Despite choosing a rainy day to visit, we loved both the great greenhouse exhibits and particularly the 'wet one'.
Exhibits were in great condition and although they were in the process of changing back from the Christmas displays, it was still great !
I loved the feeling of being in the treetops and even up in the clouds.
There is a wide range of plant exhibits but also films, stalactites etc too.
Getting there is best done by MRT as we used the hop on hop off bus which stops where there are no clear instructions to access the gardens.
You can pay to use the tram access or walk through the beautiful external gardens.
Due to the rain the external tree top walk was temporarily closed and we had been looking forward to experiencing this ( there is an extra charge).
Whilst there it's also a good opportunity to take a look at the amazing Marina Sands Bay hotel too.
All in all, a 'not to be missed' experience in Singapore.",,
,,Unbelievable!!! A must see in Singapore,5,,This was one our favourite places we鈥檝e ever visited! It has such a magical vibe in the Cloud Dome & blew our expectations out of the water. A MUST see!!!,,
,,Another top attraction in singapore,5,,"Gorgeous gardens. Our visit was hampered slightly by the wet weather, but still pleased we went. Even the children loved the gardens :-)",,
,,A peaceful night with nature and music,5,,The night show with the music and lights created a festive and joyful atmosphere 馃挒 Both the domes were nice but I found cloud forest to be more interesting! The view from the pavement/sidewalk is really beautiful 馃槏,,
,,Christmas Wonderland Flower Dome,5,,Beautiful and very theraupetic for the eyes. Gorgeous decorations.Our favourite place. Nice flowers.,,
,,Yes...it's incredible,5,,"Honestly, this will be your highlight of singapore. This is just incredible, beautiful, well thought-out. The colours, flowers and fauna, and settings are exquisite. It is very hard not to get artistic and take fantastic photos. If you are in Singapore, you cannot miss this masterpiece.",,
,,Flower Dome Visit,3,,I came on the first week of Jan and i was sort of disappointed that there wasnt much flowers blooming at that time :/ but it was a beautiful conservatory nonetheless.,,
,,"IF YOU LOVE TROPICAL PLANTS, THIS IS A MUST",5,,"The first part of the Gardens by the Bay, was really a treat. Several areas with different plantings. The first part is made up of succulents of all sorts from several different parts of the world. Who knew how varied and beautiful they could be? There are then plantings for Australia that was quite good as I recognized many of the plants. There was an olive tree area, California area and...

Even though, I had read up on Gardens by the Bay, I really didn't expect such a great place. I can't describe how this place really is one of the best indoor garden that I've ever been to. There is such diversity to the whole concept, which is the point of the exhibit...from the top of what simulates a mountain and waterfall with mist and rain and the several levels, 6-7, of climates down to ground level. Many trees, flowers, orchids, bushes, bromeliads etc ...only thing missing were birds and animals. We took about 2 hours just to go through the Cloud Forest which I just described.

There is a restaurant called Pollen at one end of this building that we will be going to later tonight....more about that later...the menu looks great with salmon, steak, a 2 hour pairing menu...I was VERY surprised to see this as I thought it to be just a coffee shop type of place. We have a 1830 reservation which, will give us lots of time before the light/music show outside in the Gardens! Lots to do here and I haven't touched half of what is there!",,
,,Amazing!,5,,Do the skywalk first as there is always a queue and if it is wet it will be closed for safety reasons. Allow a couple of hours to see it all. Food is also good at Satay by the Bay,,
,,Vast Garden,4,,"It's a vast garden with big giant man-made trees. In the evening, when the lights goes on, it gave a beautiful view. We always visit this place when we were on Marina Bay area. Good place to relax and enjoy fresh air.",,
,,Just beautiful,5,,"We spent an afternoon at gardens by the bay, visiting the cloud forest and garden dome.
Both gardens were truly beautiful. The garden dome still had the Christmas theme, with decorations and nutcrackers. It was very quaint.
The cloud forest was spectacular. Opening with a huge waterfall and rainforest garden and canopy. Both gardens were air conditioned inside, which made it most comfortable.
The shuttle bus @$3 per person was well worth it. The other garden areas were well done too, all immaculate.
We enjoyed the sound and light show, which is on 7.45 and 8.45pm each night. Get there early, as it is free to watch and gets crowded.
The MRT stop is close by which makes it easy to get to.",,
,,Great attraction,5,,"We ended up going here twice during our stay as we loved it. There are two main domes to go and see. Cloud forest and flower dome which are out of this world. 28 dollars each to enter the both of them. If you don鈥檛 want to pay there is planets to see and do around the rest of the gardens specifically the trees, make sure you go to see these at night as they look spectacular. They also do a free light show 7:45 and 8:45 pm daily which is worth watching. If you fancy eating here go to satay by the bay for a cheap hawker centre eat. All the food we tried was really good.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"What a place with a great view. The only thing is you need time for this place. Both the domes are great and must see for nature photography lovers. It is expensive to go in for both the observatories, but then everything in Singapore is costly:):):)",,
,,Stunning,5,,"It an absolutely must in Singapur , everything is really outstanding, this place is well maintained and makes with nice taste of nature design and architecture all mixed together and added with , music lights and I just difficult to describe and better to see it, the performance at night it鈥檚 forbidden to miss it and then they do another one in the 鈥渓ake鈥?or fountain behind the towers after the mall which is wonderful even better. Just enjoy it however the weather will be.",,
,,Showing our son and daughter-in-law the sights of Sngapore.,5,,This is a must for any visitors to Singapore. The thought and planning that has gone into this exhibit is fantastic and also has thought provoking themes about what global warming can do to the planet that mankind has been entrusted with.,,
,,Magnificent,5,,Amazing. The skywalk is awesome and the Flower garden and Cloud gardens are mind blowing. You need at least a whole day to do all of it.,,
,,Jem in the CBD area,5,,Be prepared to spend a day here in Garden By The Bay. There are so much plants and trees carving out different themes of walking path around the garden. The paths are mostly flat so it is very disabled-friendly. I rode on my electric mobile scooter and could reach almost any corner of the garden. Take a map at the entrance as you are likely to get lost in this huge place.,,
,,"Absolutely magnificent experience, beautiful gardens,",5,,"To visit the Gardens by the Bay was truely magnificent experience. I have never seen gardens so sell set out, plants from every part of the world. The displays were fantastic. Walking into the mist was great, it gave another aspect of this perfect place and plants.",,
,,Spectacular,5,,Well worth a visit at night. Take your camera as it's An amazing place when lit up.hreatbexhibition on when we were there,,
,,Like a sci-fi movie,5,,"Walking around in this area feels like another planet. The real nature reserves is better for nature, but this area is odd worldly and a must-visit. Be here during the afternoon and sunset.",,
,,The best!,5,,"you lust cant get enough of it,day and night.it was christmas night and there was also a sound and light show!great!",,
,,Pretty good,3,,"Gardens by the bay is a cool experience but not sure I would recommend everyone to go. The indoor waterfall was really cool as was the dome in which it's contained, but the flower dome wasn't as impressive. Sure the flowers are cool but I don't think it's worth the price. Maybe my experience would have been different if I went at night to see the light show.",,
,,MET ALL EXPECTATIONS,5,,"Not only a welcome relief from very rainy weather but a fabulous few hours visiting both the cloud forest and flower dome. Buy either a single ticket for just one of the domes, or a double ticket to see both. Worth it for the information on the ecosystem alone, but it is much, much more than that. A real tribute to conservation. We'll done Singapore.",,
,,Brilliant Christmas light display,5,,"Gardens in the bay, great effort for the Christmas light display, music and lights our grandchildren loved it. Especially the snow!",,
,,So well presented and worthwhile,5,,So much to see and take in that you could spend hours seeing everything along with some gift shopping. The Christmas flowers and structures were still up so we enjoyed their perspective on various themes. The trees and shrubs were just magnificent! Crowds were fairly light for a Sunday and the staff were super nice.,,
,,Relaxing,5,,"Great place for a walk.

Botanical gardens and visitor attractions in the gardens such as the cloud forest and of course the super tree grove where you can watch the special light effects in time with the music which is great fun at night.

And if you are there make sure you visit Satay by the Bay. Really good choice of vendors to choose your street food satay from. Worth going just for this",,
,,Supertree Grove spectacular at night but underwhelmed by the conservatories,4,,"I visited the Gardens by the Bay at dusk and bought a ticket allowing access to the Cloud Forest, Flower Dome and Supertree Grove. It was peak holiday season and the place was overcrowded, especially in the Cloud Forest where there was a long queue waiting to go up to the top of the conservatory. Poor queue management by staff added to my frustration. The carnivorous plants at the top were worth seeing but low lighting throughout the dome made it difficult to see many of the other plants. I enjoyed the less crowded Flower Dome more. However, without question the highlight for me was the 15-minute sound and light show at Supertree Grove. These supertrees are quite spectacular and a must-see if you are visiting Singapore.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,This is a must for visitors amazing gardens and beautiful music happily spend several hours listening and watch the world go by. At night the park is lit up and is simply stunning. A great experience!,,
,,Curated Exotic Gardens & Both Domes,5,,"Certainly visit Gardens by the Bay and the Towers,
If you do the domes and get a good deal, do them.
I would allocate at least half a day to properly see the great variety of plants.
Incredible that all these range of plants from all across the planet are thriving in a conditioned man-made controlled environment. Perhaps parallels to Singapore's progress too ;)",,
,,Beautiful gardens,4,,"If you're lazy like me, an open-air tour bus will take you for a guided loop around the gardens, and the added bonus is that you will learn some things along the way. I wouldn't have covered as much ground without the tour and it gave me some great photo ops.

The Flower Dome was stunning. We had the fortune of visiting in the lead up to Christmas, with the place full of poinsettias.

Careful choosing the days you visit the gardens. The Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are often closed for maintenance so best to check before you commit. I missed out on the Cloud Forest.",,
,,Fascinating,3,,"Always love visiting this place. Always something new to see and the plants are really exotic. You can walk around for hours and enjoy yourself. Loads of fun with the family. Get lost in nature.

Sore point - staff not so professional - huddling together and giggling. When it rains the transfer buggies are suspended. No one gives any information and you just hang around wondering what will happen next. Needs to be addressed.

Despite that, its a wonderful place to be.",,
,,Enjoyable and informative,4,,"We enjoyed our trip to Gardens by the Bay, lovely walking through and taking in the nature. The Cloud Forest and the Supertree grove were particularly impressive. You need to allow a good few hours to see it all! There was a lot of information about sustainability, ecosystems and the different species which was very interesting. We also went in December so there was the Christmas Wonderland, the light show and the fake snow blizzard! The reason it gets only 4 stars is that I think it is quite expensive, especially as we had to pay extra for the Christmas fair, and the skyway wasn't included.",,
,,Fabulous plants,5,,Fantastic gardens featuring beautiful plants. Definitely worth a visit. It is enclosed so wether is not an issue.,,
,,Allow sufficient time to fully enjoy all Gardens By the Bay has to offer,5,,"Catch bus 106 from Bras Basar Road to Gardens by the Bay, for a scenic route to the Gardens.

Walk all around the beautiful Gardens and visit the two inside conservatories, at the Garden. Visit the Flower Dome before the Cloud Forest Dome. The Domes are absolutely beautiful and a welcome relief from the heat outside. The flowers change with the seasons. They had Poinsettia Wishes for December.

Lunch at Satay by the Bay on the waterfront was reasonable cost and delicious selection of food. Makan by the Bay stall 9 seafood hor fun cost $6.

The Gardens are beautifully lit at night. From 1-26.12 they have Christmas in Wonderland from 4 pm to 11 pm daily.",,
,,A must only for plant lovers,5,,"There was a long wait to get tickets Flower Dome and Cloud Forrest. The Cloud Forrest was a whole new experience absolutely brilliant, we did this first the Flower Dome. You could re enter as many times as you like on your day ticket.

Skywalk was closed due to weather for us so we missed out.
In addition the ground walks are extensive and free!",,
,,Spectacular in the evening,5,,This is a must visit if nothing but to see the trees light up in the evening which is quite spectacular,,
,,Impressive and Marvelous Art of Work,5,,"Impressive place to go with your family. Though we had only few hours to walk around, we've seen its beauty. How they made this, it's one of a kind and Singapore's beautiful tourist spot. Flower Dome and Cloud Forest is a MUST place to go guys.",,
,,Beutiful gardens,5,,"Nice gardens next to several other sights near Marina Bay complex, Worth the time to take a stroll. Lovely gardens.",,
,,"Fab, interesting and educational",5,,"Loved all of this and had really been looking forward to going to see it.. electric trees were the most disappointing for me, but the cloud forest and dome were simply stunning. Beautifully put together and great to get a headset to hear all about the different plants from around the world. Enough for all the family I think, but take a pushchair if you have toddlers as there is a lot to walk around.",,
,,Lovely Christmas fiesta,5,,"It was Christmas time , and the lights were amazing ! The snow was amazing and the ambience was just marvellous !

Ample of space to sit
And there was a acrobatic circus show too
Only thing was the eateries were too crowded and we have to get the food packed and ate under the big tree !
At night there was a fun fair and live show until the end !

Excellent place to visit",,
,,Christmas,4,,"Their christmas exhibits are always something to look forward to. Go in november to get a huge huge discount off the prices. Purchase online to avoid the lines at the location. Prices soar for tickets closer to christmas. All in all a very good outing. It will take alot of walking so do wear comfortable shoes, an umbrella and snacks. Have lunch before heading there as there arent much places to eat there.",,
,,Great park but overcrowded,4,,The park is beautiful but we spent more time queuing up than actually touring the place. My advice to everyone is to go during low season.,,
,,nice park,5,,this place with exquisitely laid out theme parks is a revelation not to be missed as part of your program..,,
,,Amazing Garden,5,,"I love this amazing garden.. i can see a lot of flower that i never see before at flower dome.. the cloud forest is also amazing place... a lot of place to take a photo and selfie.. before you go inside the cloud forest, make sure you dont have height phobia..",,
,,Hours of free enjoyment,5,,"Great place to unwind. Tons of little trails, iconic metal tree like structures that are beautifully lit up at night, good hawker options (satay at the bay - though it's a bit of a misnomer as the place offers much more than just satay), lots to see and do. Their facilities are top notch. All of this for free - even on a layover, I think this place would be well worth checking out.",,
,,Wow !! Great place,5,,We went here at night and watched the musical tree show. So pretty. The trees would light up to music. So magical The kids loved it,,
,,Fantastic,5,,Add this to your list. It is an absolute must to see. Beautiful plants abd gardens in an incredible setting magnificent structures and sculptures. Wonderful,,
,,De-Light-Ful,5,,Thanks for an amazing show. It's a maze so be prepared to walk Its a lovely place to get lost in. I recommend lying down to watch the show so you don't get a crick in your neck.,,
,,Top place to visit!,5,,It is a while I have been to Singapore but I still remember The Gardens by the Bay and it offers a lot to explore. Highly recommend to go on the top of the trees before sunset and also see the light show!,,
,,Wow,5,,"This is just amazing. It's nature in this century. Perfect, clean, perfection. It's what you would expect from Singapore. Don't miss it.",,
,,Good Place but too Much to walk though.,3,,Should visit both in day and night to have a complete view of the gardens. Too much to walk can avoid if you are not much into botanical interest.,,
,,Gorgeous,5,,"Really worth looking at, I could have spent all day in there just strolling around,very well laid out alot of attention and detail went into the planning.",,
,,Beautiful and Magnificient,5,,Gardens by the bay was worth the visit. It was beautiful and magnificient. There were so many varieties of flowers and trees exibited under one roof.,,
,,beautiful,4,,"beautiful and wonderful place in singapore, always coming to this place when visited to Singapore...",,
,,One of the best attractions in Singapore!,5,,"The Christmas lights show was amazing, wonderful place to visit at both afternoon and night! there is so much to see for couples and families but need at least 5 to 6 hours to enjoy fully.",,
,,"Good attraction, staff not so good.",4,,"This place is amazing - the night light show is good too. We were here in the lead up to Christmas and they had a Christmas market kind of set up happening with side-show games, and the like - was over the top - food was outrageously expensive and the staff unhelpful. They were probably jaded because of how busy it was but all they were interested in was telling us how much it cost.",,
,,An absolute must do attraction,5,,Set aside a whole day to visit this attraction. Everyone in the family will find something here that they love from kids to grandparents.,,
,,Pretty great experience (Just don't go during public holidays),3,,"Both domes were amazing. Cloud Forest (?) was especially jaw-dropping, i really have no other complaints besides the ridiculously long queue when i visited on 26Dec. The Christmas exhibition, i forgot the exact name, was pretty disappointing to say the least. The lights looked really cheap and not at all well-designed, the area was too packed to move about freely, the stalls and booths were too small to accommodate more than 4 people at once. Felt like the exhibition was poorly planned, all in all. Went in there, took a few pictures and left promptly. The choir was pretty good though, kudos.",,
,,Stunning gardens,5,,What a great place to Visit. Definitely worth it even in the heat. The flower Dome is air conditioned offering a welcome escape from the steamy weather,,
,,Beautiful!,4,,This is probably a must see in Singapore! The gardens are beautiful with plenty to see! Also make sure to see the supertrees!,,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,Without doubt do not miss the gardens by night more spectacular worth the 28$ per person it took us 2 hours to walk round at a slow pace of course for our age.You would sleep well that night after the walk,,
,,Singapore high life,5,,"A must see when visiting Singapore . Second visit for me took grandchildren this time. Lovely gardens, sky walk and walk ways. 2 huge brilliant enclosed domes .easy walking or ride on wagons. Hawker food available and restaurants...allow 3 to 4 hours minimum",,
,,Singapore Expereince,5,,Truly a blessing to be visiting Singapore over the festive Season.... Gardens of the Bay is a Must ...especially the Xmas Market .... so much to see and experience,,
,,A must see!,5,,What an amazing experience! Both domes were fantastic and so well set out. The displays of flowers and trees were beautiful. The focus on the environment is great but my husband and I had a laugh at how much steel has gone into building everything!,,
,,Spectacular night show,5,,We had some transit time and came down for the nightly show. Well worth it if you have the time. Very Alice in wonderland.,,
,,Beautiful,5,,One must visit this place . As Singapore govt claims that they want city in the garden . Beautifully built structure and breath taking view from top of rain forest area,,
,,Beautiful plants and flowers,5,,Gardens by the Bay offers a chance to look at beautiful plants and flowers from all over the world. The night light show at the Super Tree Grove was extraordinary.,,
,,Beautiful place,5,,"Had a great time. Spent a entire day here.
Clicked numerous pictures.
Few tips : Cloud Forest : Looks amazing as you enter but isnt worth going all the way up . However if u are a flora and fauna enthusiast you must take an elevator to the top.
Flower dome : Spend some time. Good experience.
Super tree groove : Click pictures. An amazing architectural marvel.
OCBC skyway : worth going up there for a beautiful view. Go only after the sunset for amazing pictures and view of marina bay sands.",,
,,fun to visit!,5,,"While we love to wander through the public areas of the gardens, we actually went into the flowerdome this trip, and it was super cool... only wish we had more time to see the other dome as well.",,
,,The Gardens,3,,"The Gardens are lovely it鈥檚 amazing to see so many different plants in one area.
When we got there we got on the audio tour bus $8 adults (not sure on kids prices) this was its about a 17 min drive around the whole garden which was good for us to see a little bit of everything so we could decided on what we wanted to see.
We decided to walk on the bridge which is up in the trees. This cost us another $8 per adults you can either claim the stairs ( I think there was 103 stairs) or take the lift up the view were wonderful. The big tree has a restaurant in it which opens for lunch and dinner. ( you should book this) the menu looked good lots of different foods to choose from, we didn鈥檛 eat there. We went up to the roof top to have a look around and then to the bar area to have a cold drink. For us to go up it cost us $12 per person for a glass of soft drink or juice I think if you wanted wine etc it cost $24.
I really wanted to look inside the 2 Conservatory ( flower dome and the cloud forest ) but seeing the standard rate was $28.00 per adult to go into both I decided to leave I had already spent $28 on me and there was 3 of us. The beauty of the place got lost with the amount of money they kept asking for.
I must say I had no idea on the cost because it was a last minute thing to go see the Gardens by the bay.",,
,,Awe inspiring!,5,,"The two ""domes"" at Gardens by the Bay are truly spectacular. The Cloud Forest with it's amazing array of plants and the fantastic waterfall were brilliant. A stroll around the dome at the base leads you to the elevator to the top for a leisurely walk via the walkways back down. The views outside the dome are just as good as what you are looking at inside.

The Flower Dome was full of semi-arid plants from right around the world and being Christmas time, also had a quaint Christmas display. It is amazing to see what human ingenuity can do.

Both domes are climate controlled and if you find yourself suffering a little from the outside temperatures and humidity, the two domes are the place to wander.

Having travelled by MRT to Bayfront we purchased the SGD$3 each Shuttle Service for unlimited rides. We did this mainly because we checked over the Cloud Forest first and then back to Bayfront for a wander and lunch through the Marina Bay Shoppes before going back to the Flower Dome.

To access both of the Domes it was SGD$28 each but I thought it was well worth it. There are options to eat, either in the Flower Dome or nearby.

Due to our time constraints we did not have much time to explore the rest of what Gardens by the Bay has to offer, but if you are looking to ""get-out"" of the feel of being in a city this is certainly the place to be with its myriad of gardens. A great place to let the kids run around and just enjoy being outside.",,
,,Superb visit,5,,Arrive later in the afternoon so you can have a look around and still be on site for the evening sound and light show which is really superb. Go to the Bayfront MRT station it is the closest until they open the Gardens by the Bay station.,,
,,So beautiful and well maintained,5,,"These gardens are beautifully maintained, with a wide range of types of gardens and plants. The must see sections are the 'supertrees' the big artificial trees made of plants, solar panels and lights, and the conservatories - the cloud forest in particular is stunning, you really feel like you could be in the rain forests of Ecuador.

Even if you're not a big plant fan, there's more than enough here to keep everyone happy. So beautiful, so worth a visit.",,
,,Great at night,5,,A must place to visit during the night time. Great light show and a magnificent view. This is right behind Marina Bay Sands hotel.,,
,,Amazing place,5,,"Well worth a visit for any visit to Singapore, avoid the midday heat for a comfortable day out, can get a bit hot otherwise.",,
,,amazing experience,5,,what a great way spend an evening. This garden is one of the landmarks of Singapore and rightly so. There is so much to see as well as just to sit and relax. I am sure I don't need to tell anyone it is one of the places to visit when in Singapore,,
,,Not really worth the considerable outlay.,3,,"Almost as much infrastructure, and engineering, as opposed to horticulture. There are some very impressive "" special effects"", with free flowing waterfalls, and walkways 25 foot in the air, around the treetops. But for all this, the displays seem secondary to the construction., and whilst the ""Flower Dome"" is rather good, it could be better with more imaginative and extravagant floral displays.
In truth, it is more of a circus , than a celebration of natural vegetation .
Not really worth the considerable outlay.",,
,,Enchanting,5,,"A plethora of gardens for all types of people. 2 Indoors that require money, but the outsidegardens are all free and a solutely beautiful. You can spend an hour or all day or multiple days, but remember to take it easy if you are not used to the humidity.",,
,,Skip the Waterfall-Dome,3,,"The two domes look quite impressive from the outside so we decided to visit the two different garden-concepts on a rainy day during our stay in Singapore (together with plenty of other people).

I was honestly not that impressed. Particularly the waterfall-dome - where we had to queue for 30 minutes to get up with the elevator - fell short of my expectations. The round-walks are rather short and not that exciting. The Flower-Dome was quite nice with a lot less people and more space to look around.

If you only have a few days in Singapore, my tip is to go to the botanical garden instead of the Domes.",,
,,Great light Show.,4,,Very busy but great light and music show. Arrive early so you can maybe get a seat on one of the seats around the trees. You can climb higher but we stayed on the ground.,,
,,A Must Do in Singapore,5,,This place is absolutely fantastic. It is a must when you are in Singapore. We chose to go in the evening to see the light display. Bought a ticket (S$8/each) to go to Supertree Grove at Garden by the Bay. The queue was massive but it's worth it. The light display starts at 19:45 hrs. You have a good view of trees lights display with the back drop of Marina Bay Sands Hotel.,,
,,Well worth a visit,4,,"Well worth a visit especially if can you be there for the light show at 7.45pm.
Note that you only need to pay for entry to the domes - you can view the outdoor gardens and light show for free.
While we were there the screens at the ticket booth were giving locals the choice of paying for entry to either one or two domes (with one dome cheaper) but only advertising entry to both domes for tourists (at the higher price) but if you鈥檙e a tourist and ask they will sell you a ticket for only one dome which is cheaper and probably all you need to see unless you鈥檙e totally into plants.
We saw the cloud forest dome and it was cool - even if you鈥檙e not into plants, the structure itself makes for interesting viewing. Even our kids (8 & 11) enjoyed it and they have no interest in plants at all.",,
,,Amazing,5,,Gardens by the bay was definitely something everyone must do. It was just spectacular! It a wonderful walk.,,
,,Visited at Christmas,5,,"Was waiting to see this in person once landing in Singapore. Go both in day light and night time. Christmas show was fab and worth 10 Sing to get in but not needed to see light show from distance away. Walk the gardens, stop and take it all in. Bring snacks and drinks with you - very pricey in the gardens. Took the metro there and back from hotel - very user friendly, clean and felt safe even at 11pm night.",,
,,Nice views. Didn鈥檛 pay the expenses be entrance fee,4,,We came here but opted not to pay the $28 pp for entrance to the flower dome and cloud forest as we just left beautiful Bali. The gardens are gorgeous and it鈥檚 worth a walk about. Huge lizards in the underbrush! The children鈥檚 water playground looked like fun but our kids are too old. Ate lunch at satay on the bay which was great. Very clean restrooms st the Garden.,,
,,Visit during Christmas Wonderland,3,,"The Christmas lights were wonderful. However, to appreciate the gardens and its surroundings, visitors should visit the gardens during the day. The Cloud Forest and Flower Dome garden night lights were too dim and hence we are unable to see clearly the exhibits and hence we were unable to appreciate the gardens and its surroundings. Unless, you are at the gardens to see the Christmas lights and the decorations I advise visitors to visit it during the daytime. On the day of the visit the crowd was too large at the Christmas Wonderland. By the time we got to the OCBC Skyway the gate was closed. The organiser should have extended the opening hours of the OCBC Skyway so that everyone get the opportunity to experience the scenic stroll on the skyway. By the way the closing time was 9.00pm (a bit too early for such an occasion where they are many visitors to the gardens).",,
,,Escape from the hectic madness of city life,5,,Impressive what is constructed here. You can experience the rain forest atmosphere with real clouds being released every two hours. We chose the rainforest dome. Opposite is another flower dome.,,
,,A Green Oasis,4,,"Totally a unique experience.... As it's just not another garden or plants on display...
The whole concept is unique... The architecture... The display concept... Light and sound show....
Very convenient to reach and in a beautiful location...
Two domes are the highlights... Both on a different concept... And interesting As displays and themes keep changing.
Different theme parks around are interesting too...
Another highlight is sound and light show which happen in evenings...
Super trees and walkway is another unique experience.
Good place during pleasant weather..
Many dining options available... Including McD's...
Good place with kids...",,
,,Lovely Gardens,5,,Jason Statham led me to this garden. Loool. Very green and soo beautiful almost looks unreal. Must see in Singapore,,
,,Mr Mohammed and family,5,,Garden by the bay was an amazing especially the cloud dome with a huge water fall and flower dome with flowers and Christmas decorations,,
,,Amazing experience!,4,,"A must if you love plants and flowers like I do. Ticket price was S$28 for 1 person. The garden is very look after. We have seen some Exotic plants there, we took loads of pictures of the plants.",,
,,Loved this place.,5,,We only did the flower dome and will catch thecloud forest next visit. We were continually wowed during the2hours we spent inside this place. Excellent variety of plants and sculpture with special Christmas theme at lower level. Well worth the visit and cheap.,,
,,Amazing Architecture!!!,5,,Singapore outdid it鈥檚 self. The vertical gardens are just amazing. We got there about 11am and it wasn鈥檛 too crowded. We opted for the bus tour around and to go up to the viewing towers. Not a good place for those with a fear of heights. We also went to the Cloud Forest and it was well worth the $$. It was truly a relaxing and amazing place to visit!!!,,
,,Spectacular,5,,"Worth stopping in Singapore just to see this. Too hard to describe the amazing concept, engineering and horticultural genius this is. We also paid the $20to go the the top of the biggest tree to have an included drink. I usually think this is a tacky thing, but we had an outside table- it鈥檚 freezing inside, with a lovely breeze and ended up spending the rest of the afternoon up there enjoying the view towards the harbour. All the gardens are fantastic. Don鈥檛 miss the big fish aquarium, huge lotus ponds, otters, giant cactus gardens. All wonderful",,
,,Just Beautiful,5,,"This place is so beautiful and so well done, day or night it will blow you away, the flower dome and cloud dome are so well done, the night light show is just stunning, it is a must do on your Singapore holiday.",,
,,Outstanding!,5,,My favourite was the Cloud Forest dome. It鈥檚 amazing what they have been able to create. The day we visited it was hot and humid outside so the domes were a great escape from that - a lovely cool oasis. The plants everywhere in Gardens by the Bay are beautiful. We also took the audio tour shuttle to get a good overview of the entire garden- without it there would have been a lot of walking to see everything. I would recommend at least 4 hours to see everything.,,
,,One visit isn't enough!,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is an impressive attraction in Singapore that you should visit. The Supertree Grove is one of the main attractions of the gardens and it's hard to miss as they're pretty big. You can walk along a bridge up among the Supertrees which provides a good view of the gardens and of Marina Bay Sands.

I recommend coming both in the day time and in the evening/night time - particularly 7:45 or 8:45pm. At night, Garden Rhapsody plays which is a really cool sound and light show in Supertree grove.",,
,,A must do attraction while in Singapore.,5,,"We have seen this before but it is one of thoes attractions you keep going back to if you are in Singapore.
It is a inspiring to see the beautiful gardens, the price is reasonable, there is no discounts for seniors if you are not from Singapore. We spent hours looking at the gardens.We have also have been to visit the gardens at night, it is totally different, the night show is special the large steel trees light up, it is very safe, many familys are there.
Cabs are cheap In Singapore there are plenty at gardens by the bat exit.",,
,,Spectacular Attraction,5,,My husband & I spent half a day exploring the gardens by the bay. We arrived at the beginning of November & just managed to see the magnificent pumpkin display before they changed it to the Christmas display. We were in both domes & also took a walk along the skyway.Everything was well worth seeing & I especially loved the cloud rainforest. It is such a beautifully maintained attraction with something for everyone & a must do if you are in Singapore. Would highly recommend.,,
,,Incredible experiencef,5,,Excellent place to spend the day. What a great experience. It was a lot of fun discovering this gem in the heart of Singapore. I could have spent several hours in here!,,
,,Superb - have been many times,5,,.. I keep going back for a wander round / or watch the sound and light show. Deservedly popular with tourists and locals Best viewed at night when cooler.,,
,,Beautiful,5,,"Gardens by the Bay are absolutely gorgeous and there are tons of photo opportunities! It鈥檚 located very near MBS and many, many other fun things to do! This area of town is not to be missed!",,
,,Nature in a world of banks,4,,"Singapore is famous for all the high buildings. If you're searching for some nature between all the buildings, go to the Gardens by the bay. And if you're there in the evening, watch the lightshow (it's at the ""supertrees"").
It's a nice place to enjoy a book or taking a walk.",,
,,Perfect place for relaxation and fun,5,,It's a lovely garden and lots of great facilities you can find in the garden by the bay. Nothing else but fun! Well decorated and maintain. The only minus is the long queue to go up the Top Trees forest and into the.flower dome. We need to wait late in order to get on.,,
,,Nice Place,4,,I love this place. Clean. Cooling. Nice. Plants are beautiful. The only shortfall is the fnb outlet in the dome service staff not very friendly. The way he talked was bit rude.,,
,,Gorgeous,5,,Stunning place. Can get very busy so get there early. Plastic ponchos available for rainy days. Shuttle bus only $3 and once wrist stamped can have multiple trips. Covered walkway from MRT.,,
,,Very cool example of horticulture,4,,"The gardens by the bay were definitely a great example of horticulture with an Asian twist. The facilities are excellent with good choices of restaurants and cafes. However, the paid attractions are not worth it in my opinion. The supertree display is really impressive and the view at night with the lights is fantastic. I would suggest going in the evening to see how it looks in the daylight and catch a glimpse at night. Enjoy the views of the marina bay sands of which impressive pictures can be taken from the main entrance to the gardens. Don't stick around for the music and light show. It is tacky :)",,
,,Fun visit,4,,"My husband and I toured the gardens by the bay and enjoyed our time their; roughly 3 hours. After paying $18 SGD per person to get into the flower dome and the cloud forest, we entered. I was very impressed by the structure itself. The glass and steel dome is incredible. I was also really impressed with the size of the trees that were inside the flower dome. Lots of great photo opportunities. Look for the European olive trees. The cloud forest has some great vignettes of flowers; the carnivorous plant display was my favorite. The temperature in the domes was also a lot cooler than I had expected. It was a welcome break from the Singapore heat and humidity.

What the domes lacked, was any real information. We did not get the audio tour so maybe this was our mistake but there is any significant signage describing the mission of the gardens, why they chose the plants they chose, and any real major facts about specific plants. I was especially disappointed with the final exhibit of stalagmites and stalactites. There was barely any explanation about them and nothing about where these samples were from, etc...really disappointing.

Overall, a fun walking tour but didn鈥檛 really learn anything new or exciting about what I saw, which was a bummer.",,
,,Worth 2 visits during the day and again at night! Is a must,5,,"The highlights of this were the view along the tree tops it鈥檚 a must do and I would recommend doing during the day and again at night as the whole thing light up is amazing.

The domes were Interesting, well planted and very cool inside in terms of temp the AC was well and truly on so maybe bring a jacket.

Easy walk terrain for all levels, clearly signposted its a bit of a walk from the Bayfront MTR but you can also take a taxi which will drop you off right at the front too which is what we did and was totally reasonable and worth it. To make the best of our time there.",,
,,Pretty man made botanical place,5,,"Visited here on Jan 3, 2018 and did the flower dome, cloud dome and OCBC skyway.
The garden rhapsody show at the super-tree grove also includes the Bollywood track - Chaiya Chaiya from Dil Se! Some of the Xmas ornamentations were still there though Winter wonderland had ended.",,
,,Wonderful! Breathtaking!,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is absolutely fantastic and a credit to Singapore. We went three times in four days spent in Singapore - once on a rainy day, which we spent inside the glorious domes - so cool and tranquill, even with thousands of visitors. The second trip was at night - a must do - and the final trip we took the audio tour and then walked around outside. Excellent value - you would pay twice as much for the domes anywhere else in the world.",,
,,Light Show,4,,Used the Grab taxi network - cost $20 each way from Bencoolen. Light shows were on 0745 and 0845 lasting about 20 minutes each. Worth seeing and costs nothing just to see the lights.,,
,,I wish I could live here,5,,This place is just magical. The cloud dome and flower dome is pure heaven. Certainly the best tourist place in Singapore. Redeem your Singapore Airlines boarding pass to get a discount.,,
,,Impressive but it wears off,3,,"You can鈥檛 help be impressed by this attraction. Night (dark) best time to view if you have to make the choice of timing with the light show we did not see.

Entry to gardens free but the items you really want to see makes up for it. Cloud Forest worth entry ($12 SGD) although exhibits of stalagmites and tytes artificial and were better left out to make the gardens authentic, Flower garden wasn鈥檛.",,
,,Beautiful,4,,Beautiful place! Was well worth the visit. Kids all enjoyed it got some beautiful photos. Was very cold in some indoor areas,,
,,Always great,5,,"this time I went in the evening so we could also see the outdoor light show. Gardens were lovely except for the mins of tourists who come from cultures where u push thru and bump u out if the way to get a 700th selfie.
Light show was nice views of marina sands soecial.",,
,,A must see,5,,"Very nice place to visit while in Singapore. A great walk, and some interesting plants and exhibits.",,
,,Beautiful Visit,4,,Definitely a beautiful attraction. The first thing that greets your eyes upon entering is a 115 feet waterfall in the Cloud Forest.,,
,,Way overpriced,1,,"Just like almost everything else in this city, you leave wondering what exactly you paid for. I wouldn鈥檛 recommend.",,
,,Wow!,5,,"We arrived at about 5.30 pm , which we had been told was the best time to go, We had a walk round the gardens , then went in the flower dome , it was beautiful. Then we went to the tree area as it was Christmas it was very festive with a light display, and with the Marine Bay Sands hotel in the back ground it was spectacular. Once it was dark we went in the forest dome , it was like walking in to a set of Jurassic park, with the mist and waterfall, it was one of our favourite days in Singapore . If you find yourself in Singapore I recommend going there,",,
,,Christmas wonderland,2,,"We got to GBTB via Bayfront mrt on Christmas Eve. I got tickets online for Christmas wonderland and 2 conservatories. Naturally I would enter via the entrance situated nearest to the mrt but I was denied entry in the basis that my ticket needed to be redeemable only at a booth situated at the flower dome (which was a 15 Min walk) before I was able to enter Christmas wonderland. I had young children and elderly in tow and the walk was impossible, essentially I had no choice but to pay for the shuttle. I asked for some flexibility to enter Christmas wonderland and walk through it to the flower dome as I was already at the Christmas wonderland entrance but was told that鈥檚 I couldn鈥檛 because GBTB had no control over it as they partnered with presumably some other operator for Christmas wonderland. I don鈥檛 understand why there is only one booth for redemption of tickets inconveniently located at flower dome. They should have made it more user friendly - surely it would have made sense to have a booth located near the mrt. It does not matter to the consumer whether the both was run by GBTB or another operator, the organisers should work together to create a seamless experience for visitors. Worse still, it was Christmas Eve and yet the shuttle ended at 9pm. I had to take the long walk back to the mrt which was difficult for young children and elderly. This also does not make sense especially when public transport is encouraged.",,
,,relief from the heat,5,,This is a great way to get out from the heat with your kids and walk around some beautiful greenery. Both domes are worth visiting!,,
,,Must watch at once,4,,Excellent piece of architectural marvellous of Morden concept A beautiful concept bring us close to nature I feel the feel of my himalayas residence here in Singapore Must see,,
,,Excellent,4,,"Really amazing ! A must see for everyone, really worth it. This is really one the best attractions I have been to in Singapore. I will highly recommend all families to visit.",,
,,Beautiful and spectacular gardens,5,,Fantastic gardens with 鈥檞onderland feeling鈥? Amazing constructions and wonderful views. The kids just loved it! We visited the green house with the cloud forest and it was spectacular (a bit colder than expected though).,,
,,Huge space to run,5,,Great place for family outing!! Lots of space to walk and run!! Could spend literally half a day here just to laze around !!,,
,,Fantastic place to visit with a baby,4,,"The place is aircon and it was great for us as we were looking for a place to visit but we needed aircon for our baby as he was having eczema flare up while we were at Singapore

Highly recommend this place. It was clean and nice and we can move around with a pram as well.",,
,,wow!,5,,Great experience to visit Garden by the bay. Could be the best man made habitat to spend your time at. Magnificent especially at night time.,,
,,Worth Seeing,5,,"Garden by the bay is in the main city area near Marina Bay Sands. This is free walk bay in the garden. Include two chargeable areas, Flower Dome and Cloud Forest, which are are word seeing",,
,,Something different,4,,The rain forest one way the best by a long way. A good excuse for a walk in pleasant surroundings. Plenty of eating places scattered around as well. A little artificial - but we are in Singapore,,
,,Beautiful!,5,,"So much to see in a day, ran out of time so definitely have to come back! Great for photographers and if you fancy a more relaxed day.",,
,,A MUST DO - TAKE YOUR CAMERA,5,,"We loved Gardens By the Bay! With limited time in Singapore we visited the domes during an afternoon, and then returned the next evening to enjoy the Christmas light show. The surrounding gardens would be a lovely place to picnic.",,
,,Superb. Make sure to visit daytime and night time.,5,,What an absolutely incredible place..we saw it during a monsoon and it was still really impressive despite the grey skies. The best time to visit is in the evening once it has gone dark to see the lights..unfortunately the sky walk was closed due to thunder when we visited otherwise we would of gone up. Make sure you visit satay by the bay within the park for very affordable and very tasty food during your visit.,,
,,Wonderful place,5,,We had a lot of fun here and very natural place to visit. Amazing buildings. Wonderful garden and tour around the garden.,,
,,Crowds could be better managed,3,,"It is definitely a beautiful attraction. My family of 6 including my 3yo was there on 24 Dec for Christmas Wonderland. I had to leave with my 3yo half an hour after we got there because of long queues everywhere especially for food. Service at Pollen was appalling, the staff didn鈥檛 look interested in manning the entrance to guide customers into the cafe despite empty tables. The queue for Mc Donald鈥檚 was out the door and stretched for quite abit. Maybe during peak season you could limit the number of people entering into sessions and have pop up food stalls/trucks to help with food queues. I will definitely visit again when I return to Singapore for a holiday just not during your busy period.",,
,,WOW!!,5,,"I visited Gardens by the Bay - only had about 3 hours - caught a MRT (their train) to the Gardens - so easy, clean and it delivers you right there (Sydney could learn from this rail system)....we visited Cloud and Flowers dome ......as it was close to Christmas, the flower dome was just beautiful with Christmas decorations......it is simply stunning, cool as well as it was quite humid outside. I even noticed a lady sitting on a stool, deadheading a daisy bush, so patient, she was a volunteer.....very relaxing she said. The Cloud Dome was so different, almost Jurassic type, mist, waterfalls, ponds, unusual plant life and when you walk out, a movie screening about climate change.....arrgghh that spoilt it, can't we just look at beautiful things without politics getting in the way. Perhaps a film/movie about how to not throw rubbish on beaches, parks etc. as they find their way in the rivers and oceans and can affect sealife.........there's a thought Gardens by the Bay!!!",,
,,Beautiful place to visit,5,,Had an excellent afternoon walking around exploring the gardens. The flower dome was really beautiful but our favourite part was the cloud forest with its indoor waterfall and treetop walkways,,
,,"Excellent day in nature, regardless of the weather.",5,,"Singapore has a typically tropical climate. Due to the equatorial sun, the high humidity and frequent rain, it's best to be wary of planning outdoor activities involving a lot of unprotected walking. For this reason, Gardens by the Bay is the perfect spot for an active day of tourism. If the weather permits, and you have lots of energy, you can walk the outdoor gardens. Otherwise, you can take the trolley tour, zip through the grounds, including the supertree grove, and go directly to what I consider the main attractions: the flower dome and cloud forest. These giant greenhouse structures showcase Singapore's ability to turn a potentially inhospitable environment into an accessible, beautiful, educational experience for the entire family. The flower dome features seasonal displays of flowers from around the world. The cloud forest is a faux mountain designed to be explored on foot, passing through and above waterfalls, various gardens and environments, displays and interactive experiences. It's a photographer's dream and interesting for every age. As everywhere in Singapore, restaurants and gift shops are never too far away. There are special areas within the garden for children's activities which we didn't need, but looked great for those that do. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Gardens by the Bay and look forward to going back, as there was too much to see in one day.",,
,,Relax and enjoy,5,,"Like a piece of heaven. Very quite and relaxing place. A must in Singapore, especially after the sunset when the lights are On.",,
,,Christmas Wonderland at Gardens by the Bay,4,,"Overall atmosphere was great, lightings were amazing, just that the walking distance between the attractions was a bit long for young kids (3 years old)",,
,,Clever,4,,Beautiful and clever. Not too crowded. Easy access. Liked the sculpture in the gardens too. Good activity,,
,,Singapore,5,,"You have to see them, wonderful. But watch the rain showers, take an umbrella. Also worth doing is the hop on hop off bus, takes you all around the city. Take advantage of the 48 hour option if you have the time. There are three main lines to choose from, and also the Duck and Trolley version.",,
,,A must visit,5,,"It was great to experience visit Garden by the bay, good to go with friends & I was there with my family and 2.5 year old son. That was a excellent experience for my boy as well.

Unfortunately we were there day time and was really hot and we did not have enough time do another visit in the evening.

I strongly recommend to visit in the evening too as the lights and scenery are very beautiful.

Probably not a good view as we visited in Aug2017, but only to write review now Jan18. In all, a place worth visiting. Either yourself, or with friends 锛?or with family even with young kids.",,
,,New Year Visit,5,,"Fantastic pace to spend an evening, would highly recommend a visit. Unless your massively into plants I wouldn't bother visiting the Domes. There's light shows on also in the evening that's nice to see.",,
,,man made nature,4,,"its one of the best attractions in singapore. you can see could forest flower dome, super trees (my favorite) along with music show in the night.",,
,,A must,5,,"In Singapore this is one iconic park that is a must on everyone鈥檚 list. Accessible to young children up to senior citizens , those in wheelchairs or with strollers. Magnificent especially at night . Don鈥檛 miss the light show",,
,,A must,5,,"Well, it鈥檚 a highlight if you are visiting Singapore. I would suggest coming towards the late afternoon as you can enjoy the light show as well.
The bio domes are amazing especially the one with the indoor waterfall.
Make sure you have at least 3 hours to enjoy this park and all it has to offer.
Impressive",,
,,Great Place To Spend A Day !,5,,"Gardens By The Bay is a beautifully done, and well manicured indoor garden basically, complete with waterfalls and high level viewing areas of the whole place.
There are gardens from all different countries, complete with native plants from those countries.
It's quite easy to spend a whole day there.",,
,,Spectacular. Expect crowds.,5,,A must see. Tickets can be pre purchased to avoid the ticket lines and both domes are fully air conditioned. I won鈥檛 spoil it with details but a must see attraction.,,
,,Trek the world in 3 hours,5,,"Whether you are a serious student of botany or otherwise, you cant help marvel at what has been created here. Brilliantly conceived, this garden allows you to see the flora of the different climatic zones of the world . Amazing stuff. if you are interested in the plant world , go with someone who shares your interest , so that you can linger and appreciate .
Some parts of the garden can get chilly , so a light pullover would be recommended",,
,,Unbelievable,4,,I have never found anything like this place. Best place to take pictures in Singapore. Recommend place to visit if you're coming to Singapore.,,
,,pleasant place to visit,4,,fantastic architecture surrounding these gardens and easily reached on the SMRT. well worth a visit.,,
,,What a wonderful place,5,,"Take the time to soak this place all in!!
The set up is incredible and the collection of plant life is simply beautiful.

For a tourist attraction that you can spend hours and hours walking around, it's great value too.

The super trees feature is pretty cool during the day, but it's all together something else by night!",,
,,totally awesome,5,,"a very nice place. worth the entrance fee. with wide collection of plants, trees, flowers, others. a refreshing place to be at. one can say that you can live inside the dome with waterfalls.",,
,,Interesting Afternoon But a Little Tedious,4,,A nice afternoon but having spent the morning in the Botanical Gardens it was perhaps the wrong day to visit here and as the afternoon wore on it became more tedious. However had we visited this first I'm sure my opinion would be tempered.,,
,,dream like,5,,Impressive entertaining amazing. Hard to find words to describe the gardens. They are really magical and I am truly happy I got to see them in my lifetime. magical.,,
,,A must see!,5,,We went here for a walk and it鈥檚 so beautiful! Loved the place so much. We got loads of photos to show to my family. Will be back when we can again,,
,,Beautiful,4,,Recommend visiting the Cloud section. Air conditioning provides welcomed relief from the humidity and it is such a stunning place to see. Gorgeous spot for photos and views over Singapore.,,
,,Beautiful free experience right by Marina Bay Sands,5,,"If you're a tourist in Singapore, it is possible to enjoy all the parts of Singapore, without spending much money and this is one of them! You can spend only 6$ to get the perfect skyview of Singapore (Pinnacle at Duxton), MRT train your way through Little india, Chinatown, Eunos Malay Village, and walk your way through this city for little money. Gardens by the Bay is the Central Park of Singapore and is attached to the glitzy casinos of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. You can walk into that hotel and its fancy shops for free and this garden is also free too!

The garden has many parts. My sister and I biked our way into this park and parked there and walked around. There's an electric forest of sorts called the clouds which are these electric trees that feel mystical like some avatar scene. If you are patient and wait to 7 or 8 or so , you can watch an awesome light show for free. You can pay some money to climb these trees and walk around the tree tops if you want.

There's a children's water park that even adults can run through after a hot day with showers and bathrooms near by. It is fun and right next to it is the cactus gardens.

Now if you really love flowers and orchids, you can pay 28$ to go take a look at the conservatory complex! I didn't go in, but I've heard raving reviews of this place. The cloud dome and forest are air conditioned and in doors.

If you're hungry, there's plenty to eat in either the conservatory for $$ to complete your fancy experience or you can take a walk to the Gardens Satay hawker food like place- a little pricier than most hawker centers, but you can get your local eats and drinks here.

This is a must for anyone coming to Singapore- it is right at Marina Bay Sands and if you're already going to spend a day in this area, may as well walk through this to get how beautiful Singapore is and how much they pride their city in a forest status!",,
,,Great day out,4,,We had a great time. Only problem was that most of the food/ hawker stands for food was still closed at 11h30. A must visit when on holiday to Singapore.,,
,,Amazing,5,,"The Gardens by the Bay are amazing, absolutely gorgeous and worth a visit. I pay to go into the cloud forest and flower dome. I loved the cloud forest, it was really cool and includes a cloud walk through the forest/dome. The flower dome also had some amazing plants - if you love flowers, this one will be your favorite. It look me about an hour to go through both domes.

I also did the skyway, which had amazing views, and it was fun to walk through the ""trees"". This took about another 30 minutes. In total walking around the gardens and doing all 3 above, I spent 2 hours there.

There were a ton of families and it is kid friendly. I am traveling solo and it was great for that as well. It is honestly like a very well done theme park (without rides) around plants. There are shops, restaurants, very clean and nice restrooms, and very friendly and helpful staff.

Overall great experience.",,
,,"Nice stroll through the gardens, unfortunately was raining",4,,"Having been away from Singapore for many years, I took my family to this place as it looked great in the pictures. It was a vast area and very family friendly, looks really expensive to build. Everyone loved it. As I was there on New Year's Eve, the place was crowded despite the rain. We opted for both the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest, with a meal at the Hill Street Cafe in between. We were, however, not impressed with the food. I would suggest to eat somewhere else. This place is just a short walk from the MRT station. Suggest to spend about 3 to 4 hours here.",,
,,Great location for everyone,5,,I easily spent a whole day here walking through the different areas ... and it was boiling hot and humid. It's a lovely change from all the metal and concrete of the city.,,
,,Garden review,3,,It was fun. The kids really enjoyed how it was lit up at night. They offer a bridge walk which is cool for pictures and experience.,,
,,Fabulous,5,,Man made area which stretches some distance. You have the option of seeing all the tourist sites (and pay) or just amble around for free. Beautiful and quiet and lots of bike rentals along the way. Must see,,
,,Garden by the Bay during Christmas Season,4,,"Definitely a worthwhile experience to visit during Christmas season even though i have been to Gardens many times. The decoration, lightings and music were great!",,
,,Amazing attraction,5,,This place is breathtaking. Both myself and my girlfriend Bea loved it. Beautiful and very well planned and thought out. A superb day out.,,
,,Visit to garden by the bay,5,,Mesmerizing experience with the Christmas wonderland ticket. The light show takes you through a fairy tale realization. The flower dome was exceptional and could take pictures of many new bright flowers. The falls amidst the flowers was a new experience.,,
,,Brilliant,5,,"A must see. Beautiful, Peaceful and serene. Would highly recommend to anyone visiting Singapore. Easy to get to. Easy and close to MRT. Close Marina Bay Sands",,
,,"Wonderful, definitely worth a visit",5,,My husband I went to the gardens the week before Xmas. The light show was outstanding and the Xmas decorations were spectacular. It is well worth paying to walk around the high walkway. The gardens were stunning. Not to be missed.,,
,,Good place,5,,An amazing collection of flower plants from around the world. Great place to photograph. Water fall at the cloud forest is very nice. Can book the entry ticket on Klook for a discount price.,,
,,Amazing walk!,5,,Lovely place with a lot of green! The silence is amazing and the walk through the gardens near the waterfront give you a relaxed feeling.,,
,,Choose your visit date wisely,4,,"I'm sure we could have enjoyed our visit to Gardens by the Bay much more if it hadn't been so crowded! We were unaware that it was a holiday, and so many people were at the gardens we could not enjoy it. Queues at the flower dome and cloud forest were so crowded and not well controlled with many visitors pushing in. We only managed to see the cloud forest conservatory and spent the rest of our time wandering around trying to get into anywhere cheap to eat and it was even hard getting to the toilet. We couldn't get into the super trees area because of a Christmas function and left after a couple of hours, not having even seen the flower dome. So, long story short people, check the holiday calendar before you go!",,
,,Breathing taking and amazing sights,4,,"Visit Gardens by the Bay as I had overseas guests in town. This was my first trip there as a local, and being local, i am skeptical of everything made in Singapore. Started the tour with a tram ride which would give you a good overview of the garden's layout. ( you can purchase the tram tickets for under SGD10)

We then got off at one of the enclosures, the air was fresh and cool and reminded me instantly of previous trips to mountains in Japan. I was honestly overwhelmed with the beautiful sights of greenery, i am not a botanist so like you, i have no idea what i am looking at specifically but i love it.

Perfect for a full day of activities, take it slow and enjoy the sights and the water fall. Loved it so much, that i went back to visit 3 weekends in a row!",,
,,Crowded during Christmas,3,,"The decorations are very unique and attractive. Yet, we took about one hour to line up and enter the rain forest conservatory during the Christmas holiday.",,
,,Good place to visit,4,,"Overall very good,cloud forest didn't reached over our expectations. The waiting time quiet longer. What ever the theam and concepts all ok",,
,,An all weather attraction,4,,"It鈥檚 a long uber drive from the airport cost 35 Singapore dollars.
Ticket counter were very helpful and gave us discount as we were travelling with Singapore airlines and could show our boarding passes. Paid to go into forest cloud and flower dome. The external 鈥渟kywalk鈥?was closed as it has been raining hard. The forest cloud is very impactful- with the waterfall. We spent two hours wandering around. The flower dome didn鈥檛 take long to explore 20mins max but we spent longer in the forest cloud - doing the walkways - not good if you don鈥檛 have a head for heights and if you have any mobility issues. The funny observation for us was that the man made installations eg plants made of Lego & sculptures made more of an visual impact. Unfortunately we didn鈥檛 see Grove at night that would have been nice. Glad we made the effort to visit the gardens - it wasn鈥檛 busy as it was raining so hard",,
,,Christmas Wonderland at Gardens by the Bay,5,,"We went with my kids and friends to experience the Christmas Wonderland. It was beautiful in the evening. With Christmas carols, the light show and Christmas themed music that lit up the supertrees . Really mesmerising.
The food stalls are kind of overpriced but expected.
Great evening out with the kids.",,
,,Relaxing place,4,,"nice place to relax and enjoy the plants and sculptures. In December where the weather is a bit cooler, walking around the park is great.",,
,,Great indoors on a rainy day - amazing plants,4,,This was a great place to spend a rainy afternoon. The collection of plants is really quite amazing. There were special displays for Christmas which I felt were a distraction and took away from the other things.,,
,,One of the best places to visit in Singapore,5,,A really lovely day trip. Book tickets in advance online to avoid the queues. The domes are well worth entering but bring a wrap or jersey for the cold one. There's an amazing kids playground (free) with water jets etc in the grounds. Nearby is Satay by the Bay for excellent hawker food.,,
,,Awesome!!馃挴,5,,Gardens by the Bay is wonderful!! Must see!!I highly recommend everyone to visit this place at least once in a year!!馃挴,,
,,Spectacular light show,5,,"Gardens by the bay is beautiful even if it is raining which it did on multiple days of trying to visit the sky walk. Unfortunately we didn鈥檛 do the sky walk as they close during 鈥榠nclement鈥?weather.
We went the cloud forest which we really enjoyed but we didn鈥檛 find the flower garden as much fun! We came out of the flower garden and made our way to the super trees and saw the light show which was amazing. Definitely go back at night to see the light show!",,
,,Great for visit and long walks,5,,"Visited it during christmas. There was a special temporary christmas zone, which I didnt visit. I only visited the open part of the park and still spent countless hours. It's good for taking a walk and seeing a range of plants.",,
,,A preschool excursion to the flower dome,4,,"The flower dome is a children-friendly place to enjoy the floral displays. It is slightly chilly but still enjoyable. The children and I returned in the evening just for the ""aurora light"" display but it was very disappointing as it was simply shown on the screens.",,
,,Great place to check out,5,,A fantastic way to spend a morning - stunning little cafe inside (average coffee) but the whole experience is well worth it!,,
,,Lovely and Beautiful,4,,. Lovely and beautiful . The Xmas deco was great especially Xmas wonderland was very good but was raining but we did enjoyed it,,
,,Amazing - a must see!,5,,"We had a one night stopover in Singapore on our way home to Oz from Europe so wanted to see a few highlights to fill in our time. We decided to do the Gardens by the Bay and it was SO worth it! We caught a cab there as it's a fair distance from the main drag of Singapore. We were there right at opening to were able to avoid the crowds. We purchased tickets for the indoor gardens which was absolutely worth it, they are incredible. We also walked through the outdoor gardens which are beautiful too. We finished off with lunch at the McDonald's on site - which was a highlight for me because they have vegetarian burgers on their standard menu which we don't have in Australia!!",,
,,Christmas Wonderland GBTB,5,,Beautiful flowers from around the world are displayed. If visit Singapore it's a must to visit GBTB at least once.,,
,,Christmas Carnival,5,,To have the Christmas Carnival in the setting of a garden was a great idea. There were also lots of food around for the visitors. The ambience of the garden is just great. You can also relax in the grass slopes enjoying the night. Great place to visit and relax.,,
,,Singapore Trip,5,,One of the highlights of our trip. So much to see and do. We went at night and the lighting and setup was truly spectacular.,,
,,Nice gardens,4,,"Nice trip to the gardens, the flower garden was full with tacky christmas decorations and that did destroy the experience",,
,,Great place to spend an afternoon,4,,Wonderful park to just walk round and enjoy. Lots to see and also great for lunch at Satay by the bay.,,
,,Christmas Wonderland,2,,"We can鈥檛 understand why we have to pay to enter the 鈥淲onderful 鈥? Quite disappointed that it was a normal market with many food stall, that so. It should add stall for Christmas deco, Street performance.",,
,,Cloud Dome is much better than Flower Dome,4,,The exhibition in Cloud Dome is much more interesting than Flower Dome. Cloud Dome also has flowers.,,
,,Wow!!!,5,,Great day out! Magic during the day and spectacular ar night. Would be a very romantic place if you want somewhere nice to pop the question.,,
,,Very impressive,5,,"Even without being interested in architecture, this is impressive. Go there when it's dark. Eat at the hawkers market close by, cheap and authentic eats.",,
,,The most amazing experience,5,,"We were absolutely blown away with these gardens - the creativeness, attention to detail and beauty is astounding. it is very well laid out and you wont miss anything... sort of like IKEA! We booked a one way tour with Viator which included pick up from the hotel and entry tickets - $31 each. We had to find our own way back to the hotel but there are plenty of taxis waiting at the entrance and the fares are very cheap.",,
,,A Must See,5,,"The Double Conservatories are a must see in Singapore, even if a little bit crowded. You must go at Sunset to see the Super Trees Light and Music show !",,
,,Very nice,4,,"We visited here at night, to see the light show. It was very impressive and worth the cost of entry.",,
,,Great place for dating..,5,,"Visiting Garden by The Bay with my boyfriend, despite it was very hot, but still we enjoyed our time together.

The garden itself is wonderfully made, the concept of the garden is spectacular.

We have visited Garden by The Bay more than twice, yet we didn鈥檛 get bored of it.

One of 鈥淢UST VISIT鈥?location.",,
,,Great Gardens,5,,"one of the best gardens that we have been, walking round for hours looking at a lot of great stuff, when you go round the other side from picyure there are some nice works of art, like a massive floating baby",,
,,Wonderful garden in a green house,5,,This place is simply out of the world . The flowers and the plants are very well maintained . They spent a lot and have been very thoughtful. I loved the gardens by the bay. Great place must visit.,,
,,Beautiful Gardens and Domes,4,,"Very interesting, modern and well worth the visit... Good value for money and can spend a day there!",,
,,A must see in Singapore !!,5,,"An example of what creativity and nature could create..just wonderful ,we visited the Gardens by the bay with family and friends and just loved it although the flowers were not in bloom in the flower dome but the christmas decor all but made up for it our children 8-12 years of age did not want to leave the place ..just beautiful !",,
,,Flower Dome,4,,Beautiful and nice. Lovely flowers. The arrangements was very great and very order. Many colourful flowers.,,
,,A Flowery Affair,5,,"Beautifully preened reindeers pulling a carriage through the plush greenery of Gardens by the Bay. A true paradise for one & all but pure heaven on earth for people with a thing for enchanting flora. The flowery stretches are a treat for the senses, not to mention the freshness about the air inside the Flower Dome. A must visit for all.",,
,,paradise,5,,These gardens are the most incredible parks I have been to totally stunning.lots to do for couples and families.,,
,,A must stop in Singapore!,5,,We went after dinner to catch the best of the sunset and the Supergrove light show which was reviewed positively online by everyone. The metro trip was not far from our hotel and teh great Marina Bay Hotel is a wonder to view that led to the Gardens. A great light show(but totally a Mariah Carey Christmas spectacle) was worth the trip and it is best to find a place to sit on the sides of the Supergrove trees to view upwards. The Skywalk was nice if you can get up there as the queue was very long and people take their time on the walk which means waiting for 1 hour + to get up there!!,,
,,Just wow.,5,,"With over 40,000 reviews there is probably not a lot I can say apart from just go and have a look and do it both during the day and night.",,
,,Nice way to spend an afternoon,4,,"Go at misting time 12:00 pm, 2:00 pm (check for more times), take a sweater and while away an hour or so at this oasis.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,A must see! Very awesome place to visit! We loved it!! It takes a couple hours and is worth the money. Wasn't too crowded,,
,,Garden light show,3,,"The light show at Marina Bay Gardens start at 8.45pm and is worth a look, the kids will like it and from what I saw a lot of adults did too.
Most people go into the middle of the trees and look up when it starts, I found if you look around the garden and then just before the light show head back towards the stairs were there is a round grassed area with some chairs, you get a much better view from there.",,
,,Take a breather,3,,Take a stroll in the area. Good way to relax and unwind. Check out the indoor waterfall! All of it have cool and unique features :),,
,,Especially lovely at night,5,,"We initially walked through the Gardens by the Bay in the early afternoon and found it suspiciously devoid of people. We realise now this is because Singaporeans are not stupid and it is swelteringly hot and sunny during that period of the day, even if you do aim for the shadier bits.

Armed with an umbrella and sunblock it was however a great walk, even mom who doesn't usually take to gardens in a big way enjoyed the sculptures scattered through the gardens, some of the botanical features and especially the soaring metal trees.

We ended at McDonalds which, although I am not a fan usually, is an economical stop to pick up a snack, refuel drinking water (water fountain outside), potty break and most of all, aircon for a little bit!

Didn't have a chance to do the tree walk so can't comment on admission charge or views.

We returned to the waterside edge of Gardens by the Bay in the evening on the recommendation of a local friend. Such a good idea! In the evening the bridge was full of people walking to the gardens. And although we didn't completely go back into them, we really enjoyed the way they were lit up in the evening, while the absence of sun made it a really pleasant experience as it was still warm and well lit but in a more fairy garden way. Would have loved to have had more time to do an evening jog along the boardwalk.",,
,,Enchanting gardens,5,,"Easily accessible via MRT, get off at Bayfront station, short walk to ticketing counter. Pay an extra $3 for the shuttle that takes you straight to Flower Dome and Cloud Forest, both cooled conservatories. Entry cost of S$28 per adult /S$15 per child for two conservatories. Very beautifully structured, the cloud forest is especially awesome with lifts and escalators so easy to access even if you have difficulty walking. The outside gardens are all free but could be quite hot during the day, either go real early or later in the evening when it is cooler. Well worth the visit if you are into plants or even just want to look at beautiful gardens from different climates of the world.",,
,,Garrden By the Bay sight seeing,4,,First time with my children to this place and had a wonderful afternoon. The ambience is great with nice hawkers and McDonald. So no worry about catching rest and relax. There are mobile vehicle for ride though never find out the cost for the rent or whether if it is free.,,
,,Manmade Green Paradise - Must-See in Singapore,5,,"The Gardens by the Bay are huge air-conditioned glass houses hosting plants, trees and flowers from all over the world. Situated next to the Marina Bay Sands they are a must-visit when in Singapore. Take some time for enjoying this unique garden experience. The theme changes every two/three weeks, so it s worth to visit every time being in Singapore. Perfect place to be stunned, enjoy slow life and consider the importance of nature and its conservation.",,
,,Christmas was magical here!,4,,"Spent 24th night there in Winter wonderland and it did not disappoint! It was magical!! However the decoration was slightly headachy and way tooo ""shrine like"" instead of Christmassy and nice. The Cloud Forest was VERY cold, please wear a jacket!!!",,
,,Amazing!,5,,One of the highlights of our trip. The crowds were a little crazy seeing it was the local school holidays and Christmas as well but well worth it,,
,,Excellent,4,,Great concept and stunning exhibits. Probably needs more than one trip and a decent map to appreciate it fully. A bit pricey to visit the two biodomes and the treetop walkway though with prices being weighted against non-residents hence drops a star in my view.,,
,,Tick in the box,4,,"Went last week as couple in the night time. It was nicely lit due to Christmas, not sure if it's same all time of year. Did not go to any of the dome as we were not interested in watching nature that's grown artificially. Be prepared to walk a lot. Over all a destination as view from every side is amazing.",,
,,Mesmerizing gardens,5,,I could not visit the gardens the last time i was in Singapore so i made a special effort to visit them this time around. The beautiful flower dome with a variety of flowers was done up beautifully for christmas. The cloud forest with the spectacular waterfall was breathtaking. The exterior was lit up for christmas and truly beautiful.,,
,,Just sensational,5,,This is truly a landmark and the country should feel proud that they have created such a wonderful attraction that caters for all persons.The space variety visual appeal and the sense that one can lose themselves and contemplate the good in life is overwhelming.,,
,,Absolutely stunning,5,,Do not miss these gardens. They will blow your mind. So beautiful and creative. A great day full day out for all ages,,
,,Tourist,5,,"Not To Be Missed , Beautiful creation & very well Maintained very picturesque feel great to be their spend time great nature",,
,,"Can be visited if there is ample time left and is not a 'must see"" place",3,,"The entry tickets are costly. The tall water-fall is quite impressive. There is no major things to see inside, except for those who love to take pictures of creepy plants and some colorful flowers. It has good-to-see overall environment.",,
,,Absolutely beautiful place to visit,5,,"Clean, perfectly manicured plants and trees. Moves a lot of people in an effective manner. Highly recommended to visit.",,
,,Ever-changing themes are great,4,,"Gardens By The Bay is an attraction that never gets old, no matter how many times you visit. The flower displays at the cool - in all sense of the word - employ different themes throughout the year. Most recently, it took on Christmas markets theme, allowing visitors to this tropical country a glimpse into a traditional European Christmas scene.

The theme is carried out through the entire attraction, including the exterior gardens which were dressed in elaborate arches that light up at night.

Check the websites for upcoming themes. The ones around Chinese New Year are usually wonderful too.",,
,,Probably the best place to visit in Singapore,5,,"Gorgeous themed gardens with spectacular walkways to view from every angle. We were lucky enough to visit at Christmas time, the festive displays were brilliant.",,
,,Green Paradise,5,,"Absolutely an experience and we enjoyed it very much. Take your Time and walk around the Garden, have a snack at Satay By The Bay and then watch the light show at 7:45 or 8:45! You will not be disappointed. Stunning view from the Garden or from Marina bay Sands",,
,,"Absolutely amazing, a must see attraction!",5,,"We visited the Gardens by the Bay and paid the extra to visit the Flower and Cloud domes. The whole experience was out of this world with the wonderful displays of flowers and plants from around the world in the Flower Dome to the amazing inside waterfall in the Cloud Dome and the light display in the evenings. If you are planning your trip to Singapore, this is a must see, there is nothing like it.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,The world is full of such beauty and this place captures it. I would go early to avoid all the selfie sticks. The seafood restaurant was delicious and an oasis of calm.,,
,,Definitely go at least once!,4,,"It was a beautiful place but I think I had more expectations. I saw more greenery and less flowers but it was still so calming and exquisite. Definitely recommend going there at least once in your life, but not necessarily more than that.",,
,,A Must Must See,5,,"There is no place like this. You have to go and check it out. They have 2 domes, one is the cloud forest and the other is the Flower dome. Check out the flower dome first. It is full of colourful flowers and beautiful trees. If you are fond of pictures, take loads of them here.
Then head over to the cloud forest. It is unbelievable. You will feel like you stepped into the Amazon! You are welcomed by this 5 storey man-made waterfall. It is all misty and chilly inside. Do remember to carry a jacket while there. There are misting sessions that happen every 2 hours and the last one is at 8pm. Do not miss it. Also, one you enter and exit these domes, you cannot come back inside, so take in all that you can at one go.
Then walk outside, and the fun is not over yet. You have to look at those humungous urban trees and at night they look gorgeous. At 7.45 and at 8.45, they have a free light and sound show, which is NOT TO BE MISSED at any cost. It is free and you will see the crowd starting to gather 15 mins before it starts. People lie down on the floor to watch every second and every angle of it. It is a great idea! Do that!
Then there is the OCBC skywalk. It is S$8 per person to get on and they let you be for about 15 mins. It has an all glass floor. It is super fun to be on. Do not miss it. There is usually a queue to get on, so keep that in mind in case that coincides or is close to the light and sound show. Also, they stop selling tickets for the skywalk, so ensure you run down to get them. The counter is right below one of the trees close to the starting point of the skywalk. The others sell them too, but in case they are not sure if it is closed, they will ask you to head to that one. So when in doubt, run straight to the trees. They have a lot of restaurants around, you are bound to find a good place to dine there. It is not overly expensive, so you can try it. There is a restaurant on top of one of these Supertrees. We wanted to try it but there was a long waiting period.
Try and make it to this place in the evening around 4 or 5, and expect to enjoy the rest of the day here. Try avoid Sunday evening as it can get very very crowded then.",,
,,"Good place to be, too bad it was mostly raining",4,,"Have visited the garden for the 2nd time, unfortunately it rained a lot so we ended up sitting in the eatery for some time. The garden displayed lots of lighting since it's nearing end of year. In the evening at special hour they had artificial snow made of soap.",,
,,Cloud Dome : Cloud Nine,4,,"Out of the two domes, loved the Cloud Dome. Excellent setup and management. Flower Dome was little boring compared to the other. Vertical garden lighting started very late so if you want to see full lighting, you should wait till dinner time.

The Xmas carnival- Wonderland was not for people like me who have experienced such money spending games in many fairs and fete's in India. I felt I wasted my money there buying the tickets and few tokens.",,
,,Nice and very impressed,5,,Highly recommend to anyone visiting here. Two domes are changed by season. I came here evertime I visit Singapore.,,
,,It is a most go attraction,4,,Although it is very touristy and very packed it is a must go attraction. At least you are in a controlled climate environment.,,
,,Go for the cloud foresr,3,,Prices are in line with all other attractions in Singapore. Look out for discounts at your hotel. You may can save a few dollars. The cloud forest is worth to go. However the flower dome is not. It was disappointing.,,
,,Beautiful,5,,"These gardens are gorgeous. Wonderful to walk during late afternoon. Stay for the light show and look up at the supertrees, but get there early to get a seat by one of the lit up supertrees (not all of the trees are part of the light show). It was the highlight of our Singapore trip.",,
,,the gardens,5,,amazing collection of plants. even carnivore plants are there. the huge dome has unlimited variety of plants and flowers. must visit for a botanist.,,
,,Must visit,5,,Finish it with an evening at marina Bay sands and watch the sound and light show. Garden by the bay is great. If staying in this area you can go there every day for a jog.,,
,,Christmas@Gardens by the Bay,5,,"The winter wonderland, lights, markets, fair ground within GBTB was worth the visit and entrance fee. The light show with Christmas Carols playing was perfect for setting the festive mood.",,
,,Beautiful place to visit,5,,"I love how they have different exhibitions every few months. I visited during the sakura blossoms and tulips exhibitions. The flowers were stunning.

The themed exhibitions are in the flower dome, the temperature inside can get quite quite cold. Skip the Cloud forest if you have already been there before. Floor is slippery in the Cloud forest, be careful when walking especially near the waterfall entrance. I've been here 4 times, still mesmerized by the beautiful flora and fauna.

Buy tickets online to avoid the hassle and the long queue.",,
,,MUST SEE,5,,"Wonderful, colourful, stunning, vibrate, clever, Make sure you put aside a whole day to enjoy the domes at this location. You will be amazing at the architecture inside. In fact most of the time you are not aware you are even inside a dome. Well done Singapore..",,
,,Man Made Nature - Unbelievable unless you experience it!,5,,No words to explain the beauty and effort in creating it. It is now living space for soo many small species and you will not be able to believe that this has been created by Man. Must Visit and Remarkably Super Experience.,,
,,Amazing but Terrible Lines,4,,"This was an amazing place, especially the cloud forest, but the one thing I did not like was the lines. The lines were terribly long, particularly the cloud forest, but overall the place is quite stunning and definitely worth seeing.",,
,,Beauty at its best,5,,This was the most beautiful attraction of singapore with the variety and abundance of flowers and cactii. The icing on the top was the christmassy snowy red white decorations which added the aura. FLOWER DOME CLOUD FOREST highly recommend,,
,,Very beautiful.,5,,Worth going to the flower dome and cloud forest. Not many tourists during weekdays. The temperature in cloud forest is a bit low.,,
,,Amazing,5,,One of the reason why we decided to have a stopover holiday in Singapore. This place was awesome. Enjoyed our visit here.,,
,,Cloud Forrest is Nice,5,,"We took an Uber from the hotel, paid approx. $40 USD per person to go through both the Flower Garden Dome, Cloud Forrest (waterfalls), and sit through the Christmas light show that started at 7:45pm. We got there at 4pm and found the place extremely busy. The nicest and most interesting was the cloud Forrest dome with the waterfalls. All the dome windows wear fairly 鈥渄irty鈥? So made it difficult to take good pics of the bay.

Christmas show was okay, but not worth the struggle of people, waiting for Uber/cab to leave at the same time, and SWEATING... it is hot, even in December.",,
,,Awesome place,5,,Gardens by the bay was a fantastic place to go with so much colour and vibrancy. We went with reasonable expectations and it exceeded everything we thought. Make sure you have your walking shoes,,
,,Breathtaking,5,,Gardens by the bay is a must visit ! Such a beautiful concept and such a relaxing place. You can walk around take pictures even eat on top and have drinks at one of the restaurants . I would inquire for reservations in advance with so many visitors to this attraction . Wear comfortable shoes it鈥檚 a large space and they have so much to see so bring a bottle of water and enjoy,,
,,"Its so TOURISTY but, so WORTH IT!!",5,,"This beautiful spot is a must visit while in Singapore. Vast green lands with beautiful flora and calming water bodies. located right on the Marina Bay under the Marina Bay Sands. It has 2 conservatories, The Flower Dome and The Cloud Forest. along with the Super Tree Sky walk all need a ticket but its has a vast outdoor gardens which are free to walk around. The Flower Dome is a beautiful sight to visit. It houses some of the rarest and beautiful plants and trees that are beautifully laid out as per their geographic locations.",,
,,Don't MISS!!,5,,"It is an engineering and maintenance marvel. There is a bit of walking and climbing involved, for the most part however there are buses and lifts available. Around Christmas the domes are converted into wonderlands. One of the must dos in Singapore.",,
,,Excellent attraction for families,5,,We arrived at night for the light show and also to try the satay stalls within the grounds. We really enjoyed the gardens and the food in the stalls.,,
,,Best Nature Park,5,,"This is no doubt best rated place in Trip Advisor for Singapore. The obesrvatories esp Cloud Forest we're awesome. First cover up them and then move to Supertree cove with OCBC skyway in evening and a laser with music show in night. We enjoyed Christmas wonderland too, though not worth extra money as the usual stuff with expensive things. Enjoy instead the garden and walk around the heritage gardens",,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,Great Place. worth a visit. Will require at least 3 hours to be spent here. It is some place I would suggest one can visit inSinpaore,,
,,Below expectation...,3,,Travel to Singapore few times and finally decided to visit this place. Had high expectation as it is highly recommended through the review. Cloud forest- nothing much and don't see much plants or specialty at this place except to que long line to go up 7 level to the top of the indoor water fall and walked down through the bridge and the midst release every 2 hours. Flower dome - don't see a lot of flora n fauna even there are a lot of different gardens. Almost everyone keep taking photos of the decorations instead of getting know the plants which may not be common - as there wasn't any special plants to get to know. I visited botanical gardens in north Thailand and this is far much disappointed.,,
,,Brilliant and wonderful,5,,"Though we visited on Christmas Eve with lots of ppl, to place was buzzing and in the evening when the lights went on it was a beautiful sight and lot of fun all around. Over all very well managed except the entry to the skywalk in cloud forest where there was no management of queues. The skywalk was wonderful so was all the trees and flowers. Definitely worth a visit. Prefer to visit in second half and keep at least 4-5 hours to cover and enjoy everything.",,
,,Must do!,5,,The Garden by the Bay is a must do attraction in Singapore. It鈥檚 so beautiful and you have all those different sections. You can easily spend a full day.,,
,,Very nice,5,,"We went there in the evening, but unfortunately because of Christmas, they blocked off the light garden for the carnival so we couldn鈥檛 access, but still able to enjoyed the light show which was spectacular",,
,,Interesting attraction,4,,"We enjoyed our visit th Gardens by the Bay. Because of it was a holiday, it was quite crowded, but well managed. It was not a visually stunning as the National Orchid Garden. We especially enjoyed walking the immense outdoor space.",,
,,Really surprising!,5,,"I thought this was going to be just another botanic garden, but the giant indoor gardens and mountains we鈥檙e really fun! The waterfall mountain was a huge surprise and the tree top walk had some great views. Pleasantly surprised!",,
,,"Some good bits, some not so much",3,,"Positives were the two domes and the shuttle bus service to get our around the park in the rain/if you are not able to walk. The tree towers looked amazing but rain meant visiting them wasn鈥檛 possible.

The sky bridge being closed due to rain was understandable but lack of signage or info about it was disappointing",,
,,Unique display,4,,"Cloud Garden very interesting. Indoor waterfall, was a long queue to get into. Very well done. Dissapointing that had to pay to go on walk in supertree grove. Had Christmas village, was very good. Had lunch & dinner at Satay by the Bay. Good cheap hawker food",,
,,WOW!,5,,"Incredible experience. Absolutely beautiful, the creations, decorations and arrangements of scenery are mesmerising. A must must do for visitors to Singapore! Never been to a place so large that is air conditioned so it鈥檚 also a pleasant relief from the outside humidity.",,
,,Gardens by the bay,5,,Must see this was the most amazing experience and totally free. We lay on the ground in the balmy air to watch this. You need to get there early,,
,,A must see!,5,,"I visited during Christmas 2017, it is beautiful. Really something to behold at this time of year especially with the Christmas decorations- lights, trees etc .",,
,,A World Class Garden,5,,"A must-visit attraction suitable for all ages, which could occupy you a full day if you have the time to visit all the gardens and exhibits. Went there with my family and visited the OCBC Skywalk among the Supertrees, and the 2 cooled conservatories (Cloud Forest and Flower Dome). The towering Supertrees are planted with real plants and is designed to mimic the ecological functions of a tree. The Cloud Forest features a lush-green Cloud Mountain, which is awesome with the waterfall and tree-top walks. The Flower Dome, on the other hand, features numerous flowers and plants from the Mediterranean and semi-arid subtropical regions. Other than enjoying the spectacular views and the exhibits, there's also a lot of educational materials to explain about the plants and their living habitats, as well as the importance in conserving our environment.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,"There are two domes that you can visit and it has a beautiful man-made waterfall. Look out for festive season specials as the dome will be decorated according to the festivities. Since both domes are sheltered, you can visit it during rainy days.",,
,,Wonderful,5,,No need to get shuttle service inside the park. Walking takes short time and there are many things to see on the way. Entrance tickets can be bought at the airport or in internet.,,
,,Malaysian n Taiwanese frens鈥?visit,5,,Beautiful Christmas scene with the cool temperature Inside the two bays like spring weather. Our Malaysian n Taiwanese friends enjoyed their visit there,,
,,Brave the heat. Worth it.,5,,"The Gardens are set in a large tract of reclaimed land, adjacent to the Marina Bay Sands resort. It is accessible from the MBS hotel via an elevated walkway, or from the Bayview MRT station.
Not quite the traditional botanical garden, the parks set out in a number of themed sections that show off plant species and ornamental styles of these themes.
A water park section allows the younger at heart to cool off in the heat of the day if they are prepared to get wet.
There are a number of paid attractions in the Gardens including two climate controlled enclosures, one of this contains curated displays of flora from different parts of the world, and the other a wonderfull walk through an alpine environment. Both are worthwhile doing and a refuge from the heat.
The Gardens are transformed into a wonderland of lights at night - a totally different and more comfortable experience.
If you need a food or drinks break, Satay at the Bay is a hawker centre style oasis in the Gardens.
Definitely worth doing if you are stopping over in Singapore.",,
,,Interesting - set aside sufficient time for it,4,,"Do it during the day - try to time it so that you finish in the evening and are in time for the sound and light show. Reach the sound and light show area well in advance to get a nice place to sit and watch the show. It is at the Supergrove.

Avoid going in the night time, especially if you want to click photos in the Flower Dome.

You will have to buy separate ticket to enter the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest. The Cloud Forest is certainly worth a visit and one can easily spend a couple of hours in it.",,
,,Good park,5,,Singapore is creative. Many replicas are meticulously made. Better to go with a group. Yeach good to go for maximum twice. More than that you will be boring.,,
,,Amazing trip,5,,"Staff were helpful at the entrance in getting the tickets. Beautiful landscape and it is interesting to see the different plants and flowers at the huge ""glasshouse""",,
,,Fairy tale garden,5,,Beautiful fairy tale garden. It is big we only visit the cloud forest. Nice garden architect with exoctic flowers.,,
,,Good but feel artificial,4,,"Awesome engineering. Prefer the cloud garden conservatory which was cool compared to the other one. But I still prefer natural botanical garden. Good for families and kids though as it's fully air conditioned, considering Singapore heat. Also every extra things need to pay more, so Singaporean :(",,
,,Simply Beautiful,5,,"When we visited Singapore in 2009 they were reclaiming land for the gardens so it was nice to see them completed. They were amazing - we could not do the skyway walk in the evening as you had to buy tickets to the Xmas wonderland lazer show. But managed to get some good photos of the tree light and music show from outside the event. We returned to do the skyway walk the next day it, was $8sgd for adults and although the skywalk is not that long it was definitely worth it for the amazing views. Recommend visiting in the afternoon so you can get day & evening photos as the sun goes down. Simply beautiful.",,
,,Not to be missed,5,,"We visited the gardens when we were in Singapore five years ago and went back today.We were amazed that so much additional things have been added.The Cloud Garden is fantastic,as is the whole garden.Definately a must see in Singapore",,
,,Beautiful,5,,Came here on Christmas Day. Very busy but well worth it. Took the audio tour just to have a break from walking and heat. Stayed for the Christmas market. It was more a family event than for solo travellers. It is a very large garden so takes at least half a day if you want to visit the conservatories but can definately stay longer as it's a very pleasant environment.,,
,,Fantastic,5,,This place is amazing and well worth a visit. It is well laid out and would suggest taking time to visit this site. Brought ticket for Flower Dome and Cloud Forest both were amazing to visit. The Cloud Forest especially. You start at a lower level and as you move up the area becomes covered in a mist as if your climbing a mountain. You then take a lift to the top and then have like a treetop walk back down the various levels. My only problem was that my wife has mobility problems and going up the walkway to the Cloud Forest was that it was a bit on the steep side. Wheel chairs can be hired at entrance for the cost of $2 Singapore but have to also hand over some sort of ID which is returned to you when bring wheelchair back. Wheelchairs hired had to be returned by 830pm. This is not to miss attraction in Singapore,,
,,Holiday in Singapore,1,,Gardens by The Bay is a MUST SEE experience for everyone young as well as old coming to Singapore. Well planned layout of the two respective Domes which we thoroughly enjoyed spending time.However there was an extra entry ticket of 10 SD per person for seeing' Light & Sound Show' on 21Dec'17 which is normally free. We were told it is due to X MAS decorations. In my view extra decorations were more of a distraction while viewing the Light and Sound Show rather than helping. Extra decoration should have been put up a little distance away as a desperate event/enclosure.,,
,,Second to none,5,,"The presentation and maintenance of this part of Singapore is truly outstanding. Flying SQ internationally means Singapore stopovers are common and even enjoyable.
With attractions like Gardens by the bay Singapore will ease the pain of lengthy stopovers.
A sight worth seeing both day and night to truly appreciate the art of nature.",,
,,Beautiful!,5,,"One of Singapore's top attractions, though albeit a bit pricey, is still worth checking out. The outdoor gardens are well-manicured and should be checked out during the daylight hours. The Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome should also be viewed during the day, however the Supertree Grove should be seen in the evening as the trees light up. Overall it's a nice break from all the hustle and bustle of the city.",,
,,Magnificent,5,,So easy to travel anywhere in Singapore by the fast train. We went to the gardens late afternoon so we could see the light show. It was amazing. The man-made trees are now almost covered by real growing vines. You can take the lift up to the skywalk so you have a close up view. I don't like heights but the spectacle negates those fears. Great photo opportunity.,,
,,Like nothing you have ever seen before! Leave time to visit it also in the evening,5,,"A truly magnificent place even when it rains outside, make sure to also check the souvenir shops because they have very nice gifts. Take a cardigan for the Clouds- it could feel quite cold when entering from outside. When you are done walking around, go up via the stairs to Marina Bay Sands and you will get a panoramic view - awesome when it is dark and you can see the lights.",,
,,Don鈥檛 go during holiday season,2,,"Many people went to this place on December holiday which created long que to enter both domes and restaurant.
We just spent less than 15 minutes on each dome as we were not happy with the crowd.

I visited flower dome few month ago to see tulip flower and it was much more interesting than current exhibition , with less visitor also.",,
,,Epitomizes the modernization of Singapore,5,,"A must visit when you're in Singapore. Will recommend to go at night, because the lighting setup of the entire gardens will truly take your breath away.",,
,,Worth visiting,5,,"Worth visiting with their beautiful botanical display which changes approximately every 3 months. (Each display will be themed) Walking the the midst of beautiful botanical displays in an air-conditioned dome. Yes please!! There are 2 domes to visit (Cloud Forest dome has a waterfall). Other than the domes, you can also explore the outdoor parks in Gardens by the Bay and the supertree grove which offer light-music performances every night. Food wise, choices are slightly limited and can be abit pricey hence be prepared to spend a little more on the restaurants there.",,
,,Took my guests,5,,"Absolutely the best experience. A must do for all visitors to Singapore. The tropical forest, waterfall as well as the flower dome is amazing. I personally have visited the Gardens numerous times but it鈥檚 always exciting! The futuristic Trees are truly out of the world!! Come to Singapore",,
,,Interesting and beautiful gardens,4,,The Gardens by the Bay are free to visit if you just want to walk around the grounds. They are particularly special at night when the large 'trees' are all lit up. A relaxing place to visit and a respite from the hustle and bustle of the city.,,
,,Fabulous,5,,Gardens by the Bay is terrific. My sister and I loved our visit here. We highly recommend the cloud dome but wouldn't rush to the flower dome again.,,
,,Live up to its 5-star on tripadvisor,5,,"I was quite skeptical at first, wondering how good can a garden be, making it the top attraction of a nation. As we stepped in, we were covered by plants across different regions on the globe. I am not a flora enthusiast but I was definitely surprised by the amount of effort they put in creating this entire garden.
Be sure to visit the flower dome, cloud dome, supertree grove as well as the skyway. Buy your tickets online to avoid the long queue in peak season.
I would advise to spare around half a day at least if you wanna enjoy in a comfortable pace.
The only downside was Cloud dome, the only way to get to the top was using the elevators. We queued for about 45minutes just to get to the top using the elevator.",,
,,Christmas and Gardens by the Bay,5,,"We were intruiged to see how Christmas is portrayed and weren鈥檛 disappointed. The beauty of the gardens and the set up of the biospheres is excellent, however, it is the visit in the evening when the light displays really which you must see. Add in the Christmas sparkle, some festive music and the Giant Tree Grove really comes to life. Excellent.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,A must visit . This place is beautiful in the evenings. Located just adjacent to Marina bay sands. A very well maintained tourist attraction,,
,,Great attraction and excuse to go shopping afterwards.,4,,"Went in the summer, was hot as heck. Was worth the visit and climb up the steps to the treetops. Great views of the city. Go shopping in the mall afterwards to cool down and eat lunch!",,
,,Must see,5,,"What a beautiful place to visit. We saw both enclosures and really enjoyed them both. Lovely gift shops. Highly recommend, you get great photos",,
,,Magnificent Gardens,5,,"We did the afternoon tour and got picked up from our hotel around 2.00. They dropped you off near entrance and gave you your tickets to then explore on your own. We did the 2 domes and walked around the surrounding parks and gardens. Had lunch down at Sate by The Bay which had more reasonable prices. Be prepared for plenty of walking, so wear comfortable shoes. Will take plenty of photos and can get a very good photo of the Singapore Flyer looking across the river. Do take something warm to wear inside the Cloud Mist Dome, as quite cool inside. Do not miss the light show in Giant trees. We also walked over to Marina Bay Sands Hotel and can get some great shots of the Giant trees on the bridge. To see everything, would need a full day.",,
,,Christmas Wonderland SG,5,,"Came here on Dec 26, 2017. There's an event Christmas Wonderland SG, which is very niceeee and a must visit one when you are in SG in their Carnival periods. Santa Grotto, outdoor Wax Skating, amusements, and we can picnic under the stars just right in the centre of Gardens by The Bay ! Enjoying the lights at night with ghe Christmas songs all around. Nice one !",,
,,"Mugging at the Bay, Selfies in the way",5,,"Why does someone go to look at an outstanding botanical display and spend the whole time mugging at themselves, taking picture after picture of their face mindless of the wonderful gardens surrounding them? The Gardens by the Bay are truly unique and beautiful with a wide variety of vegetation, displays and settings. The orchids are dazzling in their variety and display. Being an owner of orchids myself, I wondered at how they had so many in bloom and on display. There must be huge greenhouses tucked away somewhere on the property where orchids that are not in bloom are kept, yet it is obvious that most of the plants are placed permenentlly. Also an army of gardeners must work at night to keep everythiing so well groomed. But it doesn't look manicured; everything looks natural in its setting. The bromeliads are also outstanding, tucked into the framework of the Supertrees, and the Conservatories are unique with their total climate control. The Cloud forest dome was my favorite with the rolling mist, full fledged waterfall and meandering pathways. Don't miss the Pollen restaurant. It is not big, but with its ""outdoor"" setting with the scent of rosemary, it is the perfect place for lunch. My only critique of the whole experience was the stream of selfie takers who seemed oblivious to what they were supposed to be looking at, and who blocked the paths with their endless posing.",,
,,Well worth a visit,5,,Great place to visit and a good place to take pictures of the city. Avoid in thunderstorms as you won't be able to visit some of the outside attractions.,,
,,Amazing!,5,,"No trip to Singapore is complete without a visit to Gardens by the Bay. What an amazing place! The plant domes were fascinating and quiet comfortable in the Singapore heat. But the highlight had to be the breathtaking evening light show, totally unforgettable!",,
,,Fauna lovers' paradise,4,,If you are looking to see the most amazing plant species from around the world then this is the best place to be. This place was decorated and decked up before Christmas - the place had a calm yet festive vibe to it. Do wait and see the light and sound show that happens at night (7:45 pm).,,
,,Unique Gardens,4,,"Thought it was over-priced when paid for the tickets, but realized it was reasonable after seeing the two covered gardens (cloud forest and flower dome). It really is worth going. The souvenir shops are great too!",,
,,Beautiful place and must go!,5,,"There are 2 conservatories that you all can see it, 1 is flower dome, the place where we could see all flowers arou nd the world, its so beautiful, the place is so comfortable because its a full air-cond, and you could enjoy a beautiful view of flowers, there is also a small restaurant inside here. We could sitting around here and not to be rush. The second one is cloud forest dome, where there is an artificial waterfall, it could wet you clothes if you come near the waterfall, inside here there is also a small museum that explain about how tropical wheather and more about Singapore wheather, but its also educative. We love it here, anyway if you plan to go here by public transport there is a shuttle buggy car service from marina bay sands hotel, go up to level 6 and walk near-by jusr 500m and you will see garden by the bay. U have to pay 3 SGD for round-trip.",,
,,MUST VISIT!,5,,"Worth visiting any time of the year especially during the Christmas holiday season where everywhere is so festive.................love the fact it is all air-conditioned and fairly cool inside (except the open area of coz). If you got kids or elderly, please bring them a light jacket just in case. If you only have time for one venue, visit the Flower Dome first (far better than the Cloud Forrest in my opinion).

After the night light show, I would suggest you to avoid queuing at the taxi stand as there was almost 100 visitors waiting in front of me last time when I was about to leave the venue on a busy Sunday night. Either take the MRT or call your own taxi (Taxis in Singapore are very professional and reliable) and wait at the taxi stand. I was in fact overwhelmed by the HUGE CROWD waiting and found myself really lucky to get into my taxi within 5 minutes.",,
,,Beautifully maintained gardens,5,,"Well worth a visit. Wear cool clothes and comfy shoes. Good toilet facilities, though it was difficult to locate the caf茅, which turned out to be a snack bar.",,
,,Great experience and lots of variety,5,,Went to both greenhouses and was amazed by the variety of plants and trees on display. Great for photographers and the Xmas decorations were grand.,,
,,Nice place,5,,"Nice experience, beautiful place., Lots of things to see, the view from top here is beautiful, nice foliage",,
,,Lovely,5,,We visited both in the day and at night time. We paid 10$ (i think) to go up to the walkway which connects the big trees and you get fantastic views of the city. At night there was a light show where they played Christmas music which was worth seeing.,,
,,Great for kids!,5,,"We loved the gardens by the bay. We went into the cloud forrest which is really beautiful. Our toddler loved the childrens water play area, i think he would have stayed all day if we let him! These gardens really are beautiful and a must visit in singapore",,
,,Nice viewing,4,,Went with my hildren and entered the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. I must say we all love the Cloud Forest more as there were many exotic plants and the trail walk was fun! Love the waterfall as it soothes each mind looking at it. We went in the afternoon. So followed by the evening view to watch the lightings at the Super Tree. Its was a fascinating view to capture.,,
,,garden by the bay,3,,"The night view was very nice, but due to too many tourists at the Cloud Forest queuing for the lifts, is a bit of wasted visiting time.",,
,,The Cloud Forest was spectacular!,5,,"The Cloud Forest was spectacular! Please don't miss it! The Flower Dome was good too, but this one was better. Can get a bit cold in places, but overall very comfortable.",,
,,Wonderful visit,5,,So much to see. Both huge domes are air-conditioned. Take the open trolley ride around the gardens to start with. Look out for that big fat baby sculpture!,,
,,Cool way to spend the day,5,,Beautiful gardens - just wished we had more stamina to stay longer. The conservatories are lovely and cool. I wasn't so keen on the suspended walkway as I am scared of heights but the view was amazing. Indochine was the only disappointment - paid $20 for a drink and there was only one choice of (mediocre) white wine and not much else happening up there - we had thought to have some lunch but there was a minimum spend of $80++ per person.,,
,,A Sci fi future you must see,5,,The cloud dome was breathtaking felt like alien landscape the backdrop of some movie. The flower dome was equally good with giant bonsai like plantations. Would love to visit again during day time.,,
,,Must visit places for plant lovers,5,,"Gardens by the bay in itself is beautiful and we spent approx 4-5 hours here excluding our tea break. My suggestion is that you plan your trip to gardens post early lunch. I understand it could be sunny but don't worry, head straight to the flower dome (it has aircon) and it might take approx 2 hours or more depending on your interest levels, next move to the cloud forest and take a stroll, it takes lesser time than flower dome and dont miss the mist show. (Note: if you wish to re-enter the domes after a break, you could get a re-entry stamp on your hand at the exit gate of respective domes). take a break and stroll around the gardens. Head to the super tree grove for the 7.45pm light show (find yourself a seat anywhere on the lawn or ground or under the supertree) and end your day with a sumptuous dinner.

Note:
plan your trip after an early lunch
time taken: 4-5 hours minimum
re-entry to dome is possible if you get a stamp
dining options are plenty(Mcd,indian,chinese, indonesian, steak and grills,etc)
dont miss the super tree light show (7.45pm/8.45pm)",,
,,Lighting during christmas is amazing,5,,We went around 4:00 pm so that we could watch the lighting show at cloud forest which takes place at 7:40. If u are someone who is not interested in going inside the domes n see whats inside and just want to take a stroll u dont need to buy a ticket. We went during the christmas week so the atmosphere inside was even more beautiful. Since it was cloudy the skway for cloud forest was closed but it was too much fun to just sit on the grass n see the lighting show take place. If u are a family with kids and u plan to go during december spend there time till 8:30 pm atleast its just amazing.,,
,,A must-visit place for locals & tourists to Singapore!,4,,"If there is one tourist spot in Singapore that you must visit, its Gardens by the Bay as its one of its kind in the world, especially for those who love plants, flowers and greenery! Been there a few times already and will still visit the place again :)",,
,,Very lovely garden,5,,Garden By The Bay is a very great place to visit with your family.The plants are all very-well-grown. You can see the most beautiful flowers blossoming in there. The toilets are all very clean. The staffs were very nice and helpful. The temperature in the garden was very comfortable. My family really enjoyed the trip to Garden By The Bay and will definitely recommend this place to all our friends and relatives.,,
,,Could be better,4,,"Not enough clear directional sign-boards, got even wrong direction from working staff resulted in a long round about. Should incorporate a local food-court rather than just fast-food outlets.",,
,,Miniature Singapore.,5,,When with a group for friends to GBB to round up the year 2017. Beautiful mamade garden by the bay. A must visit attraction if you are visiting Singapore.,,
,,Best attraction in Singapore,5,,This place is incredibly beautiful. Should be top of everyones list when visiting Singapore. Not far by taxi from Orchard Road and entry is pretty cheap.,,
,,really different and inspiring,5,,worth seeing- i avoided last three trips and now wonder why I missed this. Everyone should see it and it fits with Singapore respecting modern design and nature and mixing them well,,
,,A destination in and of itself,5,,"DO NOT MISS THIS SITE! Also, a special treat is to go in the evening and eat at Indochine on top of the supertrees. We timed it to see the first of two lights show from the restaurant and the second from the ground as we exited. It was all fabulous - especially the Cloud Forest. We also did the tram ride to start, which was fun and the Flower Dome. Wouldn't change a thing about our visit.",,
,,Fantastic idea!,5,,Something for the entire Family from four to forty-four and more..... Visiting the Flower Pavillon is a MUST!,,
,,Beautiful,5,,Lovely place brilliant for all ages. Magnificent things to see and do. Very friendly staff on hand to help,,
,,Just perfect,5,,It is the best thing i have ever see... And for kids and for adults.. Better at the night.. You must go!!?,,
,,Is a amazing place to visit,4,,"We visit flower done on 23 Dec, is Very clouded on that day. Like all the flowers, and super tree is worth to visit.",,
,,Must go !,5,,A fantastic place to spend time ! Must Stay for the light show ! Loved the OCBC SKYWAY ! CLOUD FOREST was fun !,,
,,Beautiful day in the bay,4,,"Went to the gardens during the day with our kids (4 yrs and 14 months) and had a great time. Even though there is not much for the kids to actively do inside, they were excited about the variety and colors. Also the fact that it is airconditioned is very pleasant if you want to escape the heat.
On the outside of the Gardens is a huge (water-)play area which is great for the kids to enjoy - just make sure you bring your swimwear and a towel.",,
,,Great place,5,,"Tips: buy the ticket for cloud forest & flower dome online because it is sometimes cheaper than buying on the spot, it is worth to take a shuttle cart especially if you are coming at noon because it is so humid and gonna be tiring.",,
,,Amazing,5,,"We visited this in the morning and the. Went back again to see it at night and an absolute must to see it through the day and again at night particularly with all of the Christmas lights and they also had a beautiful light show in super tree grove with Christmas songs it was amazing. You absolutely must pay the extra and do the super tree walk we did it morning and night and was worth every single penny.
The food was great there is a good selection of restaurants near super tree grove and also a great restaurant in the flower dome pollen we had afternoon tea here it was delicious.",,
,,Great Botanical Interlude,5,,"Taking my daughter to Gardens by the Bay was a great way to kill some time before flying home from Singapore. The taxi ride was economical and took us right up to the main entrance and ticket booth of the conservatories. It was also an easy walk back to the Marina Bay Sands shops after our time at the conservatories.

We visited the Flower dome and Cloud forest conservatories. The Cloud forest conservatory was the coolest so if you were pushed for time we would recommend this one as number one choice It is cooler temperature wise as well when the temperatures are hottest outside.
Beautifully maintained and packed full of many many plants. It was spectacular to see, experience and walk through.",,
,,Lovely lights,4,,Lucky enough to be here in December and the Christmas lights were really pretty and enjoyable to spend some time walking around and exploring,,
,,Breathtaking,5,,My family and I walked on the bridge of the amazing architectural columns (don鈥檛 know what to call it) and went into the flower dome. Went around Christmas time so there was very nice decorations and even took a photo with Santa! This place is a must see and my family really enjoyed the experience.,,
,,Wonderful day at Gardens by the Bay,5,,"We though this place was beautiful, interesting, wacky and fun. We spent about 4 hours and saw most of the sites, including the tree walk, outdoor gardens and the 2 domes. We really enjoyed the domes, and they are air conditioned and super cool! After, we went to their hawker stall area called Satay by the Bay and had delicious satay and chicken rice. It is $8 SGD pp for the sky walk and $28 SGD pp for both domes, we thought it was well worth it given we spent ~ 4 hours enjoying the park.",,
,,"Expensive, but nice to go through",2,,"If you like to have a walk in natural forest than you won鈥檛 like it, like us. The rain forest is nice prepared. But for 28$ per person it鈥檚 quite expensive for this place",,
,,very therapeutic at the Flower Dome..,5,,"Each time they change the flowers per the theme of the season, I will never miss it.
The variety of flowers that was brought in, its amazing to look at....and the d茅cor that goes with it...your heart just melts taking in the whole view...I really appreciate the people whose hard work goes into it. Its no easy feat, the dome is huge and the amount of time and people needed to bring the beauty to the public. Its just so fantastically amazing and the pictures you took, its just turn out so beautifully. Being surrounded by flowers, there is a feeling of calm and peace...I definitely would recommended people to go, you will not regret...",,
,,Awesome!!!,5,,I was surprised that each and every corner was accessible through wheelchair. Awesome views of nature.,,
,,great experience even if it's raining,5,,it was nice travelling here. though it was raining when we visit but the whole garden itself is a nice place to visit.,,
,,Uninformative website,2,,"As a visitor to Singapore, I did not know that there were 2 separate domes/conservatories, and that they require separate tickets. The website did not make this known, and neither did it say what the ""Christmas Wonderfland"" consisted of. The Chrismas Wonderland turned out to be utter crap, and everything in there required buying further tickets. The Gardens staff themselves were confused by the ticket types and even let us into domes we did not pay for. Very bizarre and confusing experience for everyone!",,
,,Quite exceptional,5,,Not usually my thing - but this was a really pleasant surprise. Incredible architecture and the plants are quite something. The whole Marina Bay Area is a must do whilst in Singapore.,,
,,You must visit it!,5,,This is one of my favorite place in Singapore. The great thing about it is that the awesome experiences are really different in the day time and night. The lights set up is just perfect.,,
,,Amazing experience!,5,,Both the Flower Dome and Cloud Dome exhibition was exquisite! It was an experience that i鈥檒lnever forget... the flowers were beautiful and the view was just breathtaking. It鈥檚 a must to visit if you鈥檙e in Singapore.,,
,,Excellent,5,,We all loved it. Our Grandson enjoyed it very much and it was very educative also. He got to see different flowers. Very good ambience. Spirit of Christmas was very well created giving a good photo opportunity to the children. Alice in wonderland was attractive too. Loved the flowers created by using lego. Innovative idea !!,,
,,Highly enjoyable visit,4,,"Great experience, the gardens are beautiful and site is well managed. The ecological message is really powerful. The super tree grove is the standout, we went in the evening and it was spectacular lit up in the dark.",,
,,Over crowded,1,,"Tickets were over sold leading to massive over crowding. Hours spent queueing to get into the Domes. For Cloud Forest, there was another queue to get up to the top. Noticed some plants withered due to over crowding. Management should limit the number of tickets sold per day to avoid over crowding.",,
,,Enjoyable trip,4,,A very adventurous project which is very interesting. Although a lot of plant maturity still to happen the project has 2 distinct areas which are interesting in their own right.,,
,,A nice walk,4,,"We strolled through the gardens during the evening soon after arriving in town, which was a nice way to recover from the long flight.",,
,,A must to see,3,,"Great development and wonderful location. Really nice light show. However, way too many people and had to que for an hour to enter cloud Forrest. Also the Christmas show. Far too many people and not much for the $20 charged.",,
,,Breathtaking,5,,"Not only an amazing place to visit for the plants that are on display but also the area as a whole as an engineering masterpiece
Having had a little experience trying to transplant bottle trees in Australia it was amazing to see the number and physical size they have successfully relocated
I am sure this applies to many of the speies on display
Rainforest was also spectacular and well worth the visit",,
,,A much hyped place with too much crowd,5,,"Do not expect so much from this area. They have tree kind structures with artificial lights. We didn't got much attraction, since we see all the flowers blossom in our country.

You can take a walk in the evening. Visit from outside, if you really want to spend more, then buy tickets and enjoy it. Else it can be easily skipped. There is much more good stuffs to enjoy in Singapore.",,
,,"Huge scale, average interest",3,,"Two huge gardens, both under domes. The scale of this undertaking is truly impressive. Their contents were OK, with the Cloud Forest being a bit more interesting. Not cheap to visit, but upkeep on this must be expensive. A reasonable adventure for a couple of hours, but definitely not the highlight of a visit to Singapore.",,
,,Wasn't as expected.,2,,"Not as good as my last visit many years ago. Many of the plants in the flower dome looks lifeless. Dehydrated feel. Furthermore ticketing system is too environmental unfriendly. 1 pc of A4 size per visitor, imagine 10 in the group 10 A4 size. Should start to invest in the QR code scanning system. We're talking about nature, yet we start to help in the destroying of nature even before our visit. Wrote to the Management, but received chap and contradicting answer.
Anyway my visit is family with older folk. Pls put that in the sort of visit too.",,
,,Exotic Flora Fauna Retreat,5,,"There is a entry ticket, washroom facilities available, approx. min time 2-3 hours, taxi from any point in singapore is available, you can later walk down to marina sands hotel too if you want.",,
,,Nice and Relax,4,,Nice and Relax. Walk and see many flower. When afternoon can walk inside cold room. Night walk at garden waiting show at 745pm.,,
,,Christmas wonderland,4,,For the food vendor we could have use cash instead of changing it into voucher to pay for the foods.,,
,,Lotsa pretty flowers,4,,Everywhere is beautiful exvept that it is a bit packed at christmas wonderland. Some of the staff do not have answers when i asked about the services.,,
,,Avatar of singapore,5,,This is the most amazing gift from the singapore government to its people. The best time to see the magic is in the night when the super trees are light up especially during Christmas and Chinese New Year in December and February respectively. Bright your love ones for a romantic magical night!,,
,,Greatness making my mother happy,5,,"If staff going around telling people no fd/drinks, they shld voluendeer helping ask throw our trash.",,
,,Incredible artificial gardens,5,,We where kind of blown away with this place. It's a 'must visit' in Singapore. Indoor rainforest with a lot of beautiful orchids and plants from all over the world in the other dome... We talk about 15 meters high trees and cactuses etc... Just an astonishing place to visit,,
,,Complimentary ticket,5,,It鈥檚 a must but I got the ticket with my package. They picked us up at the neighbouring hotel and we were dropped off at the Buddha temple to be transferred to another bus. The major negative is you have to find your own way back to the hotel. There is a lot of walking involved but we took the audio tour at $8 per adult. A trolly bus took you around so was worth every penny. The skywalk is also extra again at $8 per adult or over 12 year olds. The lift takes you to the top you walk to another lift that takes you down so loved it. Walkway was a bit shaky a bits so was clinging on as not great with heights. There is a notice saying 15mins max but this is more than enough time to see everything. Complimentary ticket got us into 2 areas the cloud walk and the Forrest so loved it and would recommend.,,
,,Gardens by the Bay,4,,It was a happy and good experience. I will definitely visit gardens by the Bay again. I will bring my family there the next time.,,
,,Long Queues at Gardens By the bay,1,,"I went to Gardens by the Bay on the 24th of December with my 82 year old father to Gradens By the Bay. The number of people going to the domes were incredibly huge. GBTB should have a quota on the no. of people allowed in the domes within a specific time so that family could wait outside and enter the domes within a timing of 1-2hrs per dome. Old people on wheelchairs should definitely be allowed first. I felt so sorry to see the officers there making very old people in wheelchairs join the 300m queue. The Cloud dome had the most horrifying queue ever! I question the safety of all people when they are up there. By the way, i go there quite often with my children and students and i have never seen GBTB so unprepared for so many people (most of them were tourists). I think it is better for tourists to have a safe and beautiful image of Singapore than a bad memory of long queues at the garden.",,
,,Great view,5,,"A great place for people of all ages. Went to the Flower Dome, Cloud Forest and the annual event, Christmas Wonderland. Cloud Forest was awesome with the mist appearing around evening. The scenery view was great.",,
,,Cloud Forest and Flower Dome,5,,Cloud forest was the better and worthwhile because it was so fascinating and amazing. Flower dome was interesting but the paled in comparison.,,
,,Public transportation for elders,4,,"Great place to visit except for the crowd during the festive season. A small public transport will cater well for the elderly, as we have noticed our travel companion wanted a quick ride back to the car park area after the visit.",,
,,Cool,4,,The 2 domes are super cool...i love how they arranged the plants by regions where it belongs...nice to have a place like that...good also for preservation...,,
,,Fun for all ages.,5,,"I went for Christmas Wonderland.
This event is fun for all ages including a lot of attractions for small kids and older kids, food and drink (and alcohol) for grown ups.
Only downside is that the people love the event so much that it gets too crowded.",,
,,The flower Dome and the cloud forest,4,,"We were there on a Saturday. There were lot of visitors. Queue to enter both areas were very long. However, surprisingly time taken to queue was shorter than we expected.

Both the flower dome and cloud forest were very cooling. For those who were afraid of coldness, bring along jacket or shawl. The flowers and plants in both areas were unique and beautiful and we had enjoyed this visit very much, especially at the flower dome.",,
,,Lots of fun during Christmas time,5,,My 3.5 year old had a lot of fun. She loved the Chrtimas carnival as there was so many activities for her age as well.,,
,,Feedback,5,,The aircon was much too cold for both domes. Especially so for the forest dome. Stairways should have more foot lightings especially at the final ascending at the forest dome. Tks.,,
,,Spectacular,5,,Spectacular infrastructure and exhibits. Well decorated and stunning lighted effects. Awesome site for family enjoyment.,,
,,Great place,5,,"Nice place to visit with your love one. Has nice food too in the garden, best to visit when there is an event like Xmas.",,
,,Christmas wonderland,2,,"The program is not old aged aided. There is only one small entrance and it was long queue. My mum was on wheel chair and it is difficult to push her thru. At the end, I forgo to go in to the xmas wonderland. Worst there is only one entrance if you bought the package deal. Trying to go thru the satay by the bay entrance but was stopped as I need to go to the the flower dome first to redeem the wonderland ticket. So inflexible, rigid and not user friendly. Why can't we enter using the online ticket since it was already stated there. Pls consider all these issues and feedback so that your customer will have a more pleasant trip during this festive season. Another point, the wheel chair rental is till 9pm instead of the closing time, why?? why there is no Family with old people selection below?",,
,,Visit in Christmas,5,,"Two gardens are very beautiful. We met Santa in the garden and took a photo with him.

We also walked in OCBC walkway at night. It is so amazing that the view is very beautiful!

After that, we visited Wonderland which is a Christmas party with markets for playing and eating.

My family enjoyed for our Christmas!",,
,,"A ""MUST SEE"" for all",5,,"Gorgeous, and for the time of the season that we went, it appeared somewhat magical as well. The holiday spirit was alive and the Christmas songs were synced into a wonderful light show.",,
,,Beautiful atmosphere to stay in for enjoyment.,5,,Both places were very beautifully arranged for strolling and air around was fantastic. Will definitely recommend to friends for more visits. Cheers.,,
,,Absolutely Breathtaking!,5,,The detail and beauty of this place is absolutely magnificent! I have never seen anything like it before! If you are coming to Singapore you must take at least a few hours out of your day to walk around these gardens and take it all in! Incredible beauty in the middle of amazing architecture. It鈥檚 simply amazing.,,
,,"christmas wonderland,flower dome,cloud dome",4,,"Tje two dome is good and nice,just upset with the christmas wonderland wasnt able to have info that everything must pay inside,maybe expecting too much",,
,,Astonishing!,5,,"Absolutely beautiful, well done Singapore! It's a must see for all, whether a child or the more mature child, it's unique, captivating and stunning. Take your camera, so much to capture.",,
,,Xms wonderland,3,,Flower dome was average. Wonderland food fare was mostly junk food. Could have done better w healthier choices. Toilets- pls put up portable gd ones so that ppl need not walk so far and Q damn long,,
,,Wonderland 馃挄,5,,The ticket paid worth everything inside it. Definitely an eye catching scenes & The Garden Rhapsody was one in a million.,,
,,Number One Garden,5,,"There was my third time to visit Garden by the Bay, EXCELLENT, totally I take some thousand pictures, and put into Facebook, all of my family and friend like it very much! Next year I will visit again.",,
,,Wonderful light display,5,,Oustanding light display. We timed our walk on the skywalk to when the light display was on and it was awesome. The gardens are beautiful. I would suggest avoiding the weekends though. We went on a Saturday and it was so busy that we didn't even get the chance to go up high in the cloud dome. We waited half an hour in the line and then gave up. In fact the flower dome and cloud dome were nice if you are into plants but not worth paying the extra to see. It was Christmas time as well so I'm sure that added to the crowd but overall it's well worth a look,,
,,A must see both night and day,4,,"A taxi ride from the city centre but the tour buses stop there great site, a must see in in Singapore both day and night",,
,,breathtaking,5,,Absolutely stunning it is a dream coming true I felt that is heaven on earth. I will definitely go back and strongly recommend.,,
,,Always nice to see,5,,I went at evening and there was beautiful night light show which can delight your eyes any long you want to... It's always great to see view from distance.,,
,,Nice Place,5,,Amazing and beautiful place ever. Next time i will come back again definitely. Its a pity that i had a short time in Singapore this time,,
,,Like a rainforest,5,,I couldn't believe there was a floral forest like this in a small city/country like Singapore! Will not miss this place again!,,
,,Really nice garden,5,,"This is a really nice garden. A must visit place, do not miss it if you are visiting Singapore. I strongly recommend the visit of the place during sunset when the artificial lights are turned on.",,
,,Overrated and meh,2,,"Skip this and spend more time at the botanical gardens. It offered a good view of the casino, but apart from that was a waste of time.",,
,,Nice view!,4,,Such a nice night view! Location is not that far! We enjoyed taking pictures there! Day view is also beautiful!,,
,,Nice but not great,3,,I was honestly disappointed with my visit. It was nice but not as amazing as I had expected it to be so my review is based on the high expectations I had f枚r this place. The Cloud Forest and Skyway are both worth a visit and in my opinion the highlights. I was there during the day so perhaps an evening visit with all the lights would have improved the experience.,,
,,Domes were spectacular,5,,The two domes were both unique and spectacular. The cloud forest was our favourite. So impressive and worth the visit,,
,,Amazing View,5,,The view is amazing and when you look at the flower domes you feel like on top of the world.Do see the light show which is at the main entrance around 7pm . There is a huge artificial waterfall and elevated path .,,
,,"Not as big as you would think,",3,,"Expensive, cramped, poor signage, dispointing, is very hard to get in and out, very poor signs see you looping around and around",,
,,Christmas Wonderland,4,,Went to the Christmas wonderland to see what is it all about. It is much cheaper if you buy the tickets online rather than on-site. The lights display was magnificent but toilet facilities inside the place should be more.,,
,,Gardens by the bay.,5,,The real beauty of the gardens lie in their purpose and place in the running of Singapore. The fact that they are just amazing is also great.,,
,,Garden Garden,5,,Best and quite place. every corner is well designed and well kept. Each flower and concept takes you to a different world,,
,,Something new,4,,"The free section are advisable to visit after 5pm as it is too hot and too big especially with young kids. The supertree a not yet full with plants, maybe 1-2 years it will be even more beautiful. The have a higher entrance fees for dates between 18-31 December with a surcharge of SGD10 and tourist are not allowed to visit a single forest during those times.",,
,,A MUST SEE,5,,"The two main garden attractions are well worth doing. You can easily walk the whole park if you are mobile. Lots to do and see. Also renting an electrical scooter is a great way of seeing everything. Singapore is not cheap, bring a big bag of money. It is worth it.",,
,,Amazing,5,,"Love this place! Amazing and beautiful. It can get busy and the lines can be long, but worth going and making the effort. Make sure you have your camera as the photos will be mind blowing. You must make sure you have plenty of time as to really get this all in you need to take it slow and immerse yourself. Wear comfortable shoes and and carry water. If you get chance visit at different times of the day, as you will get a different feel and experience. It is extremely romantic too, so if you are a couple - soak in the love.",,
,,Average,3,,"Cash Weste 10+8 Dollar, Not Good when u see.. Every body saying Singapore main attraction , but I felt, IAm not happy..",,
,,Welcome to the jungle!,4,,"The truth is.

This is an absolutely huge place with loads of parks of different categories to see and move around. The Cloud forest and flower dome are very satisfying to take a stroll through and for anyone interested in botany, it's a gold mine!

Cloud forest will shoot you back in time as if visiting a pre historic jungle!

The children's water pool play area is good for kids to chill out. There are several good options and all of them are average priced. Again, there is an Indian curry house (beside Texas chicken outlet) with plenty of Indian food options, in the food court just opposite to the supertree groove.

Getting a taxi back is easy as there is a taxi stand and abiding queue.
There are several drinking water points, so just get your bottles filled instead of buying any water - walking around the huge area would require to drink lots of water.

Remember the supertree groove lights up at around 7:30pm when the sun light is completely gone - so if you want to witness that, plan your arrival at the gardens accordingly. If you some too early in the morning, you gotta stay till late evening to see the lights in the supertree.

It's a gorgeous place and the only reason I couldn't give it a five star is because it has too much of only one category (yes I know it's a garden but the heart wants more like maybe a stunning audio visual show or something idk), but all said and done, gorgeous and superb attraction!",,
,,Stunning view of the city!,5,,This place offers a stunning view of the city. The restaurant is in a glass dome-like structure - nice sunny spot for brunch/ lunch... the sea food platter and the Vietnamese rice paper rolls were exceptionally good.,,
,,Fantastic showpiece for Singapore,5,,If you do nothing else in Singapore go to the Gardens by the Bay. If you don't go into the two domes its free however the Domes are spectacular. Weekends are crowded as one would expect in a densely populated city so get there early. We've not yet been at night time but apparently even more spectacular. Lovely eateries all around the area both outside and inside the Domes,,
,,Too see Christmas Display,5,,Had a fabulous night watching the light displays. An amazing display. Also enjoyed our dinner there at the food tent.,,
,,Nature lovers..A must visit place,5,,Simply stunning ...awesome place. Both cloud forest & flower drum brings you closer to some of the natures gift that cant be found in asia. Guess a visit at night is much recommended then day time.,,
,,Must visit,5,,Gardens by the Bay is a must visit. I enjoyed the Cloud Forest experience. The misting and the walk in the mist experience is a must do.,,
,,Architecture meets Nature,5,,With the exceptional heat in Singapore it is a delight to visit the Gardens by the bay who manage to combine the delightful architecture with some amazing displays and foral delights. The boabab trees where great. Even if you have been before I would recommend returning as each time you will see something new,,
,,A must-see for anyone of all ages,5,,Visited the conservatories and Christmas Wonderland - simply beautiful attractions. I had the opportunity to sit alone (no crowds) and stare at the Supertree Grove while listening to Christmas music.,,
,,A must-go place in Singapore!,4,,"Gardens By The Bay is a perfect place for people to relax and enjoy the greeneries in Singapore. In the cooled conservatories such as the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest, you can explore different kinds of plants and flowers such as the Orchid, ferns and trees! Stay until the night for the illumination of the Supertree Grove and the entire Gardens By The Bay. I will recommend you to go around 4pm to enter the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome as it will be just nice to see it being illuminated once you finished touring the conservatories.

Do take note that the Flower Dome, Cloud Forest and OCBC Skyway will require admission tickets. The other parts are free of charge.

If you will like to have a better photograph of Gardens By The Bay at night, head towards a bridge (which connects MBS to Gardens By The Bay) above the expressway and you can take a perfect photograph of the entire GBTB.",,
,,Must see if you are in Singapore,4,,"There are 2 main domes. 1- Sky cloud was amazing. 2- Flower dome was meh. We also went to the Winter Wonderland, which was a complete waste of money.",,
,,beautiful and dreamy place,4,,"Nice place to visit, it's very big and has several parts. I decided to enjoy a walk in the free zone and was happy about it. You can go alone or with children. Located straight out of the metro station holding the same name !",,
,,"Very beautiful place, worth visit",5,,"Very beautiful place, the 2 flower domes have to visit, every few months they will decorate the flower dome with different theme, and you won鈥檛 get bored going there again and again~~~ just that a bit cold inside, remember to bring a jacket if u...More",,
,,Vacations,5,,An experience par excellence. Rain Forest and flower Dome are simply awesome and out of the world. It is very informative and educative. Well maintained and beautifully conceptualised.,,
,,Garden by the Bay,5,,"Nice christmas atmosphere, however need to make a detour as the event organised by AIA was blocked out",,
,,Beautiful !,4,,"Maybe cause the time of visit is near Christmas, the place is beautifully decorated especially the Flower Dome and Cloud Garden. So is the SuperGroove. A good place to take beautiful pictures during this season.",,
,,This is a beautiful place,5,,"It takes a good day to enjoy this beautiful place, entry is free so relax and soak up the surroundings, amazing gardens and water features well worth the effor, the kids will love the kids garden complete with splash park",,
,,Great experience,5,,There are two domes. One for plants that were from around the world the other had a mountain with a waterfall and lots of plants on the mountain. Both were very well done. I would go back.,,
,,Amazing and Free!!,5,,"Well almost all of this exceptional exhibition is free. There are a couple of domes that charge entrance. It is beautiful here. A great kids area, a Sun Pavillion,with amazing Cactus, an Aquarium. Well worth a visit",,
,,Amazing!!,5,,Truly amazing experience by the whole family. Music is wonderful and the super trees are awsome. Tip- You gotta lie down on the lawn to get full experience.,,
,,Great place to visit,5,,It's a great place with outdoor and indoor experience. The indoor domes fill with floors and trees from around the world. It's really an eye opener. Also it was a great learning for young children. While the outdoor is also great for walking around or even jogging. We truly enjoy this place very much.,,
,,Magnificently manicured gardens,5,,For us December was the perfect time to visit the gardens in Singapore just at the tail of the rainy season. The heat of the morning was tempered by the afternoon rain which refreshed the beautiful surrounds at Gardens by the Bay not that the 2 massive conservatories needed any rain. The Flower Dome and Cloud Forrest are like 2 climate controlled glass bubbles the size of a small suburb that contain amazing flora displays with combinations of botanical and everyday descriptions that keep your interest at every turn. The elevated boardwalks are spectacular and seem to be accessible even for those who need mobility assistance. Lots of photo opportunities for the shutterbugs. We did the Flower Dome in the morning and Cloud Forrest in the mid afternoon. We broke up the sessions with lunch at Marina Bay Sands about 20 minutes walk from the Gardens shuttle stop and is close to the Bayfront MRT station. We paid about $SG85 at Changi Recommends store at the airport on arrival and that included entry to the 2 conservatories at Gardens and a 1 day entry to Universal Studios. The Christmas lights were also on display at the Gardens though we didn鈥檛 get time to schedule that in. A good reason to save that for another visit next December.,,
,,A must see if visiting Singapore,5,,"While the super trees are the shopfront of Gardens by the Bay, there is a lot more to this famous attraction.
Allow plenty of time to take the "" tram"" ride through the grounds to get a feel for the place and to hear about the various themed areas. While you need to pay for this ride, it is well worth the expense. You can then decide which parts you particularly want to visit on foot at your leisure and I strongly recommend you do this.
Follow this up with visits to the two domes and if possible get back after dark to enjoy the light show which happens three times each night.",,
,,Beautiful holiday decorations,5,,Be sure to see the holiday decorations and nightly lights and music show in the super trees. Love how they decorate for Christmas!,,
,,Excellent collection of plants,5,,Awesome place to spend half a day or the entire day and stroll through this wonderful attraction. Plus points are great resting areas and easy access to FnB outlets to refresh ourselves before continuing the walk.,,
,,Christmas @ Garden by the Bay,4,,"I was impress by the decoration. My kids love the ""snow"" and the light show that was present by Garden by the Bay.",,
,,It is not worth to visit even if it is free,2,,"You have to buy ticket of 28 SGD per person to visit The Cloud Garden and Flower dom. They are to artificial. It is like education place for student come and get to know about the plantation. It is not gaden at all as it can not combined tropical garden with stell structure....

I have been in Chinese and Japanese gardens in Singapore. It is much worth to visit, not the Garden by the Bay

However I appreciate the SG Government efforts to make Singapore to be attractive with more and more sightseeng spots but Garden by the Bay is not worth to visit

There is not enough restaurants or eating places to eat and relax. It is like place with full backpackers visitors",,
,,Lovely place to visit,4,,Went there today with the family. Staying in Marina Bay Sand Hotel so walked to it. Was a long walk but was worth it. Beautiful place to visit in Singapore.,,
,,Spectacular,5,,Unbelievable that such beauty exists and huge appreciation and admiration for those who designed and look after the gardens . Mind boggling how huge the place is .,,
,,Christmas wonderland,4,,"Went there to visit the Christmas wonderland this year. It was quite a nice experience. The lights and atmosphere were great! The Christmas market concept was really fun.
However, just a caveat is that the entry ticket of $10 was abit overpriced as there wasn't as much to see. The cost of drinks were quite unreasonable too! $4 for a bottle of water at Savour's was a bit much in my opinion.

Overall had a nice time though, the later we stayed, the more people came and the atmosphere was great :)",,
,,Must visit place in SIngapore,5,,It is just outside Bayfront MRT station. Easy to reach and spend time under greenery. Sky walk is also available which is chargeable.,,
,,Winter Wonderland on Xmas Eve,5,,Visited late in the afternoon on Xmas Eve with family. Ice skating not really a worthwhile purchase at $8 each for young children. Rides were bought using tokens and pricey especially dodgems as children were refused riding individually although tall enough! Walk along the skyway was good at dusk as Xmas lights came on - at an additional cost. Music and lights good.,,
,,Place for garden lovers,3,,"We visited the place as it was one of the major attraction in Singapore, however the place is nice and pleasant. My personal belief is that the garden and plant lover will love this place more. Otherwise it is average place",,
,,Great place,5,,"This is a great places to go in Singapore , 2 types of Conservatories, 1 with waterfall and all types of plants another is all types of flowers . There was an outdoor garden for children to play in the water and is for free. There was an OCBC SKYWAY to see the whole Singapore scenery. This a must go places in Singapore",,
,,Wow,5,,"Light show on the trees are something you will remember for a long after. From time to time they change the show, so it can never be boring.
My personal opinion - no need to go to the bridge - the better place the ""balcony"" on the opposite side.",,
,,best place on singapore,5,,i would say after sentosa and universal studios gardens by the bay is the best place to visit in singapore. what a beautiful place on this planet to visit. ij enjoyed this place and it is so wonderful to experience this place. if u dont go to this place if you r in singapore then u have to come back again to check it again..,,
,,Beautiful,5,,"The first step I entered this place, the word I could ever said is ""Beautiful"". No wonder if this place got #1 on TripAdvisor. This place is very huge. There are cloud forest, flower dome and super tree grove. It's good to come here at the day time, so we can see all the view from the top. Highly recommended place if you visit Singapore. xoxo",,
,,essential for every visitor to Singapore,5,,"Gardens by the bay are exceptional. Begin by taking the buggy tour around the gardens so you can become oriented whilst developing an understanding of the entirity of the garden. The domes are incredible and well worth visiting. The display in the Flower Dome changes with different displays possibly due to the season, whereas the Cloud dome is fairly constant. The super tree sky walk is also worthwhile you get a good view of the city and the super trees are up close. As yet I have not made it up to the cocktail bar at the top of one of the super trees. The evening light show is free and well worth seeing. I suggest going late afternoon. Do the buggy tour, go into the domes, eat at the satay by bay, take in the grounds, do the sky walk around 6.30 pm, relax either at the bar for drink or at the super tree area for the first light show at 7.45 pm sharp.",,
,,Garden,4,,Lovely place to be in. Mostly air-conditioned. My friends' wedding photography was a success. Beautiful,,
,,Love it,4,,"I love the Christmas Wonderland and the beautiful settings in Cloud Forest , it was really beautiful and magical",,
,,Delightful for exploration,4,,"We visited the Gardens by the Bay on our first day to Singapore - so our impressions are those of four jet lagged travellers. We enjoyed the visit, but I felt that both the Flower Garden and the Cloud Garden were a bit overpriced, too crowded and too long (you had to follow a path through the display). Despite that, the gardens are exceptionally well cared for, beautiful and stunning to see. Such attention and thought has gone into the displays and they are well worth checking out.",,
,,Splendid,5,,"We came here one morning, shortly after opening time which proved to be a sensible move as we avoided the selfie obsessed hordes!
The main attractions are the two ginormous domes, guaranteed to impress both young and old as you spiral from top to bottom admiring the views and myriad plant formations.",,
,,Christmas holiday,5,,"Awsome adventure, so much to explore, displays of plants from all over the world. Educational as well, great balance of information and ease of access for all. First time in three visits we were able to get on the sky walk, thunderstorms on the previous visits meant it was closed.",,
,,Amazing,5,,That was really really awesome place to see ...! Do not missing that place if u go there ....! U can see what u never in your life ...!,,
,,"Great Cloud Forest, Unimpressed with Flower Dome",4,,"I visited Gardens by the Bay on 2 March 2017 with a friend. This place is one of main tourist attractions in Singapore so I had to go. First, I went to Flower Dome. It is said that at the time we visited, was the time when the flowers bloom. However, there weren't lots of flowers that were blooming, I found several flowers that are dying. I didn't see tulips at all. There weren't a lot of beautiful flowers to be photographed then we went to Cloud Forest. The place was breathtaking since we could feel the forest vibes in the dome. I fell in love with the giant waterfall inside the dome. Then the next day, we watched the Garden Rhapsody for free at night. It was amusing.",,
,,Eco Garden,4,,"Everything here is awesome as is very eco friendly, you should visit the 2 domes which is the cloud and the flower, the flower dome is really amazing with all sort of different flower which you don鈥檛 normally get to see outdoors in Singapore.
You can even not see the domes (not to spend money), you can take a walk around gardens by the Bay. It鈥檚 wonderful.",,
,,One of memorable places for many years,5,,"Plan your time properly if travelling with small kid(s) no to miss the night at garden by the bay. Very nice place to spend the time and having resturants and facilities at nearby. Kids can play with water in a nicely arranged park with water fountain near a coffeeshop (bring towel or by from the cofeeshop). No entrance fee and at night you can enjoy light and soing dancing on avatar form giant tree. A must see in Singapore.
The downside was (at day we were there) extremly noisy fighter jets flied many many times over the park.",,
,,Wonderful,5,,Gardens by the bay is marvolous place and must visit destination in Singapore. It is amazing to see how an artificial jungle has been creted and wonderfully maintained.,,
,,Lame Lame Lame WinterWonderland,1,,"Wasted SGD10 per person visiting. The lights looked like leftovers from Deepalvali, the so called snow wonderland are a few weak shots of bubbles hardly passable as snow. No mist fans , poor lighting at night, lame Christmas songs & insufficient crew for crowd control. Don't waste your money or time here if you are travelling to Singapore for Christmas. Lame !",,
,,Great spectacle,5,,Consists of two different parks...flowers and typical gardens...nxt to marina bay hotel....sky walk is awesome...and the fare offers a lot for my 5 yr old,,
,,Favourite place.,5,,I'm a Singaporean who love Gardens by the Bay. Nice place to chill out and blank out. Good place for tourist. A must go place for all,,
,,Amazing views by night,5,,"It is one thing not to be missed in Singapore.
It鈥檚 like being Alice in Wonderland.....
the garden is impressive and although it鈥檚 all artificial but the creative minds of the designers would leave you breathless. It opens till 10:00 pm so if you are planning a trip to this beautiful country make sure you visit the gardens. It鈥檚 definitely worth your while",,
,,"Great Surrounding, nice for a walk and small bite",5,,"Good place for a run, or walk, nice views, great landscape and plenty to do. We have a corporate get together at the small food center and it was super enjoyable and good to have great Singapore food. The walk after dinner was adventurous as it was getting dark, and did find my way out in the end.",,
,,Fantastic place to spend many hours,5,,"We spent many hours in the gardens and walked everywhere. If visiting Singapore, these gardens are not to be missed.",,
,,An interesting place to visit while the sun is up,3,,"Pros-
* Usually the weather is either too sunny or rainy in Singapore. Since the place is covered it becomes more attractive.
* Having visited the concrete jungle around, the flowers and greenery is a welcome
* Will make your visit refreshing no matter when you go.

Cons -
* Gets boring if you are not fascinated by flowers
* Requires you to walk so if you have elderly people. It would take longer than usual and eventually turn difficult

If you are in Singapore around Christmas, there is a wonderful Christmas Wonderland carnival taking place. For S$10 it is a must visit.",,
,,Christmas Wonderland,5,,"I went to Garden by The Bay when there is Christmas Show, The light and decoration are good, but I expect more Christmas experience rather than just decoration and line up for take a photo. The Christmas decoration at conservatory is better than Christmas wonderland.
But overall it was amazing, later I will bring my elder family to go here.",,
,,Nice indoor garden,5,,I will come to Singapore again to visit garden by the bay!!! It is my first time to visit and they have huge place.. Please come with comfort shoes or sandals (please don't use high heels),,
,,Nice,4,,"A great place for family and kids, MRT direct access yet get ready for walking a bit if you want to see everything or hub to their trams at a cost",,
,,Beautiful walk in nature,4,,"Beautiful landscapes, well maintained. Do consider suitable clothing, shades and lots of bottled water as it can get hot during late mornings to midday. Get on the tram ride to enjoy an overview of the place, then decide whether you'd like to get entry tickets to the actual conservatories or just walk around the general park which is free but just as pretty. Tram rides last for about 20mins with English guide (recorded).

Tips for children - bring extra clothing as the park for kids have water fountains and you will get wet! :)",,
,,Unusual Gardens,4,,"Went through the Gardens by the Bay on a recent visit to Singapore, took advantage of a guided motor tour of the general gardens, which was good to give you context of the gardens. Then followed a ticketed walk through the Flower Dome and the Clour Forest which are a must and exciting. The ambience and detail of these features, including the waterfalls are amazing. You can then make your way to Satay by the Bay for a meal at a group of street stalls to give you a real flavour of Singapore. The day ends with a light show in the man made trees which is an exhilarating experience to complete the day. You can then make your way to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel for their Lighht Show. You should allow most of one day, into the night, to see these amazing, relatively new attractions in amazing Singapore.",,
,,Enjoy the garden of Singapore,5,,"So nice greenery with very care treatment created a good landscape , clean place with nice view , great place to relax during the day in Singapore.?",,
,,Worth it,5,,Enjoyed it immensely. Both domes are excellent and very different. The light show was also worth seeing,,
,,Gardens are very creative,5,,All seperate areas are well done. Creative and beautifully kept. Great photo opportunities available everywhere. Remember Your sun screen. It鈥檚 hot.,,
,,Superb,5,,I love this place. very nice flower and plant and most importantly it is indoor with aircond facility. a very good place to hang put with family with toddler and infant.,,

,,Surprisingly beautiful garden in the midst of the metropolis,5,,This is a beautifully kept garden. My children especially liked the rainforest garden. It鈥檚 a nice and relaxing retreat away from the busy city life! A must see when you鈥檙e in Singapore!,,
,,Fantasy in reality,5,,Best to visit wit family. Very enjoy the idea of the landscape showcase to encourage people to appreciate greens. You can see & experience lots of plants from around the world that you haven't see before.,,
,,Interesting Gardens,4,,"We visited both the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest. The Flower Dome is very beautiful and there are plants from different areas of the world- each in their own section. The Cloud Forest is a more harmonious unit. You climb to a higher altitude and feel the cooler temperatures and, as you do so, you also see the flora at the varied altitudes- 1000-2000 meters. Personally I prefer the Cloud Forest",,
,,"Nice ambience, nice experience",4,,"Nice ambence, various plants, nice cafes. I would recommend to friends visiting this place. Fairprice",,
,,Good trip,4,,This is a well developed and maintained garden. It is worth paying the rather high fee to get into all areas.,,
,,Simply Stunning at Nightime,5,,"We visited the Gardens by the Bay at night for the purpose of seeing the light show. Which meant we didn鈥檛 get to wander around and see everything. Would definitely return on another visit to see the whole area.
The night show is fabulous, music a little dated but it does match the overall family theme the show presents.
Very enjoyable",,
,,Great Gardens but Steamy Walking,4,,We wandered around these gardens on our first morning in Singapore. It鈥檚 very steamy walking and some sections have little shade but it鈥檚 still worth the effort. Perhaps early morning or sunset is the best time to beat the heat. Don鈥檛 miss the Cloud Garden - an awesome display of tropical plants and orchids in air conditioning.,,
,,Wonderful place,5,,"Enjoyed an afternoon of sightseeing at the Marina Sands observation deck, and from there wandered around the amazingly beautiful gardens and landscaping. Some of the the viewing corridors, especially from the bridges, are worth spending some time on. To think the whole complex is on recently reclaimed land just blows my mind!",,
,,Tourist,5,,The most beautiful garden experience. Very unusual with fountain show . A must do for tourists wanting to experience something different. The views from marina bay sands are phenomenal,,
,,Beautiful,5,,"Have always wanted to visit and it did not disappoint. The two dome displays were amazing and we could have stayed in them for hours.

The entire park is amazing and so well done, even my 8 year old and husband (who tires easily) enjoyed out day there.

We will be back.",,
,,Great environment loved the evenings . The Super Trees grove in the night just lights up so incredibly nice .,5,,Loved the flowers and rainforest environment inside both domes. Great for photography and the Super Trees grove is incredibly photogenic at night between 7-9pm,,
,,Very beautiful,4,,"I was quite impressed by this place, a large green park by the bay. flowers, birds are very beautiful. This place was well planned. However, this is also artificial, so sometimes you do not feel the nature of flowers very much. But overall, this is worth a visit.",,
,,Beautiful attractions to visit,5,,"Yearly visit for Christmas or visiting the flower dome when their flower season change are great! Place is really big, You will walk a lot. But it's really peaceful and beautiful to go.",,
,,Wide range and display of plants,4,,"An award winning attraction, Gardens by the Bay showcases a wide spectrum of plants species ranging from tropical forests to cool temperate climates habitat. This is a very well maintained garden and it is easily accessible by MRT (Bayfront MRT Station)",,
,,Worth visiting once,4,,Pleasure viewing such diverse Flora and fauna with friends and family! Plants are well grown just like Singapore growth over the years...keep it up,,
,,Nice walk through a large park,4,,"We entered at the south-west, and walked across the park to the supertree grove. There were interesting plants and flowers along the way. We enjoyed the Santa's village, but the supertrees were the main attraction, and we were not disappointed.",,
,,Unnatural Garden,3,,Not for bonafide nature lovers. Plants from different climates and regions stored in concrete settings do not a garden make.,,
,,"Impressive engineering, but lacks soul",2,,"Gardens by the bay is big and expansive. It tries very hard to be different and be smart.

But at the end of the day, it鈥檚 a manicured garden, with very expensive glasshouses (albeit architecturally very cool).

You can鈥檛 help think that it鈥檚 overpriced and directed at tourists

It didn鈥檛 do anything to inspire me",,
,,Sensational,5,,"Don't visit Singapore without going to the Gardens by the Bay. An outstanding exhibit in every way. Stunning architecture and breathtaking flora. Perfectly presented in climate controlled comfort with easy to navigate walkways. Despite the large numbers of visitors it was still possible to take time to examine in detail the wonderful variety of plants, flowers, shrubs, trees and artworks from around the world.
Will most certainly return next time in Singapore.",,
,,Beautiful park,4,,"Head down to Gardens by the bay for children to run Free in this big park. There鈥檚 a free light show daily in the evenings. A bit crowded on weekends and holidays. Still, a good place to bring visitors. You may enter the park for free, or explore the other gardens which you have to pay.",,
,,Fresh (pun absolutely intended) experience every visit,5,,"As a local, I've visited the Gardens 4 times in the past year to show overseas guests around, and I still find it extremely enjoyable. The Seasonal and Festive exhibits means that you get to see some different things with each visit, and even the regular sections in the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are enjoyable, as you get to see good representations of plants from different parts of the world (The African Baobabs are my personal favourite).

The Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are air-conditioned to maintain the temperature required for certain plants, so it's a really comfortable stroll without feeling all icky in the humidity. Perfect for the whole family, or even as a romantic yet casual first date idea. ;)",,
,,Amazing,5,,"If a city is going to do something with reclaimed land, this is a model of how to do it. The gardens are fantastic for adults and there's a children's garden with a water play area that should keep them happy for ages. As well as the open air gardens, there are two domes- welcomingly air-conditioned- one planted with gardens from around the world and the other the Cloud Forest. This has a very impressive waterfall at the entrance and as well as the planting there is information about Singapore's green approach. However, it was the Supertrees that were the main attraction for me and I wasn't disappointed. They are planted steel structures and it is possible to wander at 20m between some on the Skywalk and I'd part with the 10$ or so to do it again in a heartbeat. If you go to Singapore I'd set aside half a day to wander around this area. And if you like you tech, try the driverless shuttle!",,
,,Beautiful garden,5,,You can rent a bike for free there. Beautiful trees and flowers and fountains. You can walk all the day there.,,
,,Holiday,5,,This is a must visit when in Singapore. It has the world's largest glass greenhouse called the flower dome.There is also the cloud forest and then the skyway and super tree grove! Absolutely awesome!,,
,,Highlight of our stay,5,,"There鈥檚 really no way to adequately explain the attraction and if fact, we almost didn鈥檛 go. Seeing the Supertrees throughout the park alone would make it worth the trip but there is so much more to see and explore. There is no way you can really see this park in one day and in fact there are three distinct parks in this one location. The Cloud Forest is just spectacular which upon entering, the worlds largest indoor waterfall just takes your breath away both with the sounds of the powerful falls and the beauty. It stopped us dead in our tracks! When we finally started our exploring there it was sensory overload with mountain views with so many varieties and species of vegetation and floral displays, all seen with an almost magical veiled mist. The trail takes you from the floor level entrance up to the top of the mountain with view stations all along the way. The next place to visit there- The OCBC Skyway in the Supertree Grove where your walk provides an up close look at the incredible man made futuristic creations from this aerial walkway. This whole walkway is a photo op extravaganza. Seen in the evening is even more spectacular as there is a free light and sound program. Incredible! This review only represents a part of what this park offers but after two days of visiting, we just ran out of time. We would go back in a heartbeat!",,
,,Great for the light show at 7.45,4,,Fabulous light show especially atm as they have Xmas extra lights. Worth going to see. Better view of light show from the ground rather than from skypark.,,
,,Overall good,4,,Christmas area was not in the expected level. It was not worth for money. We had to pay separately for events,,
,,Excellent- especially at Christmas,5,,"We visited in the day and at night. We saw the Christmas wonderland which included carol singers, the light rhapsody and a snow blizzard. Excellent value for money. Great for families, couples, everyone really. We did the skywalk too which was also really good. Would definitely recommend.",,
,,Nice artificial park to enjoy with kids,5,,It's a Nice artificial park to enjoy with kids. Easy access by mrt and can enjoy the light show if you time it.,,
,,Beautiful place to visit,5,,What an amazing place to visit. The Christmas theme was so well done. It is really easy to lose a few hours walking around in the air conditioned dome. It is so well set and very informative. This is the second time we have been there and would definitely go back,,
,,Awesome,5,,Have seen this twice now . Will go again . I love it so much . It is so pretty and amazing to see. I love the big trees . The light show was awesome at night .,,
,,A must visit for flora lovers,4,,"Well the Gardens by the Bay have primarily a flower Dome and a cloud forest.the sun flower Dome is an effort to bring about a variety of flowers all under one room, although it fails in its attempt if you compare it with the miracle garden in Dubai,but however they have tried to bring different species of flowers which are very exotic and otherwise not very commonly seen. if you are a flower and plant lover then the next stop which is the cloud forest is definitely a place to be seen. You are welcomed by a huge waterfall at the very beginning. lifts take you up to the top from where you come down looking at the exotic flowers and plants that have been so magically created all over the place. there is a particular misting time when the whole place is misted and it feels as if you are walking amongst the clouds.there are many bridges and walking paths from where you walk down till the bottom.this whole place has been magically created and is a must visit place in Singapore",,
,,Great experience,5,,Amazing to see such diverse Flora and fauna! The numerous plants are so well grown that it reminds me that Singapore is a disciplined City 馃榾 very well maintained,,
,,Christmas garden at the Bay,5,,Its the most beautiful place to be in when you are in Love or just lookinf for outdoor fun and Beauty. Just so pleasant and colourful every direction you turn. Pretty flowers so grand so fresh and crispy seems like you are in Fairyland. Plenty of walking indeed for the young at heart but lifts and wheelchairs make it a very family friendly outing. Such glorious colourful flowers that you have to keep clicking photos. Its real worth spending a day and admiring all the beauty around. Theres a special place where Santa Claus is riding along and is willing to pose with us too. Amazingly merry christmas and a ver Happy New Year nostalgic feeling.,,
,,"Peaceful, tranquil and beautiful",5,,"Had 2 hours spare before my flight back home so spent one hour at the Gardens, obviously not enough time but had read reviews and just had to visit even if it was only for an hour. Stunning gardens, plants and bird life. Next visit will ensure a full day here to totally appreciate it.",,
,,Underwhelming,1,,"We felt we had to go and see this as one of the top tourist sights in singapore but were ultimately underwhelmed. We went at night time when it wasn't crowded with other people and were glad we did, as we wouldn't have wanted to be there with hoards of others during the day.

The pictures you see if this place are much better than the place itself. There are things much more worthwhile seeing in Singapore than this, especially if your time is limited!",,
,,Constantly Improving!,4,,We were there last Nov. 2017 and I was amazed that there have been updates with the place. The last time I went there was in 2014. And there were more attractions now. We were also luck to experience the Christmas themed lights and sounds show! Everything was perfect!,,
,,Singapore is a buzz,5,,Gardens by the Bay are 8 gigantic man made trees about 50 feet high covered in greenery and lit up beautifully at night and joined together with a very high walkway. In one of the trees there is a lift up to a bar which has a great view. Cloud Forest is the world鈥檚 tallest indoor waterfall. All contained in a glass green house with mist surrounding as you climb around to the top. The plants look fantastic. If you have time go the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and walk across the Dragonfly bridge over the roadway to the Gardens. (If you use the MRT alight at Bayfront and then walk across the bridge). I think 7.45 pm is the light show,,
,,Worth visiting.,5,,"Wonderful cloud forest & flower dome. The cloud forest has a beautiful hanging garden with waterfall. You can walk around this one via a skywalk.Whether you are a gardens person or not, you will not be disappointed with Gardens by the Bay. Don't forget your camera. The light show with the trees at night is a must see.",,
,,Good place to visit,5,,"This is a good place for couples, families and visitors of many ages. Although some form benefit or accessibility could be improved for the older age groups in terms of mobility and handicap access, this place is certainly memorable for years to come.",,
,,Fasinating! Never grew tired of it! :D,5,,"I am a Singaporean local. Gardens By The Bay (GBTB) is by far my most visited place of interest in my homeland. I love GBTB so much that i bought the annual pass (which allows my unlimited entry within the membership year). It has so much to offer! The Cloud Forest.... oh that spectacular manmade waterfall is the first thing you see when you enter. The place is well kept, air conditioned and lots of greenery. I felt like I was in the cooling rainforest of our own. Flower Dome is another fasinating place! You learn about new flowers/ plants. Be wow-ed by how some the flowers/ plants looked. There are benches in both the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome, where you can rest your feet, feel the coolness of air and enjoy the scenery:) If you have extra budget, do pay for the OCBC Skyway. It's a outdoor bridge where you can overlook GBTB as well as spectacular scenery of the marina vicinity. It is a highly recommended place for visit for all ages- be it you like the outdoor or the indoor (which you have to pay for the entrance fees). Do come and enjoy the place:) Have fun! (by the way, it is usually cheaper to purchase GBTB tickets online)",,
,,Garden by the bay....good place to relax in air conditioned,4,,conditioned city garden. Best time between 5 to 8pm with evening sunset and special Christmas lightings,,
,,The Jewel of Singapore,5,,"The Gardens is a lovely cooling retreat from the heat and humidity. Particularly love the Flower Dome with its different displays of the year. This year's Savour Wonderland was also a nice addition, though the ticketing side needs to get their staff familiarised with the procedures.

That said, I simply love coming to the Gardens again and again!",,
,,Wow Gardens by the bay,5,,"A must for any visitor to Singapore, this is a truly spectacular place to visit. It could easily be renamed 'Art Gardens by the Bay' because my family loved all the art everywhere as much as the plants. The two glass enclosures are works of art in themselves and their contents - jaw dropping: the Cloud Gardens in particular. Truly superb. The light show was well worth a viewing too. Only downside? The kids cafe: 1) shuts at 6pm (a bit bonkers when you're taking a family to the evening light show) and 2) only served spicy curry the evening we were there. Nuts! A minor blemish on an otherwise stellar experience.",,
,,Amazing,5,,A must do to suit all ages. We were amazed!!! It was pouring rain when we were there so this was a great stay dry activity. Loved the message at the end of the cloud dome. Didn't expect such an enormous area to be air conditioned. A great must do to suit all ages.,,
,,Amazingly pleasant man-made garden,5,,"As a local, i am constantly amazed by this man made garden. Theme of flowers will change quarterly and always get to acquire new botanical knowledge. A good place for kids to wonder too.",,
,,Wow!,5,,Cloud Forrest definately worth a visit stunning. Breathtaking. Gorgeous array of diffirent plants and flowers that are arranged in a beautiful and mesmerizing way,,
,,Colorful Memories,5,,Everything about the Gardens by the Bay gave me very pleasant experience. The flower dome and cloud forest are must see attractions. The grand trees were also a spectacle to watch. Dont miss the evening rhapsody light show.,,
,,Ionic landmark in Singapore.,5,,"Try to arrive at this garden by late afternoon where the weather is not too hot to move around especially during summer. The park is huge with at least an hour to complete with photo taking. Consider to visit the two indoor domes offering; flower and waterfall theme.
These dome theme will change from time to time so your visit to the dome will always be fresh.
Extend your walk to Marina Bay Sand (MBS) with a connecting overhead bridge which oversee the view of the garden and the city lights from afar.",,
,,light show at night,5,,"i went late and didn't realize the supertrees were going to have a light show too. worth going, fun time.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay next to Marina Bay Sand's Hotel,5,,"These gadgets are not to be missed on any visit to Singapore.they are very well done, clean a d easy to navigate. By all means, be sure to visit at night between 7pm and midnight. The lights are well worth the visit in itself.",,
,,Amazing and Relaxing,5,,"Gardens by the bay is unique place. This living place is still growing, not in size but all the plant based objects. The bio-domes form a highlight and without revealing, something you have to experience since this is specular, not in adrenalin but in amazement and tranquility. Must see for anyone visiting Singapore, repeated visits recommended for anyone living of frequently visiting Singapore. (did not visit in Jan 2017, but this was the earliest option, visited a few years ago and plan to go there again to see how it is developing). The park is free, the bio-domes are not.",,
,,Un plaisir pour les yeux!,5,,"So amazed by the astonishing beauty of the plants, the infrastructure and the indoor waterfall. Better to visit at night and appreciate the show lights.",,
,,Wonderful experience with nature,5,,"It is a must visit attraction in Singapore, those who have love for nature for them it鈥檚 a must. Different type of flowers and plats at one place. It takes half a day to cover both flower dome and cloud forest.
Best time to visit is late afternoon 4 to 8 pm.",,
,,Social outing,4,,"It is good to go in the night when all the lights are on illuminating the tress , flowers to full effect which are appealing indeed to the eyes . More do , to go on the week end where activities and food galore prevail like street food held in conjunction of the and festival day like Xmas or Chinese New Year celebration . However you have to be prepared fir the snaking Q as locals and tourists love to throng the place just to enjoy the festival and ambience of the gardens .",,
,,A good place to enjoy and relax,5,,A lot of space to enjoy for young and young at hearts. This is a good place when you want to commune with nature but not living the city life.,,
,,"Neat, beautiful, joyful",5,,"This is where we go for our evening walks. South side is a huge garden of ponds, croaking frogs , lotuses , otters. Couples in love set up tents here, and profess their love. Great for an evening out with bikes and some food too. Keep walking till the barrage and you have Satay by the bay with many good stalls. Kids can get themselves wet in the musical fountains. Or maybe frolic in the treehouse. And all this is free! Pay for the flower domes, watch the indoor waterfall for a fee. Lovely half a day to be spent here.",,
,,Fantastic experience for whole family,5,,We attended during a Holland tulip display. This was great in and of itself but the rest of the gardens were equally interesting and beautiful.,,
,,Mr B .Perkins,5,,"A fantastic place to visit .So Much to see.Out of this world .there are two glass domes with a amazing variety of flowers& Plants , Huge trees ,Olive etc .Water falls.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,If you go to Singapore do not miss this. The winter wonderland is also great and the light show at night is good if your in the park. The cloud forest and flower dome are also highlights. It's a must.,,
,,1st Time Visit,4,,"the amount of money invested by SG government is ""crazy"" but worth it. For family who likes greenery but yet want to avoid direct sunshine this is the place to go. Friendly and easy accessible to all ages. Seniors and people with special needs can still be able to move around and see at least 80% of the exhibit indoor. Price wise, typical of all attraction around the world. It is worth to visit at least once.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"Loved Gardens by the Bay, the domes are a must do! Easy to get to via MRT. Light show was magnificent however due to weather they didn't operate the skywalk which was a bit disappointing but understandable. Also recommend checking out the Hawkers Centre 'Satay by the Bay' afterwards. Great eats!",,
,,tropical Gardens in the bay area,4,,"Fantastic ambience in Cloud Forest, especially on weekdays when the crowd thins out. Be sure to see the lights after 7 pm, wonderful misty atmosphere. Clean energy driving the sights in the garden.",,
,,Christmas at GBB,5,,"Feel the Christmas atmosphere-Enjoy Beautiful aurora boralis (northern lights) swaying around... lovely poinsettias, wonderful lighting. See the thin soldiers and feeling of white Christmas wz unique lavoo and the highlight - meeting Santa Claus in Santa's home.Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!",,
,,Beautiful place,5,,"This is one of my favourite places in one of my favourite cities. The Fresh air feels so good for your lungs! We also went on the skyway which is good too, and went into cloud forest which is a must! Its incredible!",,
,,A real WOW!,5,,"We visited the gardens twice during our stay in Singapore. Firstly we went to the two enormous greenhouse. Truly amazing. The first thing you notice is how much cooler it is inside. The first has a flower focus. The second has a fantastic central waterfall. We were too tired to visit the big trees so went back the next day. As we arrived there was a clap of thunder. As we got to the ticket box the attendant stuck a sign up saying the trees were closed due to ""inclement weather"". You can imagine our disappointment. Singapore has strict safety laws related to lightning. We had a cool drink and waited about 20 minutes before the trees were reopened. Check the weather for the day of your visit. The trees are terrific on our next visit to Singapore we will be visiting during the evening to see the lights.",,
,,Must See,5,,Gardens By The Bay is an amazing place to visit if you like plants and gardens. They have plants from all over the world.,,
,,Beautiful and must visit,4,,Lovely gardens and its must visit for garden lovers. Thr best is to go during evening if you want to enjoy lights however during the day the crowd is liess anf more convenient to walk around. Must go!,,
,,韦苇位蔚喂慰...wonderful,5,,I think that is the first priority for a visitor in Singapore to visit The Gardens By The Bay. Hundreds of thousands flowers from all over the world .... I can say one word: fabulous....,,
,,Sakura Matsuri,4,,Visited on a weekday so was not overly crowded. The Sakura flowers were in full bloomed and was really very beautiful. Many friendly staffs all around the flower dome and they helped us to take photographs.,,
,,Temperate garden in the tropics,4,,"As the captioned suggests, this is a man made temperate garden in tropical Singapore. Basically a huge air conditioned green house.
The wonder is in the size and the efforts made to get those temperate plants to flourish.

Will be especially interesting for first timer !",,
,,Great place,5,,"Amazing place and is a must see destination, taxis are cheap but use the hop on/off bus to get around.",,
,,Amazing Gardens,5,,"the gardens had species representing all locations on earth. It was educational and we got to see some species we had not seen in the locations we have visited in the past, but were from those areas.",,
,,Beautiful architecture,5,,"A must have seen for friends of modern gardens and plants of the region. In combination with the outside gardens, it is an amazing place.",,
,,Amazing place,5,,I loved visiting Gardens by the bay with my family. From the flowers Gardens area to the Cloud Forest and finally the Skyway light and music show. It was breath taking. Kudos to Singapore for such astonishing place,,
,,Beautiful Garden,5,,The garden is really beautiful. The entry to garden is free but if you want to visit Flower Dome or cloud forest than there is a ticket but its reasonably priced.,,
,,Wow- loved it,5,,Great day at Gardens by the bay - loved the domes went early in morning so not to busy great activity to do on a hot Singapore day as all air- conditioned. Amazingly well built and designed- kids had run around in water park outside which they enjoyed as well as park area with tree hutt which was fun! Thought Domes were reasonably priced.,,
,,Wow! Just beautiful !,5,,"This was the one place I wanted to visit on my trip. I wasn鈥檛 disappointed , it鈥檚 stunning. We went in the morning and it was our intention to visit again in the evening for the light show, I didn鈥檛 manage that and now I鈥檓 home I really wish I had! I鈥檒l just have to visit Singapore again. So my advice would be to visit mid afternoon and stay till you鈥檝e seen the light show (or do what I intended).

The gardens themselves are beautiful, the 鈥榯rees鈥?leave you in awe. Loved it all.",,
,,What to know to thoroughly enjoy this Gardens by the Bay,4,,"Gardens by the Bay is one of the must-gos if you're visiting Singapore. It's true that most of this attraction is man-made, but you have to be awed at the fact that the management had the chops to maintain such a gigantic Garden, bringing in all the magnificent breeds of plants, flora and fauna and housing them in one place for your viewing pleasure. Because this is simply no easy feat, considering the very different climates and conditions these plants come from, to be able to bring them over AND maintain them over a good period of time.

This attraction has numerous zones to enjoy:
- external area of the Garden is entirely free to public, and it's at least a 15-minute walk from the nearest MRT station at MBS (Marina Bay Sands). This 15-minute walk radius itself houses many beautiful plants, as well as a stroll along the ""river"" or bay (or else it won't be called Gardens BY THE BAY?). IF you find it hard to walk the entire way, you can obviously take a taxi and alight closer to where the two domes are. We also found out there is a paid shuttle service that picks visitors up from the MRT station exit. Apparently very enjoyable with a commentary during the ride.

- Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are definitely the two most famous botanical domes. Just Google photos to find out how great they look. You need to pay to enter either or both.

- Supertree Grove area is also free for the public to enter. Not many know this, but the 7.45pm or 8.45pm light and music show is truly awesome. Watch how the lights dance along to the playful rhythms, and all in the comfort of... their open green grass patch. Concerts and some exhibitions (e.g. Christmas light fun fair!) are held here too. So was the backdrop of the wedding party in Crazy Rich Asians. The only gripe I have was that the stretch of restaurants here were all closed for renovations when we visited a week after New Year! Busted my perfect plan of watching the show during dinner. Those restaurants should be reopened by now.

- OCBC Skywalk is that bridge at the Supertrees Grove area where you must walk to get the most awesome view of MBS, and of course of the Bay area itself. You need to pay for this. By the way, the cool IndoChine restaurant is also atop on of the Supertrees.

- Satays by the Bay is a great place to find local foods at a relatively good price, considering it's a touristy area. It's a little further from the two main domes so check out the map to know which way to head to.

- Water play area is another free to public area, and great for kids. It's almost right outside the flower dome area. Just remember to bring a towel and extra sets of clothes!",,
,,Excellent,5,,Had a great trip there was lots of information which needed time but the bus short trip was pretty informative,,
,,Definitely worth going,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is an impressive botanical garden that is unique to Singapore. In addition to the free outdoor areas there are the two domes which each have their own attributes. The flower done includes plants from around the world with a focus on seasonal varieties (cherry blossoms at the end of March). The cloud dome is an indoor rainforest with a focus on conservation and education. They are very different experiences, but both worthwhile. The super tree grove is a separate area that can be viewed without a ticket. A ticket is required to access the elevated walkway, which provides good views of the surrounding gardens.

There are multiple food options which include the Hawker style Satay by the Bay, a McDonalds and some higher end eateries.

A must stop on a visit to Singapore.",,
,,Excellent visitor experience,5,,"Thoroughly worth a visit when in Singapore, especially the Cloud Forest dome. Just watch out for large crowds at certain times.",,
,,"Sakura Festival, Cloud Forest, Supertrees Grove Light show",5,,"My family and I thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. As always, the beautiful baobabs and succulents collections were impressive as were the local flowers and orchids. Our visit this time though was a bit extra as they also had a Sakura festival going on at the time so we also got to enjoy the gorgeous japanese cherry blossoms and japanese garden set up.

My children particularly enjoyed the Cloud forest walk getting to go behind and around the man made falls.

Don鈥檛 miss the lights and music show at the Super trees grove. It is AMAZING!

Tips: would suggest arriving round 4pm for ample time to go round the flower dome and cloud forest. An hour- an hour and a half in each should give ample time to get a snack or dinner in between before the light show. It can get very cold at the flower dome. A jacket/ sweater would be very useful. Pretty much most of the attractions are wheelchair and stroller accessible. Toilets are clean and available. You can purchase tickets at the ticket counter or visit sites like Klook or Viator who also offer tour/ ticket bundles at savings.",,
,,Artificial experience,3,,"we visited here in Feb. we had heard a lot about this place but it was a bit disappointing. No doubt it was a beautiful place with lots of flowers and waterfall etc. but we felt everything is artificial. There were no insects in the Garden and every flower and plant looked manually painted.
People looking for natural beauty must not go there.",,
,,A fantastic nature park,4,,"This is a beautiful nature park that holds your breath. It's a futuristic park with both nature and technology providing a breath taking experience.
The super tree structures is most eye-catching.
The flower dome is a grand display of flowers while the Rain forest is a fabulous experience of tropical forests.
By the time you complete your trip of garden by the bay, you wonder at God 's creations.
Never miss this.",,
,,Must see 'bucket list' place to see.,5,,just simply outstanding place to visit but go late afternoon so you are there for the music and light show at 7.45 pm or 8.45 pm. simply stunning,,
,,excellent evening,5,,"if you visit Singapore you must visit Gardens by the Bay.
You will need to spend a few hours here there is so much to see and explore. The domes are amazing but so are the surrounding gardens , just pick a path and start walking.
Bring your camera and you wont be disappointed.",,
,,Must visit in Singapore,5,,"This is a must visit place in singapore. This site contain three theme, Supertree, Cloud Forst and flower Dome. Must visit each of them to enjoy the peace and quiet moment.",,
,,7 days in Singapore,4,,A must visit. Plenty to choose from. Light show on twice at night. Lifts and assistance available for those with mobility issues,,
,,A real highlight,5,,"Definitely worth visiting, amazing views and the plants are amazing to see. We took the walkway tour and this allows you to see some plants that are otherwise not in view",,
,,family friends cable,5,,"its nice garden for family time or friend gathering, or cable walk , I do enjoy it even with out having tektites for the forest and flower bay .",,
,,Well worth a visit,5,,"The best time of day to go here is about 4 so you can pay for entry ($28 no elderly convessions) to the large glass domes to see the plant displays, and see the waterfall and walk around the top of the glass downs on high level walkways. They stamp your hand if you would like to be able to return later in the day.
Then you can go and eat dinner the very nearby hawkers market and return at 7.45 to see the light and music show in the area of the supreme trees. The light display is free of charge.

Well worth a visit. You can also walk along to the barrage and look back in the city - amazing view especially at night.",,
,,Amazing green space,5,,This was the best part of Singapore for me. The gardens were amazing and nothing like I鈥檝e seen anywhere else! Free entry and only $8 for an adult on the skywalk through the trees. If you stay till 7:45 or 8:45 at night there is a 10min light and sound show. Be sure to get there a little early as spaces fill up and you鈥檒l end up on the ground. There are food carts there so best to make it a dinner show,,
,,"Fun, Inspiring, Hot 馃尀馃尀馃尀",5,,"Gardens by the Bay is a huge meticulously planned attraction that is bound to entertain families with children of all ages. The domes are their best attraction, and it's highly recommended especially for those adverse to extreme heat. There are children's wet and dry play areas with well appointed cleaning locker areas. The Supertrees are best seen at night but be prepared for long queues if you want to climb up and walk it bridges. Lots of eating and biking spaces around the park. Highly recommend to bring scooters or bikes for the little ones if you plan to walk around the park. Great food in Satay by the Bay. Bring a water bottle.",,
,,Beautiful Natural Gardens,5,,"Quite impressed with this site, the flower gardens and the cloud gardens. Very well organized, easy to navigate and well worth the visit.",,
,,"Very nice but a bit packed during the weekend, but an online ticket",5,,It is a great way to relax yourself in a nice cool place. I have bought the ticket online and I think it was a great idea as the line was quite long. Reserve approx. 2-3 hours.,,
,,Short stopover,5,,"Fantastic, especially at night when the light show is taking place. Well worth a visit, will return ASAP hopefully.",,
,,Spent all day here,5,,"Fabulous gardens with plenty to see, especially the Supertrees.
Entry to the gardens is free but there is a charge to walk on the elevates Skyway and the two domes. These domes are definitely worth a visit, not only for their lovely displays but also to cool down from the daytime heat!
We had a drink up the largest Supertree, and this also gave us access to the top floor viewing platform which was really worth it.

Finally the evening music and light show was excellent and again was free to all. The MRT was busy at the end of the show, however the crowds disappeared quite quickly.",,
,,Great place,5,,Had lots of fun for a few hours here. Go early and beat the que. Bring g a sweater as it can get cold,,
,,Unbelievable,5,,We went back for the night exhibition and was not disappointed. Give yourself a full day if you鈥檙e into gardens. Go early and see the outside areas to avoid the heat. Was looking forward to seeing this for years and wasn鈥檛 disappointed. Good value for money make sure you get a stamp to get back in at night.,,
,,Worth a visit if you are in Singapore,5,,"We鈥檇 seen short films on this place and we found it to be as interesting as it looked in the films. The Cloudforest is more authentic than the Flower Garden which feels like a bunch of different vegetations thrown together in a small, crowded area.",,
,,A fantastic expirence .,5,,These two domes are situated on reclaimed land and surrounded by very large public ( Free ) gardens. Access can be via the Hop on and Off buses or via special lifts on the forth floor of the Sands Casino. Having been to similar domes in Cornwall England it was good to compare and I would say both sites are equally good. Plenty of other attractions ( some chargeable ) are situated within the gardens and it is quite easy to pass a day at the location.,,
,,Favourite place in Singapore - simply stunning,5,,"We had a 24 hour stopover in Singapore each way on our journey and it was our first time to Singapore. Despite having such limited time we went here twice. First in the day and second by night. It鈥檚 stunning. The perfect place to wonder round and look up at the city and looks completely different both times

We hopped in a can both times (very cost effective) and easy to get to.",,
,,"Wonderful experience, its good with the visible signs in the dark",5,,"There is a light show between 1930-2000 which is worth watching. There are lots of people so you better be early.
As a person with night blindness traveling solo, it was a bit challenging but manageable to get around in the dark, there were these wonderful shining signs that made it possible for me tea leave the lase without breaking a bone or stepping on someone麓s unattended children.",,
,,A show not to be missed...,5,,I have visited this place with group of friends. We were at the top of marina bay sands and planned 45 minutes to get in time for the audio/light show under the super trees. Probably 1 hr would give you enough time to leisurely do it.or if you want to get on the skywalk...but we made it just in time for 1945 show. It is one of those things you simply have to do in Singapore.. it was busy but we found the spot to sit under the trees.. it was a spectacular 15 min show and i thoroughly enjoyed it,,
,,Wonderful place. Take your time,5,,We went all day to the gardens at the bay. Take a ticket including the visit of the flower dome and cloud dome.Discover plants and flowers from all over the world. A special Japanese festival with sakura took place this month. We joind a guided tour for this but explanation was very poor quality. Wonderful place an a must in Singapore,,
,,Its A gardern Like no Other,5,,"Just a very few walk from the Marina Bay Mall and Iconic Merlion this garden is one of a kind, you could see vast variety of plants, which are really beautiful",,
,,Surreal at night,5,,We visited late at night. The lightning of the sights is fantastic. The noise of the frogs in the various ponds deafening. The central trees like surreal props from the film Avatar. A superb place to visit. The floating baby...scarey,,
,,Tourists trap,2,,"Ok so you got to see the Super trees in Gardens by the bay. Everyone visiting Singapore do. Entry to the gardens is free but everything els that you can do here is crazy expensive. Walking the skyway must be the biggest rip-off in Singapore.

Instead head over to the Botanic Garden (also free if you avoid the orchid garden) or maybe the Chinese and Japanese garden (also free) and take in the atmosphere here. Ten times better than this tourist trap.",,
,,Beautiful,4,,Beautiful but is literally just plants. Good walk around and look. Great photo opps. Air conditions to help cool down.,,
,,In March,2,,"Very disappointing. Not much to see and confusing about what is available to see. Heard afterwards there is a good laser light show at certain times in the evenings, but did not see this advertised. All the restaurants are very touristy and overpriced for tourists.",,
,,Out of this world,5,,"Went to have a look at the Gardens by the Bay for the first time at night on our brief Singapore visit and we were completely astonished, amazed and fascinated by the spectacular light show at night. It was like seeing something from another world. We also came back and visited it during the day .It is certainly a beautiful garden by day; a place where you can walk and enjoy the pleasant and tranquil gardens or just sit under a tree and watch the world go by. Highly enjoyed",,
,,ICK. Global Warming PROPAGANDA MONSTER.,1,,"Frighteningly distasteful display of full-blown political misinfmation. I told my family to 鈥渓ook away鈥?lest they be turned to stone. Please. Let us enjoy the biological diversity without the brainwashing. Thank you, very much!",,
,,Beautiful way to escape the heat,4,,The domes are gorgeous. We slowly made our way through the domes during the day and then experienced the magic of Super tree grove at night. A relaxing day in the flora!,,
,,Amazing night show,5,,"There are two domes, cloud and flower dome, required entrance free, but the garden is free entry including the night show. It鈥檚 better to reach there before sun set, walk along the skyway (S$8.00), and watch the night show at 7:45. There鈥檚 a second at 8:45 as well. The show was amazing and worth to wait.",,
,,Not to be missed,5,,This was good value for the admission fee. We spent a full morning meandering. Both domes were beautiful. The orchids were especially beautiful,,
,,Go to the bar at the top of the super tree.,4,,"We saw the gardens at night, which meant many of the features were shut down, but it also very quiet, which was nice, the darkness also allowed the supertrees to really pop. There is a bar at the top of one supertree; there is a cover which includes one drink, but is worth it for the view. The bar is self is not much to write about, but sipping a cocktail with the evening view was very pleasant.",,
,,Great day out,5,,"Easily accessible by metro from hotel, we loved the whole experience, reasonable as well we thought price wise.",,
,,Lovely Place to hangout,4,,Unless you're a massive nature nerd I wouldnt bother paying the extra for the cloud forest and flower dome but it is a lovely place to hangout especially early evening into the night as you will get to see the lanterns all lit up as well as the gold wishing tree and it is cooler !,,
,,A nice day with the kids,5,,"We arrived there at 10 though if possible I would like to come at opening hour (9 am), Went to the flower and cloud dome, the children so-so liked it because it was beautiful and cool. But that was only that for them. Ate at Bakerzin there. I would like to taste Pollen but I think Bakerzin is more suitable for my kids taste. Well I was wrong, Even though it tasted really nice in my opinion, they didn't like it much. Then at 13.30 we went to Children Garden, we dpn't bring swimsuit so they played with underwear and tshirt (they were 2 and 4 yo so I think it is appropriate), changed clothes there in their kids shower (closed area) using only small towel (the one to wipe face) to dry them. Suffice due to hot weather. I think this children garden is the highlight of the garden for my children. Used the taxi to go to Artscience museum. 10 SGD... but we were tired due to the heat. Overall I think the garden is a must but just prepare your heart if your children don't like it that much.",,
,,Visit Night & Day!,5,,"We visited the Gardens of the Bay twice during our stay in Singapore. The first time we visited was to see the night lights display which started at 20:45 and lasted for 15 minutes. This was free to enter and was amazing to experience.

The second time we visited was during the day and we walked around the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest (鈧?8 for entry to both) before paying 鈧? (ticket bought separately) to go on the walkway. I would recommend to do all three of these as we enjoyed our time in all.

Lots of flowers to view in the Flower Dome (the theme was Japanese Spring during our time of visit), there was also an impressive waterfall to view in the Cloud Forest and the walkway was good fun. Lots of great photo opportunities throughout the day although the two domes did get very crowded (we visited on a Saturday). I would also not recommend the cafe (next to McDonald鈥檚), overpriced and not the best food!",,
,,Artificial but Stunning,5,,"Great architecture and planning. An enjoyable walk for tourists from various age groups within the air-conditioned premises. Basically a man-made tropical rainforest minus the heat, minus the leeches and mosquitoes, plus the ease of walk-ability.",,
,,Birthday gift,5,,"I bought the tickets as a birthday gift for my sister who had newly arrived in Singapore for a three year secondment. She messaged me to say that the visit experience was ""the best birthday ever"" 馃憤馃槉",,
,,"Great architecture A bit Clinically, no real nature. gardens",2,,"Great architecture A bit Clinically, no real nature. gardens, no animals. Artificial trees instead of Rainforests.",,
,,gardens by the bay,5,,"What we saw was beyond our expectations. Words cannot express fully. Magnificent dome, gardens, massive structures with sky walk, evening exclusive lighting made this place a dream land.",,
,,Must visit!,5,,"Yes, the upfront entry$ might seem a bit much, but it is well worth every penny and you will understand why once you see the upkeep requirements and displays. Super clean and maintained. The eco/bio-spheres/dome[s] and gardens are fantastic even for those who can't raise a house plant! Guaranteed to please, even children with the waterfalls and walkways and displays or sculptures. Easy/recommended to get there by the MRT. A great walk even in the heat and once inside the domes, you are instantly cooled and entranced with the experience. Plan on 3 hours minimum to visit.",,
,,Highlight,5,,Spent longer here than we expected. Both the indoor gardens and the outdoor supertrees are stunning.,,
,,Must visit place in singapore,5,,A remarkable and beautiful structure built. Needs atleast half day to completely enjoy the place. dont forget to look out for the super tree lighting show in the evening. be there atleast half an hour early for the best spot.,,
,,Go for the light show,5,,"Make sure you see the light show. It鈥檚 at 7:45 and 8:45 daily (I believe ) , lie down underneath the trees and have a look and relax. I only visited at night and it was worth it",,
,,Amazing,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is a nature park spanning 101 hectares reclaimed land in the Central Region of Singapore, adjacent to the Marina Reservoir. The park consists of three waterfront gardens: Bay South Garden (in Marina South), Bay East Garden (in Marina East) and Bay Central Garden.
Gardens by the Bay is part of the nation's plans to transform its Garden City to a City in a Garden , with the aim of raising the quality of life by enhancing greenery and flora in the city. It one of the popular tourist attractions in Singapore, the park received more than 15 million visitors every year.

We went to this park at 6 PM by the bridge from our hotel Marina Bay sand to the Garden.It around 300 meter to the gate . There are many thind to see like Supertree Grove,Flower Dome to enjoy in beautiful garden and finally the show.It worth visit and every penny to seethe amazing flowers.",,
,,Sakura Adoration at Gardens by the Bay,5,,"The last time we visited (as a family) was about two years ago when GbtB had Lilytopia (a season for lilies). We were mesmerised by both the conservatories - Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. On this recent trip, it was the sakura (cherry blossoms) theme that drew the family over. I am immensely impressed with the wide range of sakura species that the Gardens brought in for tourists and locals to enjoy. The arrangement of the sakura trees around the Dome was well thought-out. Park rangers were available to assist with photo takings and to guide visitors. Do spend time to enjoy the permanent gardens within the Dome, e.g. Californian garden, South African and South American gardens, Baobabs, Mediterranean garden and Succulent plant garden. This trip, I got to know more about Baobabs (special African trees). Allow half a day",,
,,Beautiful escape on a warm day,5,,"This was the first time I had visited the domes with guests, despite being in Singapore for several years! They are a wonderful escape from particularly warm days as they are both temperate. The cloud dome is particularly spectacular having a waterfall from roof to floor, which you progress to the summit during your cleverly managed 'roam'! The flower dome was a little lack lustre on our visit as the Sakura exhibit was nearing its conclusion and the next flower exhibit not yet in place.",,
,,Really worth a visit,5,,"My wife and I recently visited the gardens by the bay, it really is worth a visit with the two large glass domes and huge waterfall inside,the amount of plants to see is a great way to spend a few hours.",,
,,Unique Experience!,5,,"My sister and I visited the Gardens by the Bay and we enjoyed it very much. The show was spectacular and the lights were beautiful. If you find yourself hungry, there are places you can get a small snack.

I wish it stayed open later.

It is easy to get a taxi to and from there as it is a very popular destination. I would recommend downloading one of the taxi apps so you become a priority.",,
,,Never seen such a garden before,5,,Excellent collection and nice flowers to captures moments. You can enjoy a variety of flowers in this garden,,
,,Reach by afternoon and spent a night,5,,"This is an amazing place you can spent an eve with your loved ones. Reach by afternoon so you can watch the flower dome and garden. There is cloud walk in evening after 7, and free light show in the garden. Do not miss both. There is only 2 shows, get the exact time once you reach there and plan. This will take you to another world.",,
,,Amazing,5,,"So worth the time to visit here, just stunning even if like me you are not a passionate gardener. The cloud and flower dimes are a must, truly an experience.",,
,,Do Not Miss,5,,"This truly unique gardens on the bay was so worth the miles of walking around the site. So were the budding cherry blossom鈥檚. The dual domes, sky walks, waterfall and regional examples of foliage were great to explore! There were hoards of tourists marvellilng at this spectacular feat of engineering.",,
,,"just focus on the ""Trees""",3,,"The Shuttle is needed when you are complete out of Energy. Otherwise it works without and for free. The Rain Forrest and the Botanic House is realy not a very special point to visit. Just for for Flip Flop Forrest and Garden Visitors. But the ""Trees"" and the Canopy is worth the Money!!",,
,,Nice relaxing day,5,,"Very good way to escape the heat of the day as the domes are temperature controlled, can even be a little cold in places.
Kids and adults will all find points of interest throughout both domes and will pass a few hours quite easily.
Quite a few food options right at the dome, or a short walk along the waterfront to some street type food.
Excellent way to spend a day, and a must if you have a couple of days in Singapore.",,
,,Nice,4,,Best thing about the gardens are the impressive trees. Amazing night light show. Beautiful surroundings. Flower dome and cloud dome are nice.....but not a must in my opinion.,,
,,Amazing Gardens and Light Display,5,,"We stayed two nights at the Marina Bay Sands and had a view these amazing gardens and the nightly light show. We were only able to spend a couple of hours one afternoon in the gardens, but I can't recommend it enough. Really magical with the towers. I would like to return and watch the light show from garden ground level.",,
,,Don't miss!,5,,"This is a beautiful setting-- the Flower Dome and the Cloud dome are amazing and so well done. We were there in the afternoon on a Sunday, and it was quite crowded, so navigating the crowds to see everything was a trick, but well worth it. The light show began at 7:45 and went on for 15 minutes-- absolutely beautiful! Get there EARLY to get a spot to sit for the best view.",,
,,Impressive scenery,4,,"Very nice big area, and the two domes were super and beautiful. We also enjoyed the water par facilities even though the rain made an impact and the activities were closed down midway of the session. All vehicles were also cancelled which made is my very difficult for a family with two younger kids and a toddler in a stroller to make way to the MRT.",,
,,Garden Splendour of Singapore,5,,"Gardens By the Bay is a must see for any tourist who comes to Singapore.
There is a version that caters to every kind of tourist.

For elders there are golf carts that tour around the luscious gardens.

For young children lots of place to run around, water play and during school holidays, there is always some kind of special activity going on.
. For lovers there are cosy nooks within the park, and the lively and lovely air conditioning inside Cloud forest and Flower Dome.

The food lovers will enjoy the water side walk to Satay by the Bay.

The eco enthusiasts willll love to know that the entire property runs on bio fuel.

For those tourists who have limited money to spend, the light shows in the evenings are spectacular and the photo opportunities with Marina Bay Sands in the backdrop is breathtaking.

This is a very instagrammable place as well, which also hosta some fine dining restaurants.

Overall, irrespective of age group, this is a crowd pleasing attraction - young and old alike.",,
,,Flowers touched and accidentally broke them by some visitors.,3,,I would like to suggest to have a signboard at entrance to mention not to touch plant or flower so other visitors get to enjoy too.,,
,,Fabulous!,5,,"I can only concur with other reviews; the Gardens by the Bay are fabulous and, quite literally, awesome.
We arrived at the Bayfront MRT and within a few short paces arrived at the first reception area. Of a certain age and not wishing to walk too far we opted to pay for an audio-guided golf cart ride around the park. This cost $11/person and was very well worth it, including shuttles to and from the main domed area. The audio-guided tour was excellent and enabled us to see the entire area and to understand the significance of what we were seeing. We chose not to do the aerial walkway between the 鈥渟upertrees鈥? Access to both domes was $28 and, again, very worthwhile. The flowers and trees are amazing and the engineering of the domes quite breathtaking.
The Gardens really are a 鈥渕ust-do鈥? Quite fabulous. We visited during the day; the evening light shows must be amazing.",,
,,Unique Vertical Gardens,4,,"I recently visited the Gardens ByThe Bay at Singapore. Its a unique nature park spanning 101 hectares of reclaimed land. Super Trees which are giant structures are beautifully to see in the eve due to a colorful laser show. These also offer an impressive skywalk over the gardens which give you a feel of the rainforest. There are hundreds of trees and plants to discover within, making Gardens by the Bay a great destination for both kids and grownups. Cloud Forest is another feather here which has infinity types of plants decorated very well. Not to forget, one must visit the Flower Dome where you have a wide range of flowers displayed which are mostly from many parts of the world. Very colorful, beautiful and some unusual shaped flowers. Do visit the Gardens By The Bay as it is worth especially for NATURE LOVERS.",,
,,A Must Do in Singapore,5,,"This is our second trip to Singapore. The first time we went through the park but didn't take in the flower dome and cloud forest as we didn't have time. We made sure we experienced them this time around.

The Japanese Cherry Blossom exhibit was here and it was definitely worthwhile to see it. The exhibit is amazing!

We went on a weekday so it wasn't too busy. It certainly is a nice repreave from the heat to be able to spend a few hours inside the wonderfully aircooled gardens.

The cloud forest was amazing as well. It is nicely laid out in that you take the elevator to the top and then work your way down through the different areas.

Lunch at Satay by the Bay was a huge hit afterwards. Really good food at reasonable prices.",,
,,Spectacular day and night,5,,"Used our tourist pass to travel there. Very quick and simple. We purchased a $28 pass, which you use for both the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. We also bought a $3pp ( unlimited trips) shuttle ticket. The walk is reasonable, but on a hot day you are better off saving your walking for the exhibits.",,
,,The most gorgeous gardens in the world?!,5,,"Gardens by the bay are probably the BEST tourist attraction in Singapore. I鈥檓 not saying that, all my friends from overseas say that. As a local, I have visited GBTB at least 10 times already. The best part is that even if you don鈥檛 want to spend $23 to go to the 2 airconditioned conservatories (WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD YOU MISS FLOWER DOME AND CLOUD FOREST?!), you can still enjoy the children鈥檚 water park, beautiful gardens, Lakes with sculptures and amazing photo opps, walking, jogging and cycling paths next to the meandering river, all while taking in amazing views of the Singapore flyer and marina bay sands and watch the most amazing lights and music show at supertree grove...absolutely FREE! This is the really the most amazing attraction ever! And don鈥檛 forget to the top off the visit by having some amazing local meals at satay by the bay food-court! Of course you could also stick to McDonalds or eat at Michelin star restaurants, 50 feet above ground atop a SuperTree!

MUST VISIT!",,
,,THE must see in Singapore,5,,"Unbelievable gardens where you should spend your time even if just passing through Singapore. Don鈥檛 leave without seeing the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome, which charge for tickets. Worth every penny. Felt like I was in another world, like Avatar鈥檚 Pandora, surrounded by plants I鈥檝e never seen before. Absolutely marvelous. Be mindful that the air conditioning is cranked high and could be chilly inside the domes.",,
,,Stunning Gardens,4,,I enjoyed touring the domes and seeing the living trees. The light show is amazing and walking up among the treetops was awesome. A trip to Singapore should include Gardens By The Bay. The real message is the sustainability the trees represent.,,
,,Will leave you breathless at the natural beauty and get you out of the heat too!,5,,"I can see why this is rated one of the top botanical gardens in the world. The architecture is stunning but is overshadowed by the natural beauty inside the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome. They are amazing and we also had the good fortune to be there at Cherry Blossom time when they were featuring a number of special Japan-inspired exhibits and lots of beautiful blooming flowering trees. The only negative is that there are way too many people inside. It can be very difficult to get a photo without someone else's family right in the middle of it. Would be great if they would limit the numbers of folks who could be in there at any one time, but I know this is only in my dreams. The $3 unlimited shuttle pass is worth every penny. The walks might not seem very far but when it is 96 degrees out...",,
,,Probably the number one attraction in Singapore,5,,"If you are going to Singapore then a visit to the Gardens by tge bay is absolutely essential. Beautiful by day but stunning by night, don鈥檛 miss the fantastic light show at dusk",,
,,Beautiful place,5,,"Very beautiful place to see. Belongs absolutely places to see! Inside the domes there are wide selection of plants and presentations of plants from all over the world. There are also some ""hidden"" fairy tale figures among the plants.",,
,,Lovely place to visit,5,,Very unusual architectural place to visit. High viewing bridge was interesting and light show every evening at dusk.,,
,,This place is so nature,5,,You can find a great place to breath in town here. It is good to be here all day. At 7.45 pm there is a tree light show which I missed it. There are Sakura trees during this season which is so beautiful. I recommend you to buy ticket at travel agency. It is a bit cheaper but you don't have to wait for the queue at the counter.,,
,,Great visit,5,,"Well worth a visit the gardens are really worth seeing but very busy with many Asian photographers posing everywhere.
The plants and layout justifies the hype and if from the UK and you like your gardens and plants this is a must visit combine in the late afternoon evening with the light show.",,
,,Beautiful,4,,"Beautiful place, busy but easy to get around. Stunning views, spotlessly clean and free to view. A must when in Singapore.",,
,,Beautiful but busy,5,,"Visited on a Sunday and it was very busy. The flower dome had a cherry blossom festival on but you could hardly walk around the dome it was that busy.
The cloud forest was quieter and fabulous to see. Loved the waterfall and all of the tropical plants. One of our favourite things to do",,
,,Gardens at the Bay. Singapore,5,,A little unorganised for a tour by buggy which is not well signpostes once you get your voucher. Its worth doing if you are short of time and not great in the humidity. You can pay extra to get up the Skywalk which gives you great views and 15 minutes to walk around up there. Accessed by a lift.,,
,,Not bad if you like interesting collection of plants.,3,,I think gardeners will appreciate the Singapore Botanical gardens more. This is a well thought out structure but not all about plants. More about getting people in moving them around and out. Too busy to enjoy.,,
,,Excellent Exhibition and Interior Design of Natures,5,,"Spectacular interior of the flower dome and the cloud forest. Definitely worth the ticket price if you're a nature person and likes to see plants, trees and flowers and little bit of nature at its habitat.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"We spent a few hours here going through the cloud forest and flower dome. Both are exceptional. While we were there they had a special Japanese garden display with cherry blossom trees, Japanese food and you could even hire Kimonos to walk around in. The High platform walk in the cloud forest gives an amazing view over the gardens and even my height challenged husband had no trouble going around on it.",,
,,Amazing,5,,So so beautiful and well worth a visit! Easily accessed via public transport. Free to visit but some sections there is an admission cost which is quite expensive,,
,,Must see,5,,"Incredible and In learnt a lot that day. This is a must see sight. Very educational, great for kids.",,
,,2019 Garden by the bay Sakura festival,4,,"Display is organized however, trail is one-way which means it will lead to the exit and u have to re-enter to view",,
,,Sakura Matsuri,5,,"It was a lovely day I've ever spent time with my friends,seeing Sakura blooming all over there but unfortunatelly is not as pretty as 2 years back.",,
,,Waterfall is the highlight. everything else BORING !!!,1,,"don't go unless you are over 70 years of age. waterfall was the highlight. everything else didn't make sence, fake this and fake that....educational rooms. huh?",,
,,Wow and wow again!,5,,I鈥檓 not classically a 鈥済arden type of guy.鈥?But this is amazing. Flowers side was a little crowded. But gorgeous all the same. The forest side was truly breathtaking and amazing... I actually could feel my heart rate slow and the relaxation sink in. The enormity of the undertaking to construct and maintain this wonder is ominous and humbling. Just go.,,
,,Garden by the bay,5,,Beautiful garden with amazing flowers and views. Refreshing to step into this exhibit and enjoy so many beautiful creations,,
,,beautiful garden,5,,"it is an excellent garden with 2 air conditioned dome with lots of flowers, amazing view surrounding the garden , highly recommend to visit for tourist attraction",,
,,Must see both day & night- this is a full day out.,5,,"This is really an experience for all ages, whether you like nature or not. We had several visits here, the first at night for the super trees light show, was also other shows going on under the super trees due to CNY celebrations, so lots to look at. The light show is spectacular, try to find your way up to the area near the 鈥榮ecret life of trees鈥?where there is a walking track that goes around this raised area, and lots of sitting areas to be closer to the super trees. Take the time to stroll around the Dragonfly lake by night as is truely remarkable & so different to the day time. We then went back a few days later to see the rest of the gardens, including the two domes - awesome, fun for all. We were able to get discounted tickets through Klook. This is a full days outing if you want to soak up all that is on offer. Definitely visit the hawker centre at Satay by the Bay - yum. Check the website for any closure times of the domes for maintenance as we had to change our plans due to these closures. Don鈥檛 forget to do the skywalk, good for conquering those fear of height issues.",,
,,Beautiful gardens to be explored,5,,These gardens were beautiful and the tree structures were very impressive including the walkway between them. These gardens can be explored day and night for different experiences. There is a daily light show at night between 8.45 and 9.45 pm. There are two domes exhibiting two indoor gardens including extensive outdoor gardens. Much if the external gardens can be explored without cost . There is a cost to entering to two domes. Well worth a visit by day and night to experience it in different ways.,,
,,Lovely place to view,5,,"One of the places you have to see if you are in Singapore. It is just great to walk around, see the beautiful design and trees. It is supposed to be amazing at night with beautiful nights, however we did not get to do that due to the kids being tired.",,
,,Excellent experience.,5,,"Stunning grounds and environment, well organised and thoughtfully planned out sites. Can recommend this area of Singapore for a visit to anyone and age group.",,
,,A must for any visit to Singapore,5,,"We first visited Gardens By The Bay one evening to see the light show. Despite being very busy, there was just enough space for everyone and exciting to see the Supertrees during the evening light show. The following day we revisited to see the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome and had a much calmer and more peaceful experience. Upon entering the Cloud Forest, the indoor waterfall is amazing and what a sight to first be greeted with! It is fabulous to slowly wind your way down the walkways, with an amazing variety of foliage to admire, plus some great views of the city and harbour. The Flower Dome is also beautiful and really interesting to explore the different plants from around the world. Thoroughly enjoyable and highly recommended for any visit to Singapore.",,
,,Pretty,4,,"Took a nice walk to this beautiful place. The colours are so pretty! Would highly recommend to see this place, but go early morning. There are some fees to pay depends on wich part you want to go. Prices vary between places. The only down side, if you are coming from the side of the famous hotel it can be tricky to find your way to the Gardens By The Bay. There鈥檚 no access from The mall note from the hotel unless you are acutely staying in the hotel I believe. It鈥檚 a really nice place to take photos !",,
,,Absolutely wonderful,5,,"This is probably one of the most spectacular attractions in SIngapore. We spent the best part of an afternoon looking through all the displays, and even better is the fact that the domes are air conditioned, allowing a reprieve from Sinagpore's humidity.",,
,,A must visit place in Singapore.,5,,Great place for family and kids. The place is huge so it requires quite some time to see everything properly. I totally recommend it.,,
,,"Always hot, but such a joyful place!",5,,"We had been before, but still loved the experience...and this time we travelled in an autonomous vehicle! Excellent!",,
,,Sakura Matsuri march 2019,5,,This is such a beautiful sight at the flower dome. Here is where I learned the many species of Sakura flowers.. Different breeds & shades of whites & pinks. It coincides with my Half run for that weekend. I'll be back this weekend as there will be cosplay & sakura market place going on at the same location. Something not to be missed,,
,,Curios,5,,"Good, nice, fine, sweet, excellent, great place for walking, visiting, meeting and more. Find a time to visit",,
,,Proud to have GBB,5,,"Its good to see more green in Singapore, and best they always bring in different theme of flowers that we might need to fly to the country for the special season.
Maybe should have free ride to shutter the whole garden. Flower Dome and rain forest was the best... beautiful place.",,
,,#NatureAwareness,5,,I was amazed at how the Singaporean love nature. We have a lot of flowers and grass which can be found in the Philippines but never been valued and cultivated. Our travel reminds me that we are rich in natural resources and we have to value it even though we are not as-as rich as Singapore.,,
,,I visited this stunning attraction on March 20th this year just on dusk.,5,,"I bought before I left Australia and through my travel agent the Singapore Airlines advertised Explorer Pass This pass gave me unlimited journeys on the Hop On Hop Off buses, entry to the National Museum, Night Safari, Singapore Aquarium and the Gardens by the Bay which for me was the standout attraction especially seeing the Cherry Blossom trees in full flower. I visited around 5.30 pm and saw the gardens all lit up. A very special experience for me as a solo traveller..",,
,,Overall Ok,4,,Only disappointment was the japanese fair for the sakura fest last only two weeks as when i went there it was already over. The fair should have last longer together with the same duration of sakura fest.,,
,,Lived up to our expectations,5,,Only had a day on our cruise in Singapore and Gardens was on our list. Booked online before cruise. Arrived there after lunch and went straight into the Flower Dome then the Cloud Forest. It was lovely and cool in there and the colours and arrangements were brilliant. Then it was a quick walk by the Supertrees then unfortunately onto a 97 bus to the cruise port. Need at least 3 days to see Singapore properly. Would definitely visit again.,,
,,Care for Environment,4,,crowd Management need to improve and AC Temp in Dome was too low... very detailed and return for Money paid,,
,,Wonderful experience,5,,"My wife and I went to the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest on our 25th Wedding Anniversary - we saw the sakuras and took lots of photos - it was very memorable, spending 4 hours and thoroughly enjoying our trip",,
,,Amazing!,5,,This is our 2nd time visiting both cloud forest & flower dome and it doesn鈥檛 fail to impress my fianc茅 and I yet again We visited this time around due to the Sakura Blossoms event and some sculptures made us feel like we were in Japan Overall an enjoyable experience!,,
,,Bad customer service from call CSO,3,,Had call up the CSO to inquire regarding the price difference between the dome tickets and the flora attraction which I鈥檓 unaware off. He sounds impatient and blaming me for not reading carefully on the website which mentioned the new flora attraction opens in April which I thought the Sakura is holding at that place. Forgotten to ask him for his name.,,
,,Excellent time,5,,"Flower Dome was beautiful, especially with the Sakura Trees. You may want to bring a thin sweater. It can get bit cold when you stay longer inside.",,
,,Awesome place,5,,"Awesome place to hangout with your loved ones!

For people with Budget yet wanna enjoy with your loved ones:
Outdoor is free with nice views, have a romantic OCBC skywalk at just $5
McDonald鈥檚 nearby

For people with no Budget:
Visit the domes with seasonal display of flowers (eg, Sakura for March-April)
Good restaurants to fill your stomachs",,
,,A must one time visit,4,,"This is a big place situated in the back side of Marina bay Sands. There are 4 main attractions:
1. Flower Dome : This is very huge superbly air conditioned greenhouse. You will get to see a lot flowers and plants in flower dome . If you have interest in Botany you can read out the description on plants. or If you are interested in photography you have good chance here to capture colorful flower setup. If you are into plants, visit might take up to 2-3 hours but if you are not interested (like me), you can wrap up the place in 30 mins.

2. Cloud Forest : It is also a huge superbly air conditioned greenhouse but with a big waterfall inside and walkway bridge from 7th floor. It also has science museum. Once you enter this place, you will be greeted by a huge artificial waterfall. Then you have to take elevator to go the top floor from where you can walk in the bridge toward the downstairs.

3. OCBC SkyWay : This is a glass bridge connecting the super grove tress. You can take 15-30 minutes walk on this . You can get good view of overall garden and Singapore city from here. But preferred time is 7:30-7:45pm when there will be light show.

4. Light Show: There is free and awesome light show that you can enjoy at night 7.45pm and 8.45pm. Go to Sky way to enjoy this show more.

This place is huge so expect lot of walking. In addition to this, there is no good restaurants out here and one that is here is super expensive. So it will be wise to bring some snacks with us to eat while we roam. As greenhouses are superbly air conditioned, you might want to carry light jacket. Overall this place needs 4-5 hours to roam completely and after you finish you can also walk towards marina bay sands.",,
,,Terrific,5,,A must do when visiting Singapore. You could spend a very long time looking around. While in the conservatories it was very comfortable. An escape from the heat and humidity outside.,,
,,Prepay to visit the domes,5,,"These gardens are very impressive and so expansive, I don't know if you could see it all in one day!
It is worth the price to get into the flower dome and cloud forest. I would recommend prepurchasing tickets to avoid a needless queue. We went on a Saturday and we had to wait for about 15minutes, so it wasn't too bad.
The light and sound show was spectacular, but arrive 1-hour early to claim your spot - choose somewhere with a good view of a large and smaller tree. Bring a blanket or a cushion, lay back and enjoy!",,
,,Iconic and beautiful,4,,The Gardens by the bay are a must do when in SIngapore. Buy your tickets online with your hotel app or tourist app to safe time and money. The cloud and dome were beautiful and well laid out. The skywalk is an extra $8 and we thought this was probably a waste of money for the 100m stretch of walkway. The rest of the gardens are huge and you could literally spend hours walking around this part and they are free! The night light show gives a different perspective to the gardens but can be viewed from outside or across the river even.,,
,,Go at night for Rhapsody,5,,An experience not to be missed in Singapore. Pro tip: I recommend going at night for the light show. It's just a more magical experience at night regardless.,,
,,One of Singapore鈥檚 best places to Visit,5,,"If you are visiting Singapore and wandering where to visit then visit the Gardens By The Bay.
There are a few different ways you can access the gardens, we accessed them from the Marina Bay Sands Resort.
There is no charge to visit the gardens itself, but there is a charge for entering the Flower Dome & the Cloud Forest S$28 per person which we thought was money well spent. It鈥檚 also S$8 each to access the tree walk.
There are restaurants and toilet facilities in the gardens.
Well worth a visit even just to see the gardens for free as they are amazing.",,
,,The gift that keeps on giving,5,,"When you get to a certain age, it becomes harder backpacking trough Europa( next August ) or sleeping in a swag ( last month ), so the mind wonders towards not flying in the cheapest seats and now taking taxis instead of walking to save money.
So now you start to realise that there are only a few cities in the world worth visiting 3 or 4 times, and one of those is Singapore and their magnificent gardens by the sea, it is like entering heaven, fantastic,trees,shrubs from all over the world, flowers and luckyl this time the cherry blossoms where out in great force, the one thing I love is the great variety of flowers like we have in our gardens at home, but looking so much healthier.
The grevilles where not out this time but the kangaroo paws looked out of this world.
Love the attendants and most of the other visoters where also smiling,great.
The only thing I did not do this time was the skywalks at the higher levels( must be getting old at75), but the rest was easy to access and it was also easy for people in wheelchairs.
Lovely gift shop, reasonable priced for a change, just don鈥檛 wash you鈥檙e hands to much , this washes off the reentry stamps.
They have little shuttle bushes around the place which are not a bad idea on a hot day.
Already looking forward to our next visit during a different season.",,
,,Stunning views,5,,Really worth a visit for the sights alone there is a walk way through the iconic trees with stunning views of the garden and the bay front .,,
,,Go 3 in 1 Tour,5,,"About 60 dollars Australian. They pick you up from your hotel, take you to tour bus, Next see sound and light show at Gardens on Bay, then Marina Bay Sands, right to the top. Last stop a River cruise , all lights on shore, beautiful. You can then be taken back to your hotel or you can stay, good value",,
,,A unique place for plants lovers,5,,"Just a great place to visit, when in Singapore don't miss it, me and my wife just love it ! Colors and diversity are incredible.",,
,,Stunning,5,,The trees are as incredible as the photos suggest. The gardens are outstanding. Will return with family to make a day of it.,,
,,A must see,5,,The flower dome had a Japanese Blossom display that was spectacular. The permanent wood animal carvings are amazing. The Cloud Forest Dome is also spectacular. So many glorious orchids! Entry for both was SNG$56 for 2 adults and well worth it.,,
,,Not to be missed if ur in Singapore,5,,One of the many attractions in Singapore which cannot missed.... Plz make sure you dont miss the evening light and sound show which hqppens at around 7:45pm,,
,,not to be missed,5,,The Cloud Forest especially was quite amazing and we loved the light show in the giant trees afterwards.,,
,,Nice one,4,,"Lots and lots of flowers and different plants to look around and feel nature , artificially made but still you feel fresh to see the beauty of nature",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"Have been before but enjoyed the revisit. The domes unlike Eden in Cornwall feel cool and comfortable and a welcome respite from the heat. The plants, sculpture and design wonderful",,
,,Wow,5,,I have been to Singapore many times and never been here before. I was very impressed. A visit in both daytime and nighttime is well worth the effort. Very beautiful,,
,,Beautiful and different.,5,,"Went last week and loved this place, very different but beautiful and definitely worth a look, even if you鈥檙e not massively into horticulture like me. Lucky enough to see it at both day and night time also, very pretty at night.",,
,,GBTB,4,,"Gardens By The Bay is just your normal tourist attraction, with admission tickets to see the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. If you are looking for some nature I would recommend cycling there from East Coast Park via Bay East and Marina Barrage. Overall this place is great but best to visit from 6pm to 8am (if you're not going into the paid areas).",,
,,Beautiful,4,,"The gardens are spectacular but wear good shoes.
You could wander around all day through the gardens they are so beautiful but I recommend going in the evening.
It is worth buying a ticket to both domes and giving yourself at least an hour for each before heading to the tree garden for the light show at about 8pm.
Well worth the money and the sore feet.",,
,,Sakura Matsuri,2,,"I had high expectations but the Sakura Matsuri was pretty underwhelming. I was expecting there to be more cherry blossoms but the exhibit turned out to be sparsely populated. It鈥檚 a comfort that the flower dome and cloud forest conservatories are airconditioned.

I took a ride share car going to Gardens but thought I could take the MRT coming back. Big mistake. 15 minute walk under the hot sun with very little shade, appears they provide a shuttle to get to Bayfront MRT though it looked like there was a fee.

Probably good to visit once off but if their special exhibits are anything like the Sakura Matsuri then I wouldn鈥檛 bother coming back.",,
,,Flower dom & cloud forest,5,,"Fantastic loved the ideas behind it, honestly I like the cloud forest more, it鈥檚 amazing a must when u visit Singapore 馃嚫馃嚞",,
,,Worth it!,5,,"Both domes are worth the price of admission... flowers, sculptures and interesting landscaping. The light show at night is great too.",,
,,Enjoying,5,,"This is my second time here at the gardens very enjoyable relaxing place if you love gardens your really love it yourself , if you just visit as a tourist I think Its very still enjoyable lots to see lots of ideas to take home to get inspired. Heading back for the night show is a must see.",,
,,A must when in Singapore.,5,,"Gardens By the Bay have and excellent variety of flowers and plants The visit is well organize, Gardens are very clean.",,
,,Amazing free place!,5,,The Gardens by the Bay are an awesome place to spend hours or just 1 walking about in the Singapore sun. They are so well planned out easy to access via the metro or bus. You can go all around the outside for free only the inside venues require a ticket. If you've got time for the super tree night light show it's worth a watch.,,
,,The gardens by the bay is huge,5,,"The Gardens by the bay is more than Supertree grove and the two domes. A good time to visit is about 4pm. That way you can see the domes, explore the park then see the light show.

We wandered around the park and various garden areas. We were the only ones there in certain areas.

The domes are the only places you need to pay to visit. There are plenty of places online to get a discount.

Supertree grove, the lights and music show is free and is shown at 7.45 and 8.45.",,
,,Nice big place,4,,It's a great place to bring the family. The gmfood choices aren't so bad either. But its too huge and very tiring. And since it's hot in Singapore... you will feel drained. But it's still a very nice place to go to with the kids. They can run around so much because of the wide space.,,
,,The gardens In the middle of the city,5,,"It鈥檚 a 15 mins walk or so from the marina bay sands, you can find these expectalucar gardens by the bay in the middle of the busiest city of singapore! It鈥檚 refreshing and renewing your mind!!",,
,,Simply a must visit when in Singapore,5,,"An inspiring, educational, and enjoyable attraction that is a must see when visiting this amazing city. We visited when the Japaneese garden was in full bloom which exceptionally pretty.",,
,,Nice way to spend a morning,5,,"Saw the programme on TV about the gardens and went to visit. These were built about 10 years ago and there is a skywalk between two of the bigger ""trees"". I think costs about 拢5 to do the walk. Great views especially for a few selfies. Around the trees there is a nice walk. Didnt see too much wildlife living in the trees :( . There is a nice Hawker venue too for a quick lunch. All very good",,
,,A beautiful display of life,5,,Loved this place. Its all about promoting a healthy environment and saving the planet. The trees at night were gorgeous the homes in the day were a wonderful learning environment. Tree Top Drinks had a great view but they charge way to much to go drink there and the service is terrible.,,
,,Must see site for all flowers and nature lovers!,5,,"One of the best nature gardens I ever been. Great thinking and design in each detail, outside at the park and inside in the domes.
At the morning, go to the domes. when I visited, it was heavy raining day, but the domes are excellent for a rainy day trip. One dome full of flowers from all over the world. The other dome is a piece of (nature) art, of evergreen rain forest with all its unique plants. Don't miss the great scent beautiful orchids.
In the park a Japanese zen garden, the great trees (with skyline walk which was closed due to weather condition), unique sculptures, and much more.
At night they have 2 times of dancing lights on the great trees along happy soundtrack.
I have been 3 hours total, but I recommend 3-4 hours.",,
,,Wonderful place to visit!,5,,"It has been one of the most magical, exuberant and beautiful places I have visited! both the domes and the garden around them is something you must visit if you are in Singapore, every night there is a free music and lights show inside the garden area that you can enter without having to buy a ticket.",,
,,Fun day,5,,Wonderful light show and beautiful garden. Views from the sky bridge were amazing. A full day is needed to fully appreciate this attraction and the MRT is convenient located closeby.,,
,,Lota of pweety weetle fwowers,3,,"Sakura exhibit is in operation, there's a small Japanese fair accompanying it. Try out various samplings of Japanese food",,
,,Brilliant day out,5,,The gardens are wonderful and you can walk around most of the areas at no charge. It鈥檚 $28 to get into flower dome and cloud garden but they are stunning. If you don鈥檛 like heights I鈥檇 avoid cloud garden! There is a walkway from the top that鈥檚 a little nerve racking..,,
,,Spectacular gardens worth a visit while in Singapore,4,,"Gardens by the Bay is one of the most well-known and promoted tourist attractions in Singapore, so naturally I felt compelled to visit. I was surprisingly impressed to find that it was more than just a pretty garden with pretty lights -- the Cloud Forest, in particular, is really a spectacular space that wowed me (even as someone who is not ordinarily first in line to look at plants). The immersive rain forest experience is really picturesque, and while I thought the Flower Dome paled in comparison, both of these cooled conservatories were worth a visit for a break from the scorching Singapore heat alone. Definitely worth a stop -- for as much or as little time as you care to spend there (largely depending upon the weather, your interest in the expansive outdoor gardens and with whom you're visiting).",,
,,definitely worth a visit,4,,"I took a taxi to the Gardens from the Marina area. You can certainly walk or take the MRT but it was almost 97 degrees outside and I wanted to save my energy in that heat!
Admission is free, you pay if you want to see the cloud forest or the flower dome. You can also pay separately to walk on the bridge that connects the tall flower looking things. That is $8 SGD.
Very interesting and worth it to check out. Like everything in Singapore it is clean and well run. Take the MRT back out or grab a taxi to wherever you want to go, there are always a few waiting out by the entrance.",,
,,The Big Garden,5,,"This was one of the place that we must come and see in Singapore. Big artificial waterfalls, plenty of plants, very unique, colorful. Cool weather inside the dome. Refresh your body and soul.",,
,,Absolutely fabulous - a must visit in Singapore,5,,"Do not miss this most wonderful creation of Gardens by the Bay. There are two cooled conservatories - the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest - housing plants and trees from all over the world. The conservatories are set in beautiful gardens representing different countries, a cafe, visitor centre and well stocked shop of souvenirs. There is also a Skyway walk above the trees. Such a beautiful place has been created out of nothing and is a credit to Singapore. Easily accessible by bus from Orchard Road or MRT. Allow many hours for your visit. Marine Bay Sands shopping mall connected by a bridge over the road is very close. Enjoy.",,
,,Not allowed to breastfeed,1,,"Went to the Flower Dome this afternoon with my daughters and 4-month old grandson. At one point of our tour, grandson needed to be fed and we found a quiet spot in corner bench. My daughter had on her breastfeeding apron and baby was nicely tucked under it. A young service ambassador named Hani curtly told my daughter that she has to go to the toilet to breastfeed as other visitors may find it offensive. We were appalled by her words as at no time did anyone around us paid us any attention nor gave us any nasty look/remark. When I asked Hani if anyone had made any comments, she said she was just following the rules!! Well, if my daughter had been topless whilst breastfeeding, perhaps I can accept that rule. But she was definitely very covered up compared to some other scantily clad visitors walking right next to head-scarved women in the park. I don鈥檛 see the service ambassador asking them to cover up!! What kind of message is Gardens by the Bay telling the public about your establishment? According to the Singapore Police Force, breastfeeding in public in Singapore is NOT an offence. I respect the laws of the country and I hope Gardens By the Bay had respected the intention of my Daughter to breastfeed my grandson in public whilst appropriately covered up.

I would like to hear from the management what they have to say about this and an apology is in order, I would think.

Our visit has been marred by this unpleasant encounter.",,
,,Definitely a must see,5,,"The gardens by the bay are well worth the walking round and there is a fair bit of walking to be done. There is a shuttle trolley available if needed. There are many different countries in sections showing plants native to for example India, China etc. We went into the flower dome only as cloud dome was closed for maintenance unfort7nately. The flower dome is an experience not to be missed. So many different plants from all round the world flowering at the same time. Amazing. They even had daffodils and hydrangeas etc flowering together. The other item you must do is the skywalk around the trees, amazing, seeing close up the thousands of plants that go to cover the wire trees, a great experience. The sound and light we saw from the hotel balcony and even at that distance was superb. If you like gardens and plants this is the place to go. They also have a gift shop and coffee shop.",,
,,What a colorful garden.,5,,"Be there on time. Go and look for the best spot to enjoy and film this musical light show in the trees. Go there a second time, to enjoy it without the filming.",,
,,Paradise for plant lovers,5,,"Lovingly arranged plants from across the world with spectacular views from a high walkway in the Cloud forest hall. Nice experience to be in a place where daffodils are considered to be 'flowers from very far away' :-)
You can easily spend a full day here, if you enjoy plants.",,
,,Best time to go is post lunch,5,,"A great place not to be missed including its light and sound show which starts daily at 7.45pm.

I suggest you go after lunch and as soon you reach, first grab a garden map and do two dormitories at easy pace. That should take about 2 hours at least.

Then keeping in mind that light and sound show would start at 7.45pm, visit various parts of the garden.

Reach the Super tree OCBC skywalk and grab a place for the show well in time since at about 6.30 pm the place would start filling up. You could do skywalk at around this time so after doing walk you grab a good seat and wait for the show.

If you are four, better take can to/from which would be cheaper than MRT.",,
,,Beautiful place,5,,Went there at sunset time and it鈥檚 amazing. Lots to see. Flowers are beautiful and everywhere. Without paying anything you can see a lot,,
,,Greens and greens,4,,"If you鈥檙e looking for beautiful green gardens to walk around in and photo spots, this is definitely the place. Dont forget your sunscreen, and umbrella.",,
,,"""Light & Sound Show""",4,,This place is free for all. Entrence fee required only to see cloud forest and flower dome. all the plants and tress are amazing and beautiful. visit this place in the evening and complete with light and sound show which was amazing and ofcourse free of cost. loved it very much.,,
,,Visitation to Flower Dome (Sakura Matsuri),4,,"The place is beautifully done. There are many different types of flowers and trees. As the temperature is kept around 4 degrees celsius, it will be good to bring along jacket to keep oneself warm. It is a good place to visit.",,
,,WOW!,5,,"This is a must for every traveller to Singapore, especially in the evening. The 麓trees麓have 2 shows at night too. The lit up garden and Marina Bay Sands Hotel are spectacular.",,
,,Night Light Show,5,,Great venue for a dusk walk accompanied by the sunset light show. Great way to start the night before indulging in Singapore night life,,
,,Beatiful place,5,,It seems that you are in another planet. The plants and the trees are beatiful. The night show with sound and lights is amazing.,,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,A remarkable place to visit. Gardens feature from around the world. I鈥檓 not a gardener but was still very impressed and interested in the huge variety.,,
,,It is getting better every year,5,,"The Sakura Matsuri 2019, cherry blossoms floral display at the Flower Dome of Gardens By The Bay is awesome. This annual event is getting by the year.
Not sure if they have this last year, but in 2019, they are having different ""theme"" each weekend. I visited with my mom at the weekend where they have the Nippon Street or maybe this ""street"" is there the entire Sakura Matsuri Floral display, I cannot recall exactly.

Nevertheless, a highly recommended place to visit. This year the display and the setup really makes one feel they are strolling at the Fushimi Inari Shrine in Kyotom Japan, very nice.

Food streets are great, filled with Japanese food stores and some Japanese-origin products.

If you are a tourist, I highly recommend you to visit this place during weekday to avoid the crowd.",,
,,Wow - a must see!,5,,Excellent value. I would highly recommend visiting the Gardens By The Bay when you visit Singapore. The Cloud Dome and Flower Dome were excellent. Take your time to wander around and enjoy these amazing gardens.,,
,,Amazing place for walking,5,,"Breathtaking view in the garden. You also and enjoy many different kinda local foods and drinks from smal cute stalls there. If you wanna play games, that s right place.",,
,,Review of the Gardens by the Bay,5,,"This was very beautiful. We got off our Celebrity cruise ship and walked to the train station, bought a day pass and took the train there which was very easy. Flowers were very pretty and it was nice to walk around and enjoy the greenery and sights. Would certainly go back as it was very to visit and travel with the train",,
,,Unbelieable,5,,Inside these domes are thousands of plants and sculptures. They are laid out so you follow paths throughout. It also has special themes incorporated. There is a five storey waterfall. The domes have suspended walkways so you can walk over and through the different plants. The plants are all labelled. The gardens are very popular with the local. Bring your camera because you want to take many photos.,,
,,Iconic Area - Extra Fees for Everything!,3,,"We viewed this as a must-see site in Singapore, but were disappointed to find that there were extra fees for all the structures, the shuttle, etc. Unfortunately, we did not have time to go back at night, when the light show is supposed to be spectacular.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"Very nice place to visit every time I鈥檓 in SG, the lights at night are amazing. A lot of walking there so wear comfortable shoes!",,
,,Great place to walk,4,,A very nice location to have a walk in the middle of hectic Singapore. A nice park with incredible artificial trees and art.,,
,,"Fun, Engaging and Diverse",5,,"Easy to get to via Metro and Gardens By The Bay pathways well-marked. We visited during the and returned the next night for the Light Show, which is free and fun.",,
,,First class facility,5,,"The gardens are beautiful and free if you just want a wander but it is really worth the entry fee to access the two huge conservatories. These are amazingly cool considering the exotic plants inside. We caught the cherry blossom exhibition which was very good.
We came across the kids water and play area which looked fantastic.",,
,,Must visit,5,,Its a landmark in Singapore and not to be missed. Coupled with Cloud Dome and OCBC skyway makes it worth every penny.Also there is a free light and sound show everyday (except perhaps once a month for maintenance) .Check the official website for details.,,
,,Super Tree Light Show,4,,"There is free and awesome light show that you can enjoy at night 7.45pm and 8.45pm, go to Super Tree Grove area and enjoy the show",,
,,Uniquely beauty with a cool temp,5,,"The Gardens by the Bay are a very inexpensive way to spend a few hours to enjoy natural beauty and escape the heat. The flower dome is manicured to the finest it can be and there is a team if people keeping it up while you tour the dome. The layout is such that as you walk through you experience environments from around the world, for example, South America, South Africa, California, etc. The flora is each section is native to the particular are but what is really unique is that there are beautiful sculptures nestled in to each section to represent other elements that are native to the area. The cloud forest is also enjoyable and as you climb the tower of trees you are experiencing the natural changes that occur with elevation gain.
From the top of the cloud forest you can see the solar powered trees outside as well as the natural beauty inside. The forest also has an impressive collection of cave crystals.
This is appropriate for individuals or families alike. I highly recommend this stop and even taking your time you will only spend two or three hours. However, if you really love nature, you could spend an entire day!",,
,,Close to Nature,4,,One of the must visit place for any tourist who loves plant life and flowers. This month they are showcasing Sakura in the Flower Dome for this month (they change theme every month) and there is a really good waterfall in the Cloud Forest Section. Don't forget to bring your jackets as it is really cold in the Conservatories.,,
,,Amazing,5,,"We visited Bay of Gardens and was absolutely amazed at the greenery and shrubs and workmanship that has gone into creating all the structures. It is on the bay with beautiful views of the bridge and Marina Bay, the dome is magnificent with a wonderful array of flowers and a waterfall. Although we didn't see the light show at night we have been told it is great.",,
,,Sakuraaaa,5,,"Always love to visit this place especially the flower dome..it was sakura theme at flower dome so it was very beautiful..we just found out that they are not offering any ticket for single dome visit anymore thus you need to buy ticket for both domes, quite okay since the forest dome is good place also..",,
,,Flower Dome in Garden by the Bay,5,,"A MUST visit tourist attraction in Singapore!! They change topics every season, including Sakura, tulips, orchids etc. The flowers are well taken of. This is a ideal place for those who likes to take photos.",,
,,Nice scenery & ambience,3,,"Walked here from boat quay, weather was warm on this day. Don't expect more than a few nice photos. The lights changes & there were some thematic music that went along but that's it. Nothing exceptional.",,
,,Gorgeous gardens,4,,"The Gardens By The Bay in Singapore are amazing! My husband and I took a taxi from the Hilton Singapore to the Gardens on a Wednesday afternoon, and discovered that you can enter at no cost. You must buy a ticket to enter the exhibits, but there is plenty to see without going inside. I particularly enjoyed the Super Tree Groves. The only downside was a lack of laces to eat, since many of the restaurants in the Gardens are not scheduled to open until April 2019.",,
,,Modern Wonders of the world,5,,"Absolutely unmissable. A bit of a trial to get there from the yellow Hop On bus, but absolutely worth it.",,
,,Extremely impressive gardens!,5,,"From waterfalls to gorgeous lights, this place is a must-see! We were there well over an hour and think that we did see everything, but we finally had to sit down and have ice cream from the little stand at the end of the path. It was exquisitely done! Interesting and beautiful. There's also a coffee shop there, so take a break then start back on your journey to the top.",,
,,Cherry blossoms time at the Gardens by the Bay,5,,Enjoy the cherry blossoms at the Sakura Matsuri Floral Display. You can also enjoy the Japanese architectural elements within.,,
,,Holls,4,,Well werth a look round it has been well thought out well pland it鈥檚 very green beautiful tranckle good for families couples good if U can鈥檛 walk round there are little trains that will take you on a tour round,,
,,Mind blowing.,5,,The entire garden is the size of 92 rugby fields. Examples of different kinds of gardens. The skywalk between the super trees is amazing but not available in bad weather. Another must is at least the cloud dome. This might take an hour or more. Do read all the information and watch all short videos. Plan your visit to be there at 19:30 for the light show on and between the super trees and lie down on your back!!,,
,,Great Experience,5,,"Took the MRT to Bayfront station but after a walk through the Marina Bay Hotel we saw a sign to the Gardens by The Bay. This took us out side to a glass lift that went to a high level walk way that took us back through the Hotel but looking down on the lobby area and then out side it continued over another road straight into the Gardens.
If it as hot as it was on your visit I would recommend the shuttle bus service where you can also avoid the queues by buying your tickets for the Domes.
Both Domes are spectacular. We returned later in the week for the evening light show
that lasts about 15mins but is on twice a night,and thats FREE ..",,
,,Ultimate place - must visit,5,,Gardens by the bay is a must visit place of Singapore. There are two things Flower Garden and Cloud Forest.,,

,,AMAZING GARDENS NOT TO BE MISSED,5,,"We heard a lot about these new gardens in Singapore which look amazing on the photos. On our last visit to Singapore we went to see them and were amazed with the concept and the beauty. There is nothing that I could compare these stunning gardens with, you just need to come and see them for yourselves. You will love it.",,
,,Beautiful oasis,5,,"The Gardens by the Bay are a beautiful oasis of plants, water and display. Great place to visit and cool off since the entire structure is air comditioned for the plants. This is a perfect way to spend a couple hours strolling through the lush plants in comfort and a very unique setting.",,
,,Excellent setting and stunning,4,,"Wow, what can one say about this? Awesome? No that鈥檚 not right. Stunning? Maybe.... This is an amazing site and full of beautiful photo opportunities. The evening lighting display takes your breath away. Stop for the first one and just watch, the next get out your camera. Food outlets were a bit of an issue finding them but a brilliant experience",,
,,A very relaxing day out,4,,"We were staying 3 days in Singapore and decided to visit the gardens by the Bay as a priority. We were so impressed by the standard/quality and relaxing atmosphere, that we decided to go again the following day, rather than other attractions which were advertised",,
,,A beautiful oasis,5,,"During the time I lived in Singapore and now when I visit, Gardens by the Bay is a place I always visit. The musical show is something to behold and the views from the bridge connecting it to Marina Bay Sands are amazing. If you go sufficiently late at night, it鈥檚 also very quiet and the weather cools down, making for a great stroll. You won鈥檛 see as many lights late night but after a few visits, that did not bother me.
Absolutely recommend!",,
,,Beautiful,5,,Very busy in the evenings as the light show is completely free but well worth a daytime visit for the sky walk .the trees still look beautiful when not lit up . Plenty of food outlets for a snacks and drinks,,
,,Just superb,5,,"This is one of the most amazing places if you like gardens of the world. The setting is spectacular and the scale immense. Even on a rainy day it was great to visit. It's on lots of levels but plenty of lifts if you have mobility problems. If you do have mobility problems start at the top and come down.Leave plenty of time, there is so much to see.",,
,,Boring,2,,Nothing spectacular and very crowded. Even the nightly show at the Super Trees Grove are not that entertaining. I left the 2 domes early because of the excessive crowd.,,
,,What a light show!,5,,"Fantastic place to walk,true Singapore skyline. lightshow brilliant, a magical evening.This place made my stay in Singapore memorable",,

Cloud forest replicates tropical mountain regions.
As soon as u enter cloud forest u can see huge indoor water fall.

,,Amazing!,5,,"Its really beautiful human creation! You feel as you are in future. A lot og green, monuments and amazing way in the sky",,
,,Super good infrastructure,5,,"Super cool place with nice man made architecture complimented with nature's wonder. For a man made efforts at creating an eden's garden, this is one of the best and sincere efforts. Well worth the trip and the surroundings are nicely curated. A pleasant comfortable environment and a fine balance between man made and nature's effort at giving us creature's comfort but yet nature at it's best .",,
,,Awesome,5,,An awesome experience... try to go on the flower before the forest around 17:00 so after you can enjoy the lighting and music show at 19:45 of the trees.,,
,,"Its an Ok place, can skip the night show",3,,"If you have been to Vegas, you will be so disappointed by the light show here. Do not plan to come for that show specifically like we did. Its over hyped. You will anyways see it in the night at least once while driving by in Singapore. Plan to do the sky walk instead, that's really a different experience",,
,,Visit to Singapore's Gardens By The Bay,5,,"The place was quite eye- catching and the view from there was memorable. Also, a light show is held every evening which just completely seems to be the icing on the cake..",,
,,Fantastic day and night,5,,"What a great place to visit. Went a few times while there as one of the flower domes was out for maintenance. Both the flower dome and the cloud forest were amazing and we were especially grateful that they were air conditioned. (Note get a re entry stamp when you leave so you can duck back in to cool off after walking around the outside). Went back again for the light show at night and it was a great show and viewing was easy as you just sat or stood amongst the trees.
You can get the big red bus there, taxi or you can walk through from the marina bay hotel or shopping centre.
Only cost is for the domes or the skywalk otherwise walk around for free.
A must do in Singapore.",,
,,Visit to garden by the bay,5,,"This is certainly a must visit bucket list for all visitors to Singapore. The two domes offer varying types of experience amd exhibit.

,,Flowers galore!,4,,"Gardens By The Bay changes its flower theme every quarterly so visitors are able to see different kinds of flower themes and decorations which came along with it. The first time I visited Gardens By The Bay, I was so happy with it that I bought the annual pass. They also made improvements along the way for visitors, both locals & foreigners to get access to their place easily, like providing rides for a fee (return trip), free for those on wheelchairs to able to purchase entrance tickets together with the rides. It is a must-visit for both locals and foreigners.",,

There are also audio tours, and information on the plants, which can educate botany enthusiasts. The domes are really nicely laid out and you walk in cool comfort. The flower dome changes themes regularly, and hence you dont feel jaded with repeated visits. The light show at night is beautiful and it really lifts your spirit and makes you happy!",,

,,Amazing,4,,So many species and so many details to look after.... this a must go of Singapore definitively. I like it,,

,,Lovely walk higher up or lower down.,4,,"The trees are a pretty impressive sight, especially if you walk among them at the higher level. We went during the day but can imagine they are even more impressive at night. You can visit the indoor gardens but in the time we had didn't have the opportunity. There are charges for visiting them and the Skywalk, but the views from the Skywalk enable you to have some really impressive photos from a higher level. We walked around the outdoor gardens after and they were beautiful. Be careful to cover up in the height of summer as the sun doesn't half frazzle you on a hot day. McDonalds on site for refreshments.",,
,,Enchanting,5,,"If you are short on time, do the rainforest first. It is breathtaking! We ventured here for a short day (out of the heat, the area is cooled), and were blown away. We live in Hawaii, so we were a little luke warm, thinking same things we may see at home, but even if they were, the presentation is magnificent. The other pavilion had a beautiful flower display, but the rainforest, with its catwalks and waterfall were out of this world. I would definitely recommend this!",,
,,Disappointed- although nice and cool temperature,2,,Not impressed- to be honest I think the free gardens outside are far superior. Was way to expensive for what it was... the only good thing was that it was much much cooler which was a relief in the heat. If you have limited time- I鈥檇 recommend skipping this. Just looked a little messy to me and the main interest was the window washers who were scattered around the building like spider man.,,
,,Fantastic,5,,"Had an afternoon free between flights, passing through Singapore and made the decision to visit as we didn鈥檛 have time on our previous stop over. So glad we did as this place was just so beautiful and impressive. Lots of different areas to explore but the trees were spectacular. Unfortunately we did not have time to stay and see the trees lit up at night but it鈥檚 already on our list to return next year for a few days.",,
,,Night show,5,,Fabulous free night light show . Buy your MRT tickets before you travel as the queues to get them following this event is horrendous and the machines don鈥檛 accept the larger denomination notes,,

,,Must visit attraction in Singapore,5,,"Very nice experience. Give at least 4-5 hours to see the 2 domes, the super trees and outside gardens.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,"We were there first thing in the morning to beat the rush. Its a great day out, plenty to see and if you can do the canape walk i would recommend it the views are fantastic and very reasonably priced., I wouldn't do this with small children though, i just don't think you'll get the same experience up there, that's my just my view.
Take your lunch and sit and have a picnic there is plenty of places to sit and just chill there.",,

While entry to the park is free i definitely recommend getting tickets for the domes..the flower dome is just ok but the cloud forest in really wow..i got the tickets from Klook and they could just be scanned directly from my mobile..,,
,,A great place to visit!,5,,"We went back to the Gardens by the Bay after a 5 year gap specifically to see them again. They are spectacular and I recommend anyone to visit. The outside gardens are free to walk around, you pay to enter the Cloud Garden. It鈥檚 all clean and well tended though be sure to take plenty of water; temperatures are always high 20Cs or above! The Cloud Garden is beautiful. Possibly need a head for heights as you walk down outside the garden but it鈥檚 well worth it. Fabulous.",,
,,A bit like the Eden project on steroids!,5,,"This is a wonderful experience, plants and flowers from around the world in massive glass houses. Incredibly clean and tidy, not a leaf out of place!",,

,,Great,4,,Okay so I have been here 4 times. It's a great place to come to once in your life especially if you like flowers or the construction of such giant domes with many different plant species. The outside area is ridiculously hot so make sure you come with water and maybe even an umbrella. The night show is a must to do and happens twice every night. Also if you're not afraid of heights walk to OCBC sky bridge. If you have kids there's a kid's water park. And if hungry there's satay by the bay for some local food.,,
,,Well worth a visit,4,,An easy bus ride away from Clarke Quay. Reasonable entrance price but costs extra to go into the domes. Didn't get to see them at night unfortunately.,,

I would go the the two domes in the afternoon starting at 2 pm and then the OCBC Skyway in the Supertrees in the evening. Maybe check out and go eat at the Saytay by the Bay food court for some very affordable food. There is also a Children's Garden between the Cloud Forest and Saytay by the Bay. Out of the domes the Cloud Forest is my personal favorite, be sure to not miss the MOVIE on the ground floor after you walk through! My kids, and me as well were very interested in the educational area right before the movie and the movie well as they were learning and being reinforced what was being taught at their school.",,
,,Amazing excellence.,5,,"You must pay the $28 spd's to enter both of the domes. Absolutely mind boggling design and presentation. If you can go up tower 3 of the ""boat hotel"" to watch the light show in the gardens at either 7:45 or 8:45pm. A wonderful spectacular colourful show.",,

This is my 1st time seeing the Sakura in full bloom. They are so beautiful. I鈥檓 very happy to see the different colours and varieties of the flowers. There are many people who do not have the opportunity to travel to Japan to see the Sakura. Thus, the Sakura Matsuri Floral display allows more people to experience, enjoy n know more about the Sakura flowers.
I will definitely want to visit Japan during the Sakura season.",,
,,Amazing,5,,"We went the first day to look around in daylight, it was so good we went again the next day at about 4 pm and stayed until the evening for the light show, it was amazing",,
,,Highly recommended,4,,"Gardens aren鈥檛 usually the most exciting of places. Sure, if you are a huge flower fan or are really into ponds, they might be the highlight of your holiday, but to your average person they are just pleasant places to kill an hour or 2. Gardens by the bay is different, a futuristic wonder beamed down from space that might just be the best tourist attraction in Singapore.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay is Uniquely Singapore!,5,,"Each visit to the Gardens by the Bay is a lovely experience, even for a local like me.

The themed Gardens at the Flower Dome offers a variety throughout the entire calendar year from Poinsettias to Dahlias to Sakuras, Tulips, Roses and Orchids.

The display of flowers at the Flower Dome are well coordinated and it never fails to attract crowds of visitors from both Singapore and overseas.

The Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are cool and the seasonal changes of flora in the Flower dome make every visit a refreshing experience. You don't have to leave Singapore to be able to enjoy sakuras, tulips, begonias, roses and many other exotic plants. The cool mist in the cloud forest is a great welcome, especially on a hot day. Here a huge variety of orchids and other shade loving plants is a feast for your eyes. Visit Gardens by the Bay at night and you will be entertained by glittering lights on the super trees, dancing to the rhythm of music. Take a stroll on the OCBC skywalk and you can enjoy the garden from an elevated viewpoint. This is place not to be missed whenever you visit Singapore.",,

Must visit at night time.",,
,,A must see,4,,"Artfully done. The light show at night is nice. I would have preferred a more mystical type of music, but that's personal choice. If you buy tickets online for the special parts, make sure you read where you have to pick up the tickets.",,

,,High Tea,5,,"We were invited to the cafe for high tea to celebrate our nephew's daughter 1st birthday. The food served although in small portion was well presented.

,,An absolute must.,5,,"Not only is Singapore a great place to visit ( fantastic cheap food, amazing shopping, beautiful people) the gardens in the bay is a world class, not to be missed floral display that will take your breath away. Never have i seen so many varieties of Orchid in one place(100s of them) the colours have to be seen to be believed. Outside in the evening there is a sincronised musical light show which is free (thousands turn up for it) Do yourself and your family a favour make Singapore a holiday destination you won't regret it.",,
,,Nice but..,4,,"A very nice place to visit for free so I would skip the 2 domes or the skywalk if I come again.

The whole area is amazing and work of art but a little bit expensive for what it offers.

I didn鈥檛 enjoy the light show to be honest. I found it average and left few minutes later.",,
,,Nice,5,,Worth a visit if you are in Singapore. This is a nice attraction to visit. It is convenient to get to via public transportation or taxi,,
,,nice place,5,,"a very nice place to visit, i was late to come that night, i miss a few song but its still nice and worth it to see with a person we love. such a nice place, will come visit again for sure.",,
,,Gardens by the bay,5,,"The gardens by the bay are fantastic, each time I visit ( at least 3 to 4 times ) a year, the different displays are all superb. Visited most recently with small children and the kids really enjoyed the water play area also. Not to missed on a visit to Singapore",,
,,Out of this world,5,,"Put your shoes on and just walk , its fantastic especially at night . So much to see and to enjoy. Good for old and young",,
,,Just Beautiful & Perfect,5,,"As we walked through this elegant garden it definitely took our breath away, so much to see and well set out with hidden plants displayed to catch your eyes in all directions. We had the opportunity to stop and think about 'climate change' our environment and what we can do to contribute and preserve our beautiful plants & the earth.",,
,,A must to see and do. Stunning.,5,,Beautiful gardens and the cloud Forrest is a definite must to do. Took three children 6yrs 11yrs and 15yrs all of which thoroughly enjoyed themselves. A great documentary at the end showing climate change and how we can all help to change and look after this beautiful planet.,,
,,Gardens by the Sea - Flower and Cloud Dome,5,,What an amazing site and exhibition. Not too over crowded and easy to get around. The Orchid displays were just gorgeous and so many varieties.

,,Just beautiful,5,,The cloud gardens are definitely not to be missed. A must see if you can get to visit the site. Just amazing,,
,,Amazing,5,,The collection of plants and flowers was amazing and the way they were presented. Also the waterfall is amazing and the concept to provoke idea to save environment and planet was fantastic.,,
,,Wonderful!!!,5,,"This is a must see when visiting Singapore.
The Supertrees must be seen at light for the sound and light show. Amazing!
The Greenhouses are out of this world and very reasonably priced. The UK would charge a lot more for less...
The gardens are beautiful and the food court exceptional- try the chicken satay!",,
,,Marvellous garden with modern landscape,5,,Gardens by the Bay is an amazing garden in the middle of a city and well worth a visit. Various sections throughout the garden blend effectively into an incredible site. The light show was marvelous. It's a must visit place.,,
,,Put this on your to do list,5,,"The whole Gardens by the Bay precinct, like most things in Singapore, is another planning success. To start with, the area is easily reached by public transport and has plenty of shops, ammenities and food outlets. Visit the Flower Dome and cloud forest during daylight hours, then enjoy the super trees by night. There's a wonderful light show each night and the whole area has a settling and peaceful feeling about it. Not far away is satay by the bay, where a good feed is waiting for you. You can even bike or segway around as a walking alternative. Spend some time reading the descriptions of how the complex is self sustaining. All in all, a visit to Singapore must include a day and night visit to this precinct. Highly recommened.",,
,,This is a must for anyone in Singapore!,5,,"The Gardens were beautiful to see and there is a lot to see too. The famous trees are fantastic to touch and look at, especially if only previously admired on tv. Other parts of the gardens are beautiful too. Everything is looked after so well and the whole garden is clean and great to walk around. The walkway between the trees is a must but be careful if you don't enjoy heights as it moves a little in the wind. I am not usually one for this sort of thing but I did it, holding on all the way. It is worth it! Only part of the Gardens that is busy is the Cloud Forest. It is fantastic and really worth a look but it can be busy and there is no limit to the numbers going in at a time. There is also a great childrens area that every wee one would love.",,
,,Amazing experience for the whole fam,5,,"We enjoy the different themes so there is always something new to look forward to. Great place to bring friends from overseas. It should be on every ones ""must visit"" list",,
,,Gardens by Night,5,,"The Gardens by the Bay is well worth an all day visit. I did the little bus tour and the walkway, but the real highlight is the evening light show among the giant trees. There are two free shows, which are often busy. There is too much to do in the heat in one visit, so I would take a rest after the day visit.",,
,,Green in the middle of the city,5,,"No time is ever enough to spend here. You can be someone who loves plants, or someone who just loves nature - you will never want to leave from here. An extremely wonderful place to spend time in the midst of the green.",,
,,Wonderful Experience,5,,Spent a morning wandering around these fabulous gardens and we were overwhelmed by the sheer beauty of the exhibits. The orchids in particular are amazing and the plants from countries all over the world are set out in beautiful displays. At night the garden takes on a whole different life and is really a must see in Singapore.,,
,,Need to go back more often,4,,"We only had 3 hours to go there which wasn鈥檛 enough. I recommend you to take an audio guided van tour to have an overview of the garden which was huge. I went to the floral dome which not only had the seasonal flowering plants on show, they had one small f the best Succulents and Cycads I鈥檝e ever seen, better than most botanical gardens in Europe. Probably only a few US gardens could match their collections. Their collections were like picking the best specimens to be shown. And it was aircond.
I didn鈥檛 walk in the garden outside much as I didn鈥檛 have time and it was very hot. I鈥檇 suggest the winter time would help a bit.
I would love to go back to visit their another dome, cloud forest, on my next visit.
In summary: a world class garden.",,
,,Loved it all,5,,"Fantastic, don鈥檛 miss it. Very busy on a hot day. The Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are beautiful, filled with plants from all around the world and very colourful. The Garden Tree structures at night are a special sight.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,"An amazing experience, we paid for two attractions, the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest. Both of which are an absolute must if visiting Singapore. We thought the Flower Dome was amazing but were blown away with the Cloud Forest.
Lots of eatery鈥檚 around and toilets so facilities were great.
The Gardens themselves are free and again are beautiful but it鈥檚 a hot walk around so have water.",,
,,Great day out,5,,"What a wonderful collaboration of nature and technology. The whole experience here is one of amazement. The design, size and imagination of the gardens is great. This is definate must do.",,
,,Excellent ambience to visit at night,5,,"This attraction is best visited post 5pm, with the sun close to setting. Easily accessed by mrt or a walk over the bridge from Marina Bay Sands, Gardens By The Bay is one of the nicest modern attractions in Singapore. The various gardens are worth a walk through, the wet playground for kids is fun and the light show offered twice every night is a must see - all of these are free of charge. The two domes are pricey to enter, and of value if there is a special exhibition on. Else, the rest of the gardens have enough to keep a visitor happy without the price tag of the dome tickets. Give yourself at least 2 hours here and add on about 45 minutes each for the domes.",,
,,Great running and walking location,4,,Ran through park to enjoy scenery. Although path for running is not clear. No clear signs for pedestrians. It works if just walking through. Fragrant garden with sculptures and fountains. Beautiful to visit at night as well. Must visit.,,
,,Well worth a visit,5,,"A must when in Singapore. We visited late afternoon, had a snack then took in the light show in the evening which was spectacular.",,
,,Beautifully maintained,4,,"The gardens are spectacular! The conservatories are a nice break from the sweltering Singapore heat, although they are a bit pricey for what they are.",,
,,Fab evening,5,,Arrived just in time to get tickets for the odbc skywalk. Light show great. We eat here food OK usual fast food. Highly recommended,,
,,Beautiful,5,,Must visit for Singapore. If you're here you've got to visit at least once. Prepare for crowds on the weekend.,,
,,Amazing,5,,I have seen nothing like this place before. It is beautiful and there is so much to see. The cloud forest is worth a visit and make sure to stay for the light show at night it is insane!,,
,,Breathtaking,5,,I was hesitant at first but glad I went. Let鈥檚 get one thing straight these big bubbles are cool inside so it is a pleasure strolling through winding paths full of plants and flowers. Again a must do in Singapore,,
,,Incredible,5,,"The gardens by the bay are incredible! The cloud forest by far exceeded all my expectations, I was walking around in awe!",,
,,Supertree Grove and Skywalk,4,,"This review is only about the Supertree Grove and Skywalk.

A must visit destination to spend your evening in Singapore.

The Supertree Grove lights and sound show is scheduled at 7:45pm and 8:45pm and lasts 15 minutes. It's open for all and there are no entry fees.

The Skywalk costs SGD 8 per adult and SGD 5 per child. If you are lucky, get Skywalk entry ticket for 7:30pm or 8:30pm so you can possibly be up there when light show begins!

Great experience indeed.",,
,,Well worth a visit,5,,Allow plenty of time. Great floral display on a the time I visited. Less crowds late afternoon. Looks different at night.,,
,,Beautiful!,5,,This was a beautiful experience. They have so many different flowers to see and the different vibrant colors just create a positive mood/atmosphere. The only downside it is busy.,,
,,A must visit attraction,5,,Great place to see at night. Amazing light show after 8pm. Get there early for a spot and enjoy the music.,,
,,Urban Jungle,5,,A urban Structure made with lot of care for eco sustainability. U have to visit this by day to see the effort they had put and by night for the fantastic light show.,,
,,Garden by the Bay,5,,A very pleasant surprise not your average flower garden. It truly one of a kind. It was a worthwhile use of my time.,,
,,Greens everywhere- refreshing,5,,"Paid to visit the indoor displays the last time that I was here, this time I was just wondering around the park, nonetheless beautiful scenery, great skyline view towards merlion park, and don鈥檛 forget about the night show!",,
,,Not just for flower lovers 馃槈,5,,In the Gardens by the Bay you can spend some nice hours. Especially the Floral Fantasy seems to be very interesting for smaller children. Altogether I would plan four hours for the visit.,,
,,As amazing as you'd think,5,,"Such a stunning, breathtaking experience. I went twice in a day. Pick a time of day that is not too hot - after my first trip down I returned to my hotel drenched in sweat - regretted that. I think it is probably worth it to lay beneath the trees for the night show - but you better get there early because it is outrageously packed to do so.",,
,,Amazing,5,,"The gardens are amazing with so much to see and do and the chargeable attractions ( the domes, floral fantasy and the skywalk ) are fantastic although as they are popular the earlier you go the better. The Light and music show in the skygrove at night is excellent then you can walk down to the Meadow and see the Planet ( giant baby) all lit up in glorious white light then the bamboo grove is lit also and the hugh dragonfly statues on the lake are amazing. There is a chargeable shuttle bus and an audio tour also.",,
,,Great Senary,5,,Great Green-Space in a city. Save time for a day and nigwht visit This is a place you will see many pictures of Great to say I have been there,,
,,Beautiful gardens for free!,5,,This is a must see. Such a beautiful well kept park. Go and see the show for 7.45 you will not be disappointed 馃槉,,
,,Amazing,5,,"We visited both domes and even our teenage children enjoyed them. The displayed were fantastic with plants you might not even have heard of. Both domes were quite chilly, which I found surprising. The Bay Gardens are lovely and the super tree light show (19:45 & 20:45) is stunning. Arrive in plenty of time to find somewhere to sit. We had to sit on the floor and it was hot and hard!",,
,,Nice attraction but crowded,3,,"We visited the Gardens by the Bay on a weekend, which was probably not the best choice. Things were very crowded. We did the sky walk, which was nice, but the staff was constantly asking folks to move ahead since there were long lines. The views are interesting, but probably not worth the price. On a less crowded day, we might have had a different feeling.",,
,,Lovely seeing the garden in the cool of aircontinitioning.,4,,"I enjoyed my visit to Gardens by the bay. I loved the array of plants. The only frustrating thing for me was, I would have liked more signage on the plants, naming them and the countries they were from or can be found in. There was a 1000-year-old olive tree from Spain but we only knew that information because we were standing near a guide at the time. I don't necessarily want to use the headphones to get that information.
Well worth a visit and it can be even better if given more information.",,
,,"Beautiful experience, each time.",5,,"We visited the gardens several times. Arriving late afternoon and stayed for 1-2 hours until after sunset.
Use MRT to Bayfront, walk underground to park or via Marina Bay Hotel on walkway.
Beautiful art, light show recommended. Food / drinks options.
Ending up in fantastic shopping areas if you have teen girls",,
,,Treat yourself,4,,"We spent hours at the Gardens - simply stunning, and done so well. The cloud walk is ok, so I'd give this a miss if you are strapped for time.",,
,,A must see,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is a beautiful place to visit, with so much to see and do. Make sure that you see the night time light show",,
,,Bucket List Tick!,5,,"Definitely a must and worth a trip to Singapore just to see it. The gardens are breathtaking, superbly maintained and magnificently displayed. Allow a full day. Worth paying the extra to visit the Cloud and Flower domes. There's also a light display at night which is worth seeing. We enjoyed a delicious variety of hawker food at the Satay by the Bay inside the complex.",,
,,Must see,5,,Stunning place . Lovely to walk around and take it all in. Can get very busy entering and leaving. Getting a taxi back to your hotel is not so easy . Long ques .,,
,,Incredible place,5,,"Wow! This is a must see for anyone. Words can't express how amazing this place is. From the biggest indoor waterfall to all the flowers from around the world, the music and light shows. You have to visit if you are in Singapore.",,
,,Spectacular,5,,This is very much worth a visit. Loved walking around the gardens and especially the trees. I only went during the day and cannot wait to come back after dark.,,
,,Floral Fantasy,5,,"This is a new attraction at Gardens by the Bay. I am 55 and i enjoyed this 4D offering of Floral Fantasy the Flight of a Dragonfly. The garden before the theater is soo amazing with the variety of plants, flowers etc. If you are an enthusiast you would be enthralled with this place. Altho theres a bit of waiting time before the theater, its all worth it!! Any generation would definitely enjoy this new offering. It costs sg$20, a bit pricey for me at first, but after this experience, i am a convert and totally a fan of anything Singaporean",,
,,Excellent light show,5,,Great to wander around in the day and worth paying to go inside the two conservatories. Well-organised like everything in Singapore. Very busy when we went on a hot July afternoon but crowds handled well by staff. The 7.45pm light show was fantastic (and I鈥檓 very sceptical about gimmicks like this) but it was dramatic and entertaining - well worth staying for. And then a nice walk along the gardens passing the Marina Bay Sands Hotel (the Skyview observation deck is worth going up here for fantastic views across Singapore and the bay) and towards the Singapore Flyer. A really good attraction.,,
,,Stunning ecosystems with strong environmental sustainability message,5,,"You can tailor your experience to include various components, some free, others attract an entry fee.
I would recommend visiting the domes (cloud forest and the flower dome) as well as traversing the suspended walkway between two Supertrees and enjoy the magnificent vista. Take a good camera!",,
,,WOW!,5,,Plan to spend several hours year. We were amazed at all the flowers and plants they had. Such a nice afternoon when it was hot and a bit rainy. Most of this is indoors.,,
,,Wonderful Garden鈥檚,4,,"We had 4 hrs in Singapore after returning from cruise, while we came out we hired a taxi for 3 hrs and asked him to take us for a quick tour of city . The first stop over was this garden. We immediately bought tickets and took a battery operated vehicle, the tour of garden lasted for 15 minutes. You can see trees from all over the world . You can see old 鈥?Bargad 鈥?tree while passing by Indian garden. You can see many variety of trees & flowers.",,

,,Great experience - we went 2 nights in a row,5,,This is really a very beautiful experience. Remember that the shows are at 7.45 PM and 8.45 PM. Come in good time so you can both see the Super Trees both from a distance and lay just under them.,,
,,Great Gardens,5,,"Great Garden experience. Definitely a must see when in Singapore. Extremely clean, well kept and the Super Trees are awesome. Gift shop on site",,
,,A must,5,,This is a must do attraction on an evening in Singapore. Lasts about 15-20 minutes. We did this as part of a package A Night Out,,
,,An Unexpected Delight,5,,"It may not look like much from a distance, but once you get there, you realize there is much more to this attraction. The park itself meanders for quite a distance with sculptures and specialty gardens鈥攅ven an amphitheater. When it gets too warm (or rainy) visit The Cloud Forest and Flower Domes where you can spend hours photographing flowers and plants you have probably never seen before. Fascinating place. Get your hand stamped to come back later, or after dark. Don鈥檛 miss it.",,
,,A must see when in Singapore,5,,"This place is absolutely amazing. If you plan on staying over in Singapore, even for a short time, make sure to visit the gardens by the bay. if you are lucky enough to be there at night, you have to see the light show that is offered every night. It is absolutely amazing. This city is really clean with the friendliest of people and definitely very futuristic. A must see for people of all ages. Get there a little before the show starts to get the perfect spot as it tends to fill up rather quickly.",,
,,A nice afternoon stroll here,3,,"Went here with my husband for an afternoon stroll. It was nice to take a walk in the garden filled with many plants and flower. We started the journey on foot from the MBS side until the Cloud Forest dome. We took the shuttle for a return (SGD7).

My overall experience : 3.5/5",,
,,Amazing,5,,"Good for family and friends, will definitely bring my friend here when they visit Singapore 馃帀馃帀 馃槏馃槏",,

,,Nice way to spend a few hours,4,,Beautiful flowers on display and great to see the place in the large greenhouses in the clouds and the skyway walk. Can get very hot waking outside for any length of time so come prepared. The food and drink outlets are expensive and crowded but not quite as bad as the Marina Bay Sands Hotel over the road. We plan to see the night show separately as it can be very busy to combine it with an afternoon viewing.,,
,,Spectacular,5,,Don't miss these fabulous gardens if you are in Singapore. Make sure you allow plenty of time as there is much to see and it is all so very beautiful.,,

,,Fantastic place to visit,5,,Fantastic place to visit and would highly recommend going both day and night. Flight of the dragonfly is great!,,
,,Best botanical Garden in the world,5,,"I believe it鈥檚 a one of the best botanical garden in the world without any comparison.

Located next to Marina Reservoir, Gardens by the Bay offers breath-taking waterfront views. This multi-award winning horticultural destination spans 101 hectares of reclaimed land, and is made up of two main areas - South Bay Garden and East Bay Garden.

Lovely waterfall scenic can give you a feeling of natural waterfall all the way from the mountains.

From the waterfront promenade, you will see a picturesque view of the city skyline.

Unique to Gardens by the Bay is the Cloud Forest in lush vegetation amidst the world鈥檚 tallest indoor waterfall.

You will find many restaurants & posh eateries around you to dine with your family.

,,Blew me away,5,,"Do not miss this Singapore treasure. I鈥檓 still in awe. This is an incredible feat of engineering! I can鈥檛 even wrap my head around what it must take to maintain this masterpiece to horticulture. If I lived there, I would go there weekly. Just amazing!",,
,,Gardens at Singapore,4,,"A lovely afternoon
Well presented the staff were great and friendly
My main fault was that you could not near by stop and have a small snack or bite to eat
The facilities this area were poor.
Also lack of water fountains , considering the weather their should have been more.
Overall a great day",,
,,A do not miss place in Singapore,4,,"A Great and a beautiful creations. A pleasant walk in the evening. Beyond description, so visit to experience this fantastic place and country for yourself.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"Beautiful place to visit, lots to do here which we underestimated and ran out of time. If going up the trees you do need a time slot before entering the que so make sure to go and get your time before standing in the que. They had a toy story theme when we where here which was amazing and we got up the trees just in time for the toy story light show starting.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,Beautiful garden feel very good and refresh there. Must visit when you come to Singapore. It's opposites Marina bay hotel,,
,,"Stunning, unique experience",5,,"Definitely worth visiting, especially because most of it is free! I don't know of something like this in any other city. Great to walk around on a sunny day",,
,,A wonder of the world,5,,The creation of gardens representing all parts of the globe is truly something not to be missed. What a wonderful way to spend a day in Singapore,,
,,Stunning!,5,,"We loved Gardens by the Bay. We were staying at Marina Bay Sands and had a birds eye view of the night time light show. We did pay to go into the domes and they were amazing! We were lucky enough to be walking on the Skywalk when one of the light shows were on which was really special. Just a warning that if you have bought your tickets for the domes on line and they include the skywalk, you still have to go to the ticket office to get a time to go up. We didn't and had to argue our case for this. Luckily we got to go up",,
,,Wonderful Visit,5,,"If you want to have a pleasant and informative walk in an amazingly beautiful garden, this is the place to be. Remember not to miss the 19.45 Garden Rhapsody light show by the Supertree Grove! Grab a beer and chill on the grass and enjoy the show.",,
,,A must see during your visit to Singapore,5,,"What an incredible place!
The gardens are stunning! Well tended and so clean. The plants and flowers are beautiful and it is a very lovely place to walk around. It covers a large area.
The gardens themselves are open until 2 am so gorgeous to see in the evening.
We wanted to visit the domes as well- there are two- and we did but as we were told the gardens were open until 2 am we assumed the domes would be as well. They actually close at 8pm so we just about managed to dash around quickly. A real shame as they were stunning. We could have spent hours there.
The gardens are free to enter but the domes are ticketed. Excellent price for the beauty within.
I recommend you make this a part of your visit.",,
,,Really Fantastic Could Not Recommend Enough,5,,This just a fantastic area of Singapore to visit with the highlight the rainforest and flower domes which really are quite stunning. Yes it gets busy and yes there are lots of people taking pictures but once you get over this frenzy there is so much to see and the surrounding gardens equally amazing spaces.,,
,,Special Place,4,,"A space created for nature. If you think of it it is a garden with fake trees. But it is so well organized, build and take care of. I really enjoy the visit!!!",,
,,Unique and Super Experience,5,,"Our main incentive to travel to Singapore was to visit Gardens by the Bay. And we can say that I exceed our expectations. It is super exciting and impressive to see so much variety and beauty in one place. We visited the three Dome and everything else. There is no doubt that it is a unique place, where you can perceive the intelligence, love and interest that our Creator had, Jehovah God in creating everything because every detail and design proves it. Going through the OCBC skyway was something super exciting. And you definitely can't miss the show they give at night in the Supertree Groove. It was a super long trip but it was worth it. We recommend it at 100%.",,
,,Best Garden of singapore!,5,,"Well i love flora and gardens! I visit gardens once every month especially flower dome. They have seasonal differnt setups of flower so frequent visitors dont feel bored with same showcase. Also never forget to enjoy the garden raphsody show which happens twice every day at evening!

Small secret : if you just wanna go to flower dome and no other conservatory then better grab a cup of tea/coffe at fennel cafe (past named as pollen terrace) so you can get free excess to Flower dome

Note : Please check the gardens by the bay website to see the events and showcase going on and also if you are like me (who likes to visit garden frequently like me, every 鈥渏une to july end鈥?there is 50% off for 1 year membership promotion titled as friends of the garden, you can go for this :)",,
,,Too crowded,3,,It's really crazy... Every where you look... People queuing or taking pics.. Very hard to get a photo of myself alone with plants..queue for taxi almost half hour to go back... Makes me not want to come back..,,
,,Must see,4,,"Went with my bestie, her hubby and her 13 year old son-whilst shrubs trees and flowers aren't quite up to Lego he still had a good time and enjoyed the whole experience. We of course loved it",,
,,Simply Amazing,5,,"This is a wonderful place to visit, it covers many acres, as well as the stunning gardens within the domes- filled with gardens depeciting different regions throughout the world. Ther are also the outside gardens, the meadow area, the dragonfly lake. Lots of facilities to eat, purchase souviners - we used the oppurtunity to use the guided audio tour by electric car to enable us to get a feel for the size of the whole grounds -well worth the $8 cost. The display of orchids within the dome are spectatular - despite many vivitors the site is so large it doesnt feel too packed - Highly Highly recommended",,
,,Must Visit,5,,"A must-see, both Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. Also Supertree Grove and the nightly free light and sound show.",,
,,"Cloud forest yes, flower dome maybe, skip the floral fantasy",4,,"We visited in the daytime and so stuck with the indoor part of the gardens to stay cool. Really liked the Cloud forest - it has a lovely waterfall and lots of pretty exotic and interesting plants which we took a leisurely two hours to visit. Next we went to the flower dome, with the seasonal exhibit of orchids. It is very beautiful exhibit - that we enjoyed, but could be skipped if you are short on time. Final, we visited the floral fantasy exhibit - which featured some lovely flowers and a 10 min 鈥?D鈥?ride which is pretty much an infomercial for the Gardens. Unless you are planning a bunch of selfies with flowers or like infomercials, this was a total waste of money IMHO.

Since we were there in the middle of the day, we didn鈥檛 do much outdoors. We hope to go back when it is cooler to see the outdoors and hopefully stay for a light show.",,
,,Floral Fantasy,5,,"1) It鈥檚 a great pleasure to visit Floral Fantasy, the scenery was fantastic, and staying there longer to enjoy the greenery and flowers makes one feel very relaxed and calm. The 4D ride and video was very enjoyable it could be better if video is made slightly longer.",,
,,Not so stunning & expensive for a tourist,3,,"The price quite expensive, and we need to purchase EXTRA $3 for just a shuttle. which i thought the shuttle will drop at several places, but it鈥檚 not. it鈥檚 only from the ticketing office to somewhere nearby the MRT. should just get a free shuttle for those kind of price range.
garden by the bay more like statue by the bay when i visited last week (july) quite disappointed.",,
,,Really beautiful and natural,5,,The first place to visit in little Singapore ;). The botanical garden by the bay has thousands of plants.,,
,,Wish we could have actually seen it!!,2,,"We came to see the Garden Rhapsody sound & light show. We'd looked forward to it for some time, arrived in Singapore & made a special trip to the Gardens to see the evening show. Unfortunately we arrived to find that the area where the Garden Rhapsody is held, had been fenced off, with a Christmas display inside - only accessible if you paid for entry. When the Garden Rhapsody is usually a free event, we were bitterly disappointed. We had no interest in seeing the Christmas display & weren't willing to pay to get inside so that we could see a usually free event.",,
,,Impressive light show,5,,The indoor gardens and the light show at night are the best things to do. Try to come in the evening when it is less hot and the lights are beautiful.,,
,,mixed bag,3,,"being a tropical climate, singapore tourism have thoughfully incorporated airconditioning in almost all of its tourist attractions.so the domes are a hide out from sweltering heat. you get to appreciate some really good ,intriguing species of plant. for us it was they are the carnivorous plants like pitcher and venus fly trap. micro orchids etc.flower dome that changes its theme every few weeks is definitely attractive. I dont know whether its worth the price of the entry fee.",,
,,Amaizing,5,,This attraction is free if you don't want to take skywalk (S$8). Come at least 15 min before the start (19:45 and 20:45) if you want to sit during the show (standing is perfectly fine too). It's definitely must when you are in Singapore!,,
,,Gardens by the Bay,4,,"Would recommend this place to visit if you have a couple of spare hours, and like to walk around. The cloud dome is beautiful, well decorated and the attention to detail is breathtaking. A unique take on encouraging themes of sustainability and environmental protection. Visiting at night would be beautiful if you hace the chance.",,
,,Beautiful place,4,,Beautiful well cultivated gardens. Thoughtful informtion given to visitors. Pleasant walk. Good variety of trees and flowers,,
,,Fantastik light show,5,,"Its hard to explain what you will see in this Garden with fake trees but go there and watch the light show 7.45 pm, it鈥檚 amazing, it鈥檚 spectacular and cool. Walked around for about an hour before, sat down and waited for the show. The walk is nice even though it鈥檚 crowded, if you want to be on the bridge when the light show starts, be on time, if you want to sit down when you watch the show, be on time.
But it鈥檚 well worth the waiting.",,
,,Evening visit,5,,Nice botanical gardens but would recommend visiting in the evening when the light show is on as it adds to the experience,,
,,Loved it,5,,"Another one must see in SIngapore. The canopy is amazing. As everything in the city, perfectly planned and maintained. Great show at night with all the music and lights. The food court is worth the visit. I has bento at the Japanese place and it was delicious.Bring a lot of time with you as the whole place is really big.",,
,,Beautiful gardens & views,5,,"We really enjoyed visiting the Gardens by the Bay, particularly the Cloud Forrest. The lay out was fun with varying levels to view the gardens and Singapore and the exhibit with orchids was wonderful (smelling different scents was really cool). The flower gardens were also good but not as well laid out and a little overwhelming. Definitely a highlight of Singapore.",,
,,Stunning,5,,Worth a visit absolutely beautiful but make sure you leave plenty of time to look around there is a lot to see.,,
,,Spectacular!!,5,,"First saw the supertrees on Planet Earth, since then I have always wanted to visit. This place did not disappoint, beautiful through the day even more spectacular at night! The light show was phenomenal! Would recommend anyone going for sunset!",,
,,Unique,5,,"Excellent and Unique attraction. Very extensive and large collection. Could visit only The African section , partially in half an hour .The air conditioning and controlled environment is to be experienced very large variety of plants and Orchids",,
,,Unique,5,,"Excellent and Unique attraction. Very extensive and large collection. Could visit only The African section , partially in half an hour .The air conditioning and controlled environment is to be experienced very large variety of plants and Orchids",,
,,A unique place,5,,"A wonderful unique flora. A unique place for individual, family and group recreation. This place is a symbol of nature's respect for nature in a very urbanized agglomeration. It confirms the artistry of artistic creation of man with the use of nature to show the direct dependence of man on nature and the beauty of coexistence.",,
,,Vacation Trip,5,,"A must see place if you go to Singapore. Although not as big as I had expected And sadly some exhibitions were closed, the displays are excellent and the views from the walk way are very good.",,
,,A Great Day at Gardens by the Bay,5,,"We arrived at Gardens by the Bay at 8am. In the morning we wandered round the various gardens and we were disappointed to find that the kids area had a 鈥渃losed for maintenance all day鈥?sign. The paths were nicely paved, necessary for our pram. There was though, a surprising amount of litter and no rubbish bins. We had lunch at Satay by the Bay which was delicious. after lunch we headed to the domes, on the way finding that the children鈥檚 play area was open. We spent a few happy hours there, before going to the domes. They were both really interesting, especially the Cloud Mountain. That was a great day!

On another day we went to the light show. It was 15 minutes long and so cool! definitely worth going.",,
,,A must place in Singapur,5,,This is one of the places you must go in Singapur... but do it around 18:00 by that time it鈥檚 not to hot and you will Enjoy the walk around and the lights show,,
,,Nice place for time out,3,,This is a really nice place to stroll and sit in gardens. You can choose to spend money and look into the dome an other attractions or just wander by the river and admire the giant tree structures.,,
,,Local coming here after work,5,,"Great place to chill, enjoy the musical/light show at night and get some exercise. Spent about 3 hours here, mainly wanted to visit the Serene garden (Japanese themed) and watch the musical at night which plays near the supertrees at 7.45pm or 8.45pm. Its all free of course unless you want to climb up the supertree bridge or visit the flower domes. If you want less touristy areas I would suggest you venture away from the supertrees into the smaller gardens which are shown in the map.",,
,,Stunning.,4,,"This is a beautiful garden & wonderful nightly show, but save your money & walk around the Marina Bay sands Hotel, go up to the Lavo bar for either dinner or just cocktails like we did, see the stunning city views & sunset, then wander down around the gardens yourself! Free!",,
,,Spectacular Laser Show,5,,A must do in Singapore. Lights and laser show brilliantly played with classical music. Secure your seats early to get best glimpse of the show. And your camera tripod also! Bring your coffee tumblers. Best thing to spend your afternoon during the day. I dont know if it rains since it is an outdoor show. Your kids will love this.,,
,,A great experience,5,,A beautiful attration. Extremely well maintained gardens with lights inter woven to create a fantastic lighting show.,,
,,Not cultural but pretty,3,,"Gardens By the Bay are very famous, however it's like a themepark. I get why it's iconic for Singapore but be sure to be there before or after the big Chinese groups.

We went at 12am because the park closes at 3am so you can walk around freely all by yourself! You can't visit the other things because they close at 9pm but I doubt it's worth the money. Unless you like big groups of Chinese people.",,
,,A must-visit attraction!,5,,"This attraction is definitely worth a visit! It is by far one of the most beautiful public gardens we have seen in the city. The outdoor area had the super-trees, small lakes and bridges. We also visit the Flower Dome & Cloud Forest, which is amazing and took us about 4 hours to tour the entire place. A rain or shine activity spot, and value for money.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay,4,,There are two domes - Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. Cloud forest is spectacular with towering waterfalls inside. Flower dome is small but it is good too.,,
,,Amazing,5,,Beautiful Gardens especially in the evening with all the lights You would almost think you are on another planet,,
,,Dull,2,,All the photos online make it look very vibrant and exciting however in reality there's just a lot of green and the entire place is full of people taking selfies making it hardwork to walk around,,
,,Wonderful way to kill four hours between flights,5,,"Caught taxi from airport which took 30 minutes and cost Singapore $20 each way including tip. Plenty of information advisers on site and maps. I took 20 minute introductory shuttle tour in English at Singapore $8 and then walked to those areas of most interest. The Skyway (elevated walkway connecting some Supertrees) cost Singapore $8 and gave a wonderful overview of the site. Apart from the Supertrees, the World of Plants was a hit as plants were cut into the shape of animals (topiary) representing their part of the world. The waterways were very cooling. A whiz around could be achieved in one-and-a-half hours but I took two-and-a-half at moderate pace.",,
,,Visit with reluctant teenage sons!,5,,"This was one of my main reasons for visiting Singapore, so despite the heat and humidity I was determined to visit with my family. After much huffing and complaining from my youngest son, we made our way to the Gardens. It was well worth it....beautiful gardens, not too crowded to walk around and even better were the Cloud Forest and Flower Domes.....",,
,,Amazing gardens,5,,We enjoyed our visit we had to return for a second visit. There is so many different varieties of plants throughout these amazing gardens. The Flower Dome & Cloud forest are both well worth the admission price. Make sure return in the evening to see the sound & light show with the Super Trees,,
,,The cloud dome is so good!,4,,"We got to take lots of pictures, the waterfall is beautiful, and walking on the bridge is an amazing experience. the Light show is a must see esp when you are lying down.",,
,,The Gardens by the Bay definitely an amazing place in the world.,4,,"The Gardens by the Bay definitely an amazing place in the world. The tickets include super Tree grove, flower dome and cloud forest admission. Definitely will come back!",,
,,Just spectacular,5,,We LOVED gardens by the bay. There鈥檚 so much to see and it is all just beautiful. We purchased the tickets to go into the flower dome and the cold Forrest and we was not disappointed!! We went during the day and also came back late at night to watch the light show. The light show theme was disco which was perfect for us. We really enjoyed ourselves and spent the best part of the day here. A must do if you鈥檙e in Singapore.,,
,,Awesome park,5,,It includes 3 waterfront gardens. Flower some is a must watch there.This garden provides mesmerizing waterfront views,,
,,Nice place for a quick arop,3,,Was expecting a bit more from this but overall a nice place to visit during the evening when the lights turn on. Light show is a bit lame to be honest,,
,,"Excellent, worthwhile attraction",5,,"Stunning gardens. Great for kids and adults alike! Spectacular scenery, plants and species I have never seen before!",,
,,Magical experience,5,,Just absolutely magical! It is lovely during the day and magical at night. Spacious for children to run around and explore.,,
,,Aussie roo,5,,A wonderful experience to watch the night time light display. The gardens a great walk to enjoy even with the heat and humidity.,,
,,Beautiful place and even more beautiful in the night,5,,"Lots of things to see and it was really beautiful place. Light in the night made it even more beautiful and if possible, visit it when you can see it by day and night",,
,,The light show is fantastic!,5,,Make sure you visit at night for the light show. This was our favorite attraction in Singapore. We were lucky to find seats and the show was free.,,
,,Definitely unforgettable......,5,,A beautiful overview of Singapour in the future .. A place to visit imperatively during a travel to Singapour among others ... China town / Arab street ....,,
,,"Beautiful, definitely worth the visit!",5,,"Went this afternoon/evening. Entry to the gardens is free. You pay only for the 2 domes entry - $28 per ticket each person, so my wife and paid $56 for both of us to the domes. Entry to the skywalk is $8 each and you need to book times ie 6-7pm or 7-8pm etc.
the light show is on at 7.45 and 8.45pm each night and is packed so get there 30 minutes early for a spot!
The gardens are huge so allow plenty of time if you want to see most of it.",,
,,Magnificent,5,,"A must visit place. Spectacular sight. What not miss is the raphsody show, it's popular. And it's free unless you want to see it from the high bridges.",,
,,Day n Night Experience,5,,A must do trip when in Singapore to experience the 'Domes' and you HAVE to stay for the night time light show!,,
,,Beautiful displays,5,,"Well worth a visit as the sights are beautiful. Main garden walks are free and stunning both during the day and night. At around 8pm there is a light show to music at the Supertree Grove.
Food and drink facilities also available.
Buy a combined ticket to save money if you wish to do the flower dome, cloud dome and skyway walk.",,
,,Great day out,5,,Great day out seeing all the different tropical plants in the dunes finishing off with the light show - a truly spectacular day out,,
,,Annie Maillard,5,,"Do not miss this it is fantastic, we went twice, once to watch the light show then in the daylight to appreciate the views from the walk way and the stunning flowers, both times 10/10.",,
,,Must see attraction,5,,Even if you鈥檙e not into flowers and gardens this is a must see event. It has an exceptional wow factor about with the garden arrangements and garden settings. You鈥檒l be amazed as to how it all come together to form one beautiful spectacular attraction.,,
,,Gardens by the Bay,4,,A must in your bucket list of things to do here in Singapore. You will be amazed by these indoor gardens.,,
,,Very convenient,4,,You can directly scan the tickets at entrance and go in flower dome / cloud dome. Walked about 4 hours for the entire place. Its very crowdy and everyone wants a good pic and good spot so try to come during non peak hours.,,
,,Stunning. Well worth it.,5,,"Loved our couple of hours here - would come back and spend a little longer, as we were on a tour so had to move quickly through all exhibits.",,
,,Absolutely a must for your visit,4,,The gardens are just great but the two domes are a must! I have never seen such a place to display plant life in such an amazing way. The way the walks are arranged and the subtle inclusion of sculptures with the gardens is just fantastic. Do not miss the opportunity to go here.,,
,,"""SPECTACULAR""",5,,"A must see, a place to be! Never before such an awesome secret gardens as beautiful as this. Loving every moment of the sounds and thousand of beautiful species almost come alive....Singapore you done it again!",,
,,A must see when in Singapore,5,,We just love Singapore And Gardens by the Bay definitely makes the love bigger Very nice place to visit for families and any other travelers Many things to see and the cloud forest was our favorite together with the evening light and music show,,
,,Great place and enjoyable,5,,"Good place for taking the kids to experience and learn about different plants and flowers. We were worried about the heat and sun, but all are temperature controlled. Very enjoyable place if you like various plants and flowers. Only one small comment, too many tourists, try to avoid peak season so you will be more relax and enjoyable.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"A great place to spend an afternoon. You can wander around the gardens or pay to go in the domes. Plenty of food and drink stops around the park.
Bayfront MRT stop is just outside.

Make sure you visit Marina Bay Sands whilst in the area.",,
,,Singapore visit,5,,The two days I spent in Singapore were totally worth it! Gardens by the Bay is a unique experience. Lying on the ground to watch the spectacle was an experience I will treasure.,,
,,"Beautiful gardens, a must visit when in Singapore",5,,"We have been to Gardens by the Bay twice now. It is a beautiful garden, lots of walking to be done. It was lovely to see so many visitors there. Even the locals enjoy going there for a walk or jog. If you haven鈥檛 been there before, make sure you go just before dusk, go for a walk around all the different parts of the garden and relax and watch the sun goes down and the light show begins. Fabulous place to visit. You can also see Marina Bay Hotel in the background lit up at night.",,
,,Love love love this place,5,,Like no place on earth. Stunning gardens and structures. Fab views of the surrounding area. Great at dusk when the lights come on. Well worth a visit.,,
,,"Some love it, some don鈥檛",3,,"We enjoyed the desert cactus and orchid scent sections. The rest is rather artificial and busy. The nearby 鈥榮atay by the bay鈥?food court is a good place to get a meal afterwards, although the satay is not the best in Singapore.",,
,,A must do attraction,5,,"We purchased tickets the day before our visit at the tourist information centre in Chinatown. They were at a slightly reduced rate of $5 off each person and open dated. This meant we did not have to queue at the ticket office. We decided to visit earlier in the day and arrived around 10.30am. The domes were not crowded. To our surprise we really enjoyed looking at the beautiful flowers in the flower dome, especially the orchids. The cloud forest was spectacular and clever the way it lead you around the main structure. The environment message was sombering and we wondered about the environmental impact of the domes themselves, we were glad that to finish off our visit we joined the 20 minute ride on tour which explained the function of the super trees and other measures taken to reduce the environmental impact of the attraction.
Our tip, lookout to the shoreline from the cloud dome and see if you can spot the otters!, was a surprise.",,
,,Disappointing,2,,"I thought the Cloud Dome and Flower Dome were really disappointing. Very underwhelming, fake and lame. The 'mist show' in the cloud dome was very lame. The tree-like structures were nice though, and the music - light show was quite good fun. But I was really expecting so much more, overall. But plenty of people seem to love it, so what do I know!",,
,,Spectacular,5,,"We went along to Gardens by the Bay as we had read some reviews, and we were not disappointed. You need to go along during daylight hours to start your visit look around the domes and the trees. Then you need to wait until dusk when the domes light up and time it so you get a spot by the trees ready for the light show outside.

Best views of the light show is led down on the floor or wooden benching if you can find a spot. It is very popular. The light show lasts about 12 to 15 mins. and is synchronised to music.

Once the light show finishes you will find a great many people leaving the park, that is fine there are signs fot different exits. The problem is when you get out there are huge queues for taxi's. The taxis tend to get caught up in traffic leaving and traffic arriving.

We were told that it was nothing to wait up to an hour for a taxi. There are private taxi's and hire cars available, you will find people asking if you would like to beat the queues, but that comes at a price. We were not prepared to wait around as we had been on the go all day and just wanted to return to the hotel for a drink. The cost of the private hire was approximately 4 times the normal taxi fare (always ask the exact cost they are going to charge you before getting in).

It can be worth the extra if you are really tired. We shared the taxi with a couple who were staying at our hotel and that worked out about $11 sgd each Not really too bad, but for a single traveller it would be very expensive.

Never the less Gardens by the Bay are well worth a visit.",,
,,Too many queues,3,,"Most of the day visit was standing in various queues for the Cloud Dome and sky walk. You queue for tickets, then queue again to enter. The lights at night are fabulous though, so I suggest you go then but ticket sales stop at 8pm",,
,,You need a lot of time and be prepared to walk a long way in the heat!,5,,"We arrived for our second visit to the Gardens by the Bay onboard the Singapore Airlines Hop on, Hop off bus. The bus stops adjacent to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. From there, it was a long and tiring walk in hot and humid conditions to the central part of the gardens where the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest are located.
You do have the option on paying for rides on open people movers but in our humble opinion, if you do this, you may miss much of what there is to be seen.
On the day of our visit, the Supertree Grove & Skyway were closed for maintenance. This would have been a major disappointment for those who had specifically come to visit those attractions. It really was not much of a disappointment for us because there was just so much more to be seen and our time was limited.
After visiting the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest it was time for us to make our way back to the Marina Sands Hotel to reboard the Hop on. Hop off bus. Along the way, we paused briefly to visit some of the specialist small garden displays such as the Japanese Gardens.
By the time that we arrived back at the bust stop we were very hot and exhausted. However, we were happy that we had taken the time to make a return visit to these marvellous gardens!",,
,,Love the lights of the field.,4,,Also tried the Satay at the Satay the Bay. We love also the shuttle going to Gardens by the Bay. Flower Dome and Cloudforest are awesome want to take more pictures again.,,
,,So cool.,4,,"Discover many new variety of flowers in the dome, water falls in the cloud forest is a must watch. weekend it's crowed, better to plan on a week day. don't miss the light show in the evening after 8 PM.",,
,,The flower dome and could forest are both mesmerizing!,4,,The flower dome and could forest are both mesmerizing! You can go here if you want to see a garden in the city. Everything is amazing.,,
,,Had an amazing day at the gardens.,4,,This ticket comes with the flower dome and the cloud forest which were spectacular. See some beautiful flowers and the highest indoor waterfall. It鈥檚 great to cool off in these places and beat the heat as well.,,
,,Spectacular,4,,I have been to Singapore many times but never fails to amaze me how spectacular the Supertree Grove and Skywalk is.Such a gorgeous and calming experience!,,
,,Great experience especially if it is your first.,4,,There are two separate areas: one specializing in flowers and the other has a waterfall. It is quite busy on the weekends during early evening times so avoid that you if can.,,
,,Wonderful Gardens,5,,"We visited the gardens on a Saturday and it wasn鈥檛 overly crowded. The MRT brought us very close to the entrance. The super trees were interesting and we paid the $8 to do the tree top walk. The views were great.
After that we went to the cloud forest and flower dome. I can not recommend the cloud forest enough. It was incredible. The flower dome was okay, so if you can only do one I would suggest the cloud forest. Both domes are air conditioned which was a nice reprieve from the heat.",,
,,Garden,5,,Awesome good to have a walk arround the viewing platform attached to the concrete trees is a must gives you a great view,,
,,High trees,5,,"What a nice place, Gardens by the bay will be historical monument in the future, the high trees with a wonderful decoration .",,
,,A beautiful place to visit,4,,I have been to Singapore many times but never to the gardens! The sky walk is a great experience although we had to wait to go up due to a few spots of rain! This is best viewed late afternoon when not so hot and then can have dinner in satay by the bay and back to see the light show at 7.45 or 8.45pm at the trees! Can also view this from the link from marina bay sands! The children鈥檚 garden has a splash pad but it鈥檚 closed on Mondays for maintainance! The inside flower dome was ok but not so interesting for kids.,,
,,Where do they get the money ?,5,,An astonishing place ! It never fails to amaze me how much Singapore spends on its infrastructure and this is no exception. The Supertree Grove and Skywalk is spectacular.,,
,,Loved it!,5,,"Such a gorgeous and calming experience. Flowers at their most pristine. The kids really enjoyed themselves, and we particularly liked the movie at the end. It was very funny!!",,
,,Lovely place to visit with the family,5,,"We came here with friends and family to check this out and was very impressed. We took the scenic route there, walking through The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands. If you walk all the way to the end you can get up to the top floor and walk along the outdoor terrace on the roof and get a really good view of the Marina Bay Sands hotel.

From here, you can walk across to the hotel and through it to get to the Gardens by the Bay on the other side. We were lucky enough to get complimentary entry to the Domes and the Skyway, but I think I would have happily paid to enter them. It should be noted that there's still a lot to see even without paying to enter either of these attractions and the light shows at 19:45 and 20:45 are free.

We were a little short on time and as we went during the day, we whizzed past the outdoor gardens. What we did see of them was very nice, but during the day the heat is pretty oppressive.

We checked out the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome and whilst both were impressive, the Cloud Forest is really cool. First thing you see is a huge waterfall. The air conditioning and spray from the waterfall will be a welcome relief if you've been outside in the heat for a while. The scale of both domes is really impressive and even if you only have a passing interest in anything horticultural, you can't help but be impressed with what's on display. You'll probably end up learning quite a lot from the information provided too. Note, it can get quite crowded in the Cloud Forest especially around the main photo taking points, although we were ok pushing a buggy around.

After whizzing around both domes, we went up into the Skyway. If you're not good at heights, be warned that the Skyway can be a little daunting. However, if you can make it at all, I would recommend it. Views are great from it and it provides a different perspective. It's relatively short and you're supposed to spend up to 15 minutes up there at peak times, however, at 8 SGD for an adult, it isn't the most expensive attraction in the world. It gets very busy at night particularly around the times of the light show and you have to get a time slot. We went around 6 pm and there was practically no queue. At 20:00 it was a different story and there was a substantial queue.

We then went to have dinner at the Supertree Foodhall, which has a selection of outlets from HK roast meats to Japanese to fried chicken. The added benefit of going here for food is that you're very close to the Supertrees to watch the light show. If you fancy bringing your own food, there are plenty of places to sit and eat outdoors.

The Mesmerising Garden Rhapsody Show, or the light show, is about 15 minutes long and is basically lights mounted on the Supertrees coordinated to music. That makes it sound very basic, but it is actually quite nice to watch. If you can, get amongst the trees and the place is generally clean enough for you to lie on the floor and look up at the trees. My kids were mesmerised enough to actually lie still the whole time. Bring some mozzie spray as there is a small risk of being bitten at night. MRT stations can get very busy in the evening, and we walked to a further MRT station, Bayfront, which brings you around the Marina Sands complex.

All in all, well worth a visit or two and you can easily spend the whole day here.",,
,,Gardens meet Modern Architecture!,5,,"There is so much to see that it seems to blur in the memory! We had allocated one day to the Gardens by the Bay and we decided to buy the combined tickets for three attractions plus unlimited Shuttle Service rides (only needed those to get to the Floral Fantasy on time). It was worth it! We could not visit all 101 hectares - but we had a good go!

The Cloud Forest dome contains the world's tallest indoor waterfall (30 metres) so you go up in a lift and walk down on a pathway that goes out into the air so that you can look back and get a good view.

The Flower Dome is the largest glass greenhouse in the world and gives an experience of spring everyday. As well as plants from Mediterranean and semi-arid regions, there are quirky sculptures and models to make you smile.

Floral Fantasy is the newest addition, with floral arrangements over four themes (not that we noticed). It is time-ticketed because, after you complete the quite short walk through the ""garden"" you queue to get into the 4-D theatre for a 3-D film representing the flight of a dragonfly with flight simulator (moving seat) effects, complete with fragrances and sprays of water. The kids might enjoy it, but I felt it was a bit overrated.

But beyond the indoor gardens, there are loads more outdoors with the Dragonfly and Kingfisher Lakes and surroundings (free!). To be honest, we did not have time to visit the Skyway, though you can walk under the Supertrees. We stayed on into the night to see the sound and light show (which for us involved the advertising of Toy Story 4 projected on to 2-D cloud shapes between the Supertrees), as well as the Supertrees changing colours.

All in all, a very full afternoon and evening! Highly recommended! It is amazing that Singapore has managed to make a success out of these very modern gardens as well as the more traditional Botanic Garden - don't miss either!",,
,,A Must-See!,5,,"Yeah, it's just a garden, and you've seen hundreds before. But this one's very much worth seeing!

Bring your walking shoes, and be prepared for lots of people! Gardens by the Bay is much bigger than it looks, so you'll be doing a lot of walking. It is, however, air conditioned in the covered areas, so at least you'll have a break from the heat.

You absolutely have to stay for the light show, but plan on leaving a few minutes early--there are so many people and getting out of there is insane.",,
,,Fascinating place to visit,5,,"A beautiful place to visit, have a picnic lunch or spend the evening watching the unusual light show.",,
,,Beautiful day (and evening out!),5,,We did two visits here. A day visit with all the extras e.g. floral fantasy and the skywalk etc. We then did a night visit for the light show. I would recommend both.,,
,,Gorgeous,5,,"Absolutely a must see whilst visiting Singapore. A wonderful display of creativity and collaboration of colours of different shapes, textures from all over the world. An enjoyable experience.",,
,,The best thing we ever experienced as a couple,5,,"This is a MUST do not leave singapore without catching the light shows that start at 7.45 so get a good spot early. You need to get a slot time and already have a ticket if you want to be on the skywalk this isnt advertised anywhere. Get a slot 30 mins before the light show is due to start. We went twice and weekends have 3 times tye amount of people. Also heads up you dont need a ticket to see the show or walk around the gardens. Just for the sky walk and domes. If your not a fan of plants dont waste your time with the domes. If you appreciate nature or want pictures next to flowers then its a must. But its very similar to the botanical gardens. We didnt do the lost world as the wait was 1 hr to see some plants ?

We have great 4k & 360掳 footage of this on our channel seewhatwesee 360 .. and great pics and tips on how and where to get the best pics on our IG page seewhatwesee_",,
,,Best view,5,,Entering Gardens by the Bay was easy using the printed pass. Visiting this spot is highly recommended for people who are nature lovers. The waterfall inside was very fascinating!,,
,,Just loves it,5,,We have a wonderful experience during our visit here. Expect to spend 4-5 hours walking through the park and 2 domes. Bring a mat or towel to spread on the grass to enjoy the light show at 8pm. It is absolutely beautiful.,,
,,The two dombs were amazing.,4,,"The two dombs were amazing. I went with my parents and they were awstruk, seeing the vast structures with so many plants and trees. This is a must do activity for sure.",,
,,Another gem in this wonderful city,5,,"I have always admired it from afar each time I visited the Marina Bay area.
I am captivated once I decided to visit this beautiful and technologically advanced garden featuring quite a comprehensive selection of garden varieties in a comfortable yet exciting environment.
If you think you do not like flowers or plants, or you have been discouraged by friends against admiring a garden at the very least, do yourself a favour. Give this place a chance and you will not regret it.",,
,,One of the nicest attractions I've ever visited,5,,I can't recommend Gardens by the Bay enough. The domes are absolutely beautiful and a peaceful way to spend an afternoon. The light show is magnificent and reminds me of the most elaborate US Christmas displays.,,
,,"If you're a fan of flowers and nature, this is the place to be.",4,,The place is full of various kinds of flowers from all over the world. Just make sure to have someone take your picture with you for all the beautiful backgrounds you can use. And don't forget to bring a jacket because of the cold temperature inside.,,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,"Huge span area. Great for stroll, jogging and cycling to enjoy the greenery view, fresh air and stay fit and healthy. Cloud Forest , Dome and Marina Bay Sands are within the locality. Not to be missed!",,
,,Spectacular!,5,,"The gardens are beautiful and a must see when in Singapore. Getting to the gardens is easy and walking around them is a day trip in itself. So much to see and do. Busy but not crowded as there is so much space and areas to visit.

Any of the viewing areas, the flower dome, the sky walk etc are at a cost which you can approeciate in terms of the upkeep of such a beautiful spot.

We did the skywalk between the trees which was $8 each and the view was well worth it. Amazing!

There is so much to see. We did a return visit at night to see the lights as well. This is a must see.",,
,,An absolute must see,5,,"We are really not in to plants but the Gardens by the Bay were a great day out. Our tickets included the Skyway and the two domes.
We all loved it, it was just a shame so many people stopped every all over the domes to take selfies/pictures this made navigating the domes a real pain at times, but it is very worth that pain",,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,A one of a kind nature park... gardens conservatory developed on reclaimed land.. with flowers and plants from almost all over the world.. million species.. a man made waterfall.. lush green vegetation and what not.. so very well preserved .. feels heaven on earth.. A must visit...star attraction of Singapore...,,
,,Must see in Singapore,5,,"Impressive park , architectural masterpiece, must see attraction in Singapore. Flower Dome, Cloud Forest , Supertree Grove and its skywalk are , among others , attractions that worth be seen.... A lot of sculptures and free light shows in the evening. unforgettable!",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"We loved it here and recommend it, beautifully done & maintained. The engineering is amazing. The floral fantasy ($72 for 2, includes unlimited shuttle transfers) was stunning and a work of art. We shuttled everywhere & this is so worth doing as gardens are huge & being Singapore it is hot & humid. Sadly the flower dome was closed for maintaince on our visit. The cloud forest walk is free & has a very good treetops walk.",,
,,"""Amazing,Fabulous,Enchanting""",4,,"We visited Gardens by the bay in June,during the rose festival.I have to say this is really an amazing place that they have created in a dome and fully air-conditioned.Its almost like a mystical garden and there were a wide array of roses of all colours and species.

One can spend a great deal of time among the flowers and you can take endless selfies.There are also cactus,baobab tree etc etc.The forest has a huge waterfall which gushes down and also a small orchid garden that has fragarant orchids.

An exciting place to visit,don't miss it.",,
,,Must Visit Attraction,5,,Wonderful modern gardens. At night the lighting is beautiful. Still worth wandering through (free access) if you don鈥檛 want to pay for some of the options.,,
,,Don't Go Hungry!,1,,"We were picked up from our hotel at 8.15am by the transfer bus, so we hadn't had time to get breakfast. I rang to enquire if we could get the tickets and go later (with Buffalo Tours) but they said no. I asked if there were breakfast options at Gardens By The Bay - he said ""You'll never go hungry in Singapore.""

However - we did! There were about 10 listed dining options in the brochure. We spent an hour to an hour and a half trying to located each and every one of these ""dining options"" with very unsuccessful results. Every single place at 9.30/10am was closed, all except McDonald's (which I've never been to in my life and won't start now!) and a cafe next door to it which looks like it belongs in a third world country!

So we left to go and have breakfast elsewhere and never saw Gardens By The Bay, except while looking for the food options.

All the staff were EXTREMELY unhelpful and gave us incorrect information and directions. We were constantly told to go different way to exit - one person said to go upstairs, which we did, but the man upstairs told us to go downstairs.

It was a really frustrating and horrible experience, so we did not bother to go back during the day to use our pre-bought wasted tickets.",,
,,Disappointing,3,,"We visited here with our family on our last day in Singapore. Given time constraints due to flights we thought a Cloud Forest experience would be best.
On arrival at the ticket office we were told we had to buy a combined Cloud Forest and Flower Dome ticket despite explaining we did not have time to visit both.
The queue to enter the Forest was not too bad, although maintaining any form of personal space was almost impossible! Our first view of the Forest was lovely but this is also where things started to go downhill.
We were herded into lifts to reach the top floor which was challenging if you are at all claustrophobic. On reaching the top floor there were large numbers of people and it was difficult to see anything without being bumped or pushed. Any hope of finding a quiet spot to take in the surroundings was impossible. Floating walkways take you down each level where you can view the many differing plants and also views of Singapore. The walkway may be difficult if you have a fear of heights.
On one level there is an educational section with film show explaining mans鈥?global impact but most people just walked through without stopping. A real educational opportunity missed!!
Really the sheer numbers going through the forest at one time completely spoiled the experience for our party of 7. Collectively we agreed we would have had a more enjoyable experience just walking through the gardens and enjoying the evening light show which we just caught the end of.
Surprisingly, the toilets near the ticket desk at the Cloud Forest were not very clean.",,
,,Just stunning!,5,,The gardens were just beautiful. Most definitely a must do when visiting Singapore. I would love to go back and do it all again as I ran out of time. The new addition with the 4D experience is fun!,,
,,Visited the Floral Fantasy,5,,"My wife and i enjoyed our short but enjoyable visit to the new attraction, Floral Fantasy. We saw some rather unique and beautiful flowers all creatively arranged and curated.

The 4-D show at the end was a pleasant teaser of the entire garden, and would be useful for those who do not have the time (or stamina) to walk the entire garden.",,
,,Cool attraction,4,,"Gardens by the Bay is definitely Singapore on a plate (although note that the excellent Satay by the Bay is about as far away from the main attractions as it is possible to be - which is more than fine for a walk, but just be ready if you want an immediate hawker experience). Of the two domes, if you only have one to see, it is the cloud dome. The flower dome is beautiful, but has an element of complete random placement of flowers which is a bit off-putting. We didn't make it in time to go up onto the platform - but it really isn't essential - the view of the lightshow can be seen from many many places. And that is worth it, whether you are up or down.",,
,,Gorgeous Blooms,5,,Loved the riot of colours of all the flowers and amazed at the trees and lush growth in the two Domes. Certainly a lovely place to visit.,,
,,Beautiful but very crowded,5,,"The gardens and the pathways were all very beautiful. Nice scenery and designs in every corner. We tried to avoid going in the weekends, we went midweek. However, it was still overly crowded. Also the restaurants available are a bit limited. None the less it's a must visit.",,
,,A beautiful day,5,,"I visited the gardens for half a day. I got my ticket online and saved time at the entrance.
There are many things to do even if you go alone. All the gardens have someting interesting or beautiful to see. There are collections of tropical flowers, cactus, shrubs, big trees, orchards and more all beautifully arranged.
There are some areas focused on environmental protection and renewable energy that are well presented.
The hanging gardens are also great. They created a microclimate that allow to grow a large variety of plants, flowers, ferns, shrubs, moss, and lots more; all of them makes a fantastic place.
There are good places to get food at reasonable prices.
I took a taxi to get there it was not expensive.
Good visit in all",,
,,Really relaxed and enjoyable,5,,"My wife and I spent he best part of 5 hours at the Gardens and would highly recommend a visit to the conservatories, especially the cloud forest. I can see how some may find it a bit boring just wandering around the Gardens without going in the special exhibits, but if you were a local it's be a lovely place to go and have a picnic as there is a really relaxed atmosphere.",,
,,Plan the day and enjoy the experience,5,,"If you're visiting this place for the first time then plan your trip, especially if you're with small kids. Don't forget to check the weather forecast. This is indeed an experience of a lifetime. Loads of opportunities for good photographs too. You'd need 3 to 6 hours to enjoy this place.",,
,,Touristy...,3,,It's a okay place to spend a couple of hours and let the kids run free. But it felt too touristy and gimmicky to me. The displays weren't exactly out-of-the-world. And most of the garden looks manufactured anyway.,,
,,A MUST for EVERY visitor,5,,I will always bring my visitors to GBB .. always a great outing and something to do in the late afternoon on a hot Singapore afternoon. JUST go and BE SURPRISED.,,
,,Must be seen,4,,"To be honest, you will need at least 2 days to explore Garden by the Bay for those whom are interested in Flowers,plants etc.

1 Day will be needed just to walk through both domes and experience why this place is iconic.

2nd Day will be needed to explore the outer parks surrounding the domes. It will be a great place to have a picnic

Make sure that you're there till evening to enjoy the great view of the Super Trees and enjoy the skyline of Marina Bay.

To any travellers coming to Singapore for the 1st time, please make this a pit stop after visiting Merlion Park.

Note : Be prepared to be able to walk for hours, so family travelling with old folks or children to plan ahead well.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"Beautiful,the decorations of flowers are amazing.FEel so mesmirsed and being brought to another world with all the flowers in floral fantasy.Location is conveneient.",,
,,Beautiful park and well kept plants,5,,"It is one of the most visited place in Singapore by tourists. I have been there a couple of times in the past and enjoyed it every time .

Good BBQ food at Satay by the bay which is about 7 mins walk from the garden. Light show started at 7:45pm on July. Lots of people sat down on the grass area to enjoy the about 7mins colorful light and music synchronization on the tree grow.

Lots of thing to see there. You can take a casual walk around the well kept park and see a variety of plants

Short walk to the Marina sands hotel you can purchase ticket to the observation deck.

Love to come back again.",,
,,Don鈥檛 miss this place!,5,,"Amazing. Incredible. Wow. There aren鈥檛 enough words to describe Gardens by the Bay. My teenage boys loved it. My husband loved it - and they don鈥檛 even like gardening! Every turn revealed another little secret. The sculptures & displays ranged from cute to stunning. We were also thrilled to find that the domes were cool - we had expected them to be like giant greenhouses. The view from the skywalk shouldn鈥檛 be missed, even if you鈥檙e afraid of heights. Although be warned, the bridge might wobble slightly if you get someone trying rush from one end to the other.",,
,,Huge space to run,5,,Great place for family outing!! Lots of space to walk and run!! Could spend literally half a day here just to laze around !! Spend my morning doing photography!,,
,,Must be seen,5,,"During the day, it is OK there, but it is much better to see the gardens in the evening and watch the light show. This is a great adventure.",,
,,Beautiful,4,,"An amazing place by day or night. The nightly light show is stunning and the general gardens a nice place to stroll around in the day. The only thing is all of the attractions within, you have to pay for (& there are quite a few things so it adds up quickly as they're not particularly cheap)",,
,,A must for plant lovers,4,,"Home to a beautiful array of plants housed both in the grounds and within the green houses, the cloud forest is stunning to look at with its large indoor waterfall. There is also a children鈥檚 outdoor water playground which is a welcome oasis when the weather is particularly hot and humid. It鈥檚 free to wander around but you have to pay to go into the glass houses. The new flower festival if reminiscent of the London flower shows.",,
,,Big Ol' naked baby,5,,"Of course there isn't just one naked baby, but it was the thing that stood out in my mind. I loved to light show - saw it twice - and the overall feel of the place. Would recommend as a must to anyone that is visiting Singapore.",,
,,Loved the greenhouses and the tree top walk,4,,"Both the greenhouses as well as the 'trees' are interesting architectural structures. It's nice not only to walk within the garden, but also to have a look down from the top side. Certainly the rainforest greenhouse with it's huge waterfall at the entrance is beautifully made. Wonderful to walk around on different heights.",,
,,Absolute Must Visit - Beautiful and Unique,5,,"This is an absolute must visit in Singapore. It is very unique and a breath-taking experience (even for non-nature lovers). I would suggest starting at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel lobby, and walking through to the Gardens, it is a bit of a walk (maybe 20 minutes) but it鈥檚 a really nice walk and clearly signposted. It is free to visit the garden (but e.g. the Domes and Skyway require entry fees). The Gardens are so beautiful, clean and pristine and not a flower out of place. You also get an excellent view of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel in its entirety. The Tree Grove is probably around the middle of the Gardens and you can buy tickets to walk on the Skyway (which I recommend too, you get an elevated view of the Gardens and the Hotel). Afterwards, you can take a stroll to the Domes (also a must visit, particularly the Cloud Forest). If you arrive mid afternoon you will get the view during the day and stay until around sunset to get the sunset views too. Don鈥檛 leave Singapore without visiting.",,
,,Wonderful and cool,5,,We visited on a very hot day. Having walked from the bay we were very happy to discover the domes are cooled. Both were well worth the visit and enjoyed by the whole family. We started with Cloud forest which we enjoyed slightly more and was worth spending a bit more time in.,,
,,Fantastic Gardens,4,,"We visited the gardens on Saturday, busy but not overly crowded
25 minute audio bus tour round the gardens gives you an overview of where things are and the choice to go back and see something
Restaurant in the tower being refurbished so was closed when we were there, but plenty of food outlets
Could easily spend a full day there with places to have your own picnic",,
,,Amazing Gardens a must visit when in Singapore.,5,,This attraction was definately worth the visit. There are acres of gardens and such an amazing variety of plants trees and flowers that uou can wonder through at no cost. But to see the amazing flower dome and cloud dome these you have to pay for. S$28. But well worth it. Also to walk on the Skyway it costs S$8. A lift takes you up one of the trees to a suspended platform that you walk around amounts the trees. They have a new attraction which is called flower fantasy for S$20 which you walk through four types of flower and plant designs and it finishes with a 4d theatre showing the bay gardens. But you can take at leadt 4 hours to do all this. Then there is the night light and music show the trees put on. There are two sessions 7.45 and 8.45 and worth going back for this as this is also a free event.,,
,,Well worth a visit,5,,Buy a ticket at the information desks in the local shopping Malls to avoid queuing to get in - plenty to see walking around the 鈥榙omes鈥?with tranquil gardens to meander around at your own pace.,,
,,Garden by the bay,5,,"Never disappointed with my visit each time I returned home. The theme was different each year I went. The beauty of the plants and greenery amazed me. I will return with visitors from uk,",,
,,Awsome,5,,Great place to wander in to the beauty of nature and get lost inside a little dome! Airco is on so its cool inside,,
,,Must do,5,,"So I have been here so many times because it鈥檚 a real gem! 鉂わ笍鉂わ笍 the daily supertrees show, the satay by the bay food and just to walk around and enjoy the greenery.",,
,,WOW!,5,,"Must visit place when in Singapore, beautiful and very impressive. We went there in late evening and walked around this beautiful park for couple of hours and also had a Dinner at a very good food court they have on premises.",,
,,Beautiful!,5,,Such wonderful gardens. it was very quiet whilst we were there which was lovely. we climbed up to view from above which is amazing. make sure you wear comfortable shoes,,
,,The colourful treat to eyes.,5,,Unbelievable experience which cant be explained until you watch with your own eyes.... The music show is at 7.45 pm is a treat to the eyes and ears.... Dont miss the episode,,
,,Must visit attraction,4,,this is one of the most popular places in Singapore and for the right reasons. You definitely need good 3-4 hours to enjoy and explore all the wonder in this place. Travel light.,,
,,Kind of over rated especially for tourists,2,,"It鈥檚 ok not a bad place only that it is kind of a rip off for tourists in the sense tourists and non residences are forced to purchased both the waterfall and flower garden and cannot purchase just the waterfall. The flower garden wasn鈥檛 that impressive and both attractions adds up and ended up a little expensive for what it鈥檚 worth . Hey said only residence can purchase just one attraction ....this started a few mi the ago . Stick it to the tourists :(
Funny thing is the airport just opened up a mall at the terminal with a beautiful waterfall better than the one at the garden !",,
,,Ok but not great,3,,Went here because i was told it is the thing to do. Out of the floral experience and the cloud forest i found this to be the least spectacular. Still lots of nice flowers and colours but not that spectacular.,,
,,Amazing amazing amazing!!,5,,"Go here, otherwise you will regret it!! It is simply stunning here and especially at night. I would recommend to go here both on day time and an evening stroll 鈽猴笍",,
,,Prepare to be amazed...,5,,Go during the late afternoon so you can stay until the sun sets. Wonderful displays in the Fantasy Flower exhibit with a fun 4D simulation at the end. The light shows are phenomenal as is the high walkway...if you have the head for it. Fantastic backdrops will blow you away. An absolute must even for those not terribly interested in flowers or nature. Spot lizards and birds going about their daily business... and take your time. Easy to spend a day in the area....and pop into Marina Bay Sands Hotel too.,,
,,Incomparable,5,,"After visiting the Singapore Botanic gardens these gardens should be on your top 10 list as well. The car free large area is connected with the iconic hotel and is a really visit. The garden is less unique compared to the SBG, but large lighted trees are unique. Spend a few dollars on the air bridge as it gives stunning views of the park and the Singapore skyline.",,
,,Amazing,5,,"We just did a quick visit to watch the light display along with thousands of others, whilst we only viewed from the walk over I believe we got a better view of the site.",,
,,Nice to cool down,3,,"Nice and cool inside, we liked the cloud forest best. The flower dome was less interesting for teenagers.",,
,,Cloud Foreat,5,,"So we came here like all tourist do and it certainly did not disappoint. However here鈥檚 my take on some of the exhibits. To my surprise, the grounds at gardens by the bay are admission free. Which is generous considering everywhere you walk inside the park grounds you鈥檙e struck with beautiful foliage and futuristic (Avatar like) views.

We got there just after noonish and it was nice as the crowds were minimal. Most people come later in the evening to watch the light show at the supertrees which is also free but extremely crowded. I鈥檇 advise you to get a seat under the supertrees at least an hour early for the best views.

We did however pay the admission fee to enter the Cloud forest and the flower dome. Here鈥檚 鈥渕y鈥?opinion on the two exhibits. Cloud forest is 10/10 must see. Absolutely gorgeous from every angles and that is immediately present at the waterfall entrance. The flower dome however was nice but not anything special. If you like random trees and large succulents from around the world then I鈥檇 recommend this exhibit. But take what I鈥檓 going to say next seriously! If you plan to visit both exhibits, do yourself a favor and go to the flower dome FIRST. We did the opposite and the sheer magnificence of the cloud forest made the flower dome look like someone鈥檚 nicely landscaped yard. Anywho. We stayed for the light show which was nice but again crowded. Hope this review helps.

I鈥檓 not a professional photographer. But below you鈥檒l see some photos I took with my Nikon to show you how easy it is to get a great view. Enjoy.",,
,,You will have to appreciate for what it is,3,,"The whole area is pretty and nicely done. Singapore does a lot of things to bring back more green to their environment. They did a great job bringing in all those plants along with architectural design and it won鈥檛 disappoint. However, I鈥檓 not going to over hype this place. It鈥檚 worth a visit.",,
,,Absolutely Gorgeous,5,,"This is a don't miss attraction in Singapore. The gardens are beautiful and (bonus) the whole place is air conditioned. The waterfall is amazing. However, you have to be comfortable with heights to really experience all the gardens have to offer. You need pretty much a full day to explore everything.",,
,,Amazing - don鈥檛 miss!,5,,Amazing Gardens like no other I have seen. A not to be missed attraction when you鈥檙e in Singapore. Try to wear your best clothes and dress up as you will be able to take some amazing photos here - something that I didn鈥檛 know!,,
,,Interesting but over-hyped,3,,"We found the flower dome interesting to walk through, but the masses of selfy-takers gets very irritating. The tree dome is nicer, in particular the walkway. The lightshow was ok, but not to be rated as spectacular. Andre Rieu music is better to be heard live....We went afterwards to Satay at the Bay - dissappointing, and below the standard (and offering) compared to hawker centres in the city.",,
,,Lovely,4,,"We really enjoyed ourselves at the Gardens by the Bay. We had a good 4,5 hrs there and time seemed to fly. I think you could stay even longer - especially if you arrive around 5pm and stay til dark.",,
,,A-M-A-Z-I-N-G,5,,Came here for a look and stayed and stayed and stayed! This place is an absolute gem . Loved everything there was on offer. DO NOT miss a thing. The gardens were incredible and the sculptures scattered throughout were equally as impressive. Have lunch or dinner at Satay by the Bay is was value for money. One of the best parts of a trip to Singapore.,,
,,Wow. Don't miss these gardens.,5,,"The gardens are free to enter but there is a charge if you want to go into the two domes - I highly recommend you budget for this because they were a highlight of our visit. This is a big property, lots of gardens of different types, a fish pond with the biggest and most colourful koi I have ever seen, easy walking paths (some with steps which can be avoided), interesting sculptures, shady spots and plenty of seating around the gardens. There is a small guided tour (driven) which is not free but could be a good option if you can't walk very far or it is too hot. There are children's play areas, and options for food and drink. Buses, trains and taxis all service this area. Allow plenty of time, spend the day if you can so that you can see everything.",,
,,Amazing Garden,5,,Awesome garden filled with flowers and trees. The theme during my visit was Roses so the dome is filled with garden of roses. Loves the OCBC skyway as you get to see nice view of Marina Bay Sands on top of the supertrees. Not to forget the Garden of Rhapsody on 7.45pm. Totally mesmerizing and worth of visit,,
,,Not to be missed,5,,The outer gardens are free but you pay a modest fee to enter the domes. Do yourself a big favour and pay the modest fee. Well worth the money and the visit. Go in the s=afternoon so you can stay and take in the Supertree light show in the early evening.,,
,,A must if visiting Singapore,5,,We visited the park at night first and were wowed by the light show it was amazing. We returned the following day to visit the attractions and on our last night returned to watch the light show again it was so amazing.,,
,,Wonderful,5,,"The gardens themselves (on reclaimed land) are wonderfully relaxing in themselves and are free of charge but the two domes - Flower and Cloud Forest - are paid. Tourists, if they don't have the Singapore Tourist pass, should bring their airline boarding pass for a reduction; elderly foreigners also get a reduction! The most spectacular, by day or by night, are the Avatar supertrees.",,
,,"What a fun, free experience",5,,We enjoyed the light show while lying on a grassy lawn below the 鈥渢rees鈥? Such a fabulous experience and all for free. We were short on time but if we weren鈥檛 we would have gone on the skywalk and to the domes as well (there is a cost for these). There鈥檚 lots to see without any cost though. Make sure you arrive around 720/730 to secure a great spot to view from. Easy to get there from the bay park mrt station.,,
,,No sure what the fuss is all about ?? --> Artifical tress with some lights and music ?,2,,"Lots of low end noisy Asian tourists dumped by the truck load (well... Gardens by the bay is free after all). Crazy heat / humidity (no fans / ventilation). Day time is of low interest, best time to come is for the 7.45PM ""show"". The light is good for pictures. The show is impressive for the first 30s but then the remaining 14 minutes is just same: poorly picked classical music mixed with a light show on the fake trees. If you have kids they will like it. I did not. If you are well-traveled around the world, you will have seen a lot better shows / set-ups elsewhere. It seems targeted to regional tourists who leave their country for the first time. Come for a pic and leave before everyone else rushes out. MAD taxi lines to leave the place so walk to Marina Bay Sands to increase your taxi chances. 8' walk.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"We did not go into the domes, but strolled around in the park. Beautiful and peaceful. Good to get away from the busy streets.",,
,,Amazing place must see for nature lovers,5,,A must see place for nature lovers who will love to stroll across the park and see the beautiful and lovely flowers trees and the way the garden has been built,,
,,Magical and fantastic,5,,"What can I say that hasn鈥檛 already been said about Gardens by the Bay. On a three week holiday in Asia with my wife and three teenage kids and this was one of the highlights.

Did the free light show in the evening which was absolutely magical.

Did the Gardens the following morning which were fantastic. If you get the MRT there I recommend walking through the gardens to get to the domes rather than taking the shuttle bus as you will miss some interesting stuff on the bus. The forest dome is so impressive the flower dome feels like a little underwhelming after it.",,
,,Amazing Man Made Garden,5,,"This was one of the best times we had in Singapore but it was really exhausting because there's so much to cover and you can't just skip because everything is so beautiful you want to savor everything you see.

Highly Recommended. Please do visit this and you can sometimes gets cheaper rate if you book at airport.",,
,,Garden By The Bay,5,,Amazing climate experience! The botanical gardens are great! So many species! Well worth the trip and highly recommend,,
,,Wheelchair accessible completely,5,,"For Wheelchair users, Don鈥檛 follow google maps, just take an MRT to Bayfront station and get out at the signs pointing towards Gardens of the bay, any the very entrance there is a shuttle service free of charge for wheelchair users to get to flower dome and clod forest, so have fun.",,
,,Garden of experience.,5,,We had a wonderful time! my family enjoyed the experience and the new attractions. It a very convenient place to visit for our elderly family members.,,
,,Anniversary weekend,5,,The area was massive and gorgeous. We visited the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome. Both are amazing. You can see the amount of work and love the people put in not only these two areas but in everything.,,
,,Do not miss it,5,,So many other reviewers have congratulated Singapore on these gardens so I won't waste time - go there. Don't be afraid to see other great parts besides the 2 x domes. Go back at night and see super trees lit up.,,
,,Met our expectations,5,,"We have been looking forward to visiting Gardens by The Bay for a long time鈥?in fact it was the prime reason for our trip from Australia.
All of our expectations were met and then exceeded.
It鈥檚 a must see if you have even a passing interest in gardening but you don鈥檛 have to be an expert to really appreciate the beauty on display
Highly recommended",,
,,Layover Day relaxation in the Gardens,5,,"This is how a community facility should be. Other than the Cloud and Flower Pavillions and elevated Walkway access to everything is completely free. Trains, car and pedestrian access is provided. The gardens have plenty of shade and walkways. Broken into sections the Gardens can accommodate many people but you never feel crowded. The Childrens area is especially great, safe, cool, challenging if you want but fun for all kids. There are toilets and food outlets everywhere and in the evening at 7.45 or 8.45 the free sound and light show in the super grove is amazing. Easy to see why this is the #1 attraction in Singapore. A very well earned rating!",,
,,Amazing place,5,,"Gardens by The bay is a must do if visiting Singapore. It's an amazing to wander through the domes, around the grounds and experience one of the best gardens anywhere. As you go through the domes, there's something different or wonderful to look at. This was an amazing experience.",,
,,"Excellent gardens, must visit",5,,"Excellent gardens, must visit flower dome and cloud forest dome. There is a light and sound show in the evening.",,
,,Amazing Experience,5,,"Our family loved this place. We were pleasantly surprised as many people told us to go there, but it wasn't really something we would normally do. Great for families!",,
,,Disappointing,2,,"The gardens themselves are very pretty but the light show was nothing special and the Domes so overcrowded and ""Disney-like"" that I would not recommend them for the price.The Botanical Gardens are much better.",,
,,Great place to spend the day,5,,"Gardens by the bay definitely worth a visit. Amazing gardens and sculptures as well as tree top walks. First gardens that our kids 13,11yrs were happy to spend the day. Cloud dome and flower dome highlights and cooler places to be on hot days. Plenty of places to eat. Easy to get too, would go again.",,
,,Cloud dome is awesome,5,,One of the best places to visit is the cloud forest dome. Much better then flower dome. The viee from the top of the waterfall is amazing.,,
,,Lovely,5,,A great time. We went about 6pm and went into both domes. My favourite was cloud forest. We were then in place for the light show at 7.45. Plenty of space and even a shuttle bus if you want a lift to the entrance to escape the heat for 2 dollars. Lots of garden so you could spend plenty of time there and it's free if you don't go in the domes. Definitely on your to do list,,
,,Great value for money,5,,"Arrive about lunchtime and do the outside gardens first and Skywalk,then do inside the Domes. The Waterfall and the Flower gardens are terrific they have lifts to the top of the dome and easy walkways spiral around down and you can take your time in their. Be outside for the Lazer Light Show the kids will love it. It's at about 8PM.It is 5minute walk to the MRT Station or taxi's,it has a large car park if driving.",,
,,Best late afternoon to evening,4,,"A must see when visiting Singapore. Free to visit, but the flower dome, skywalk and cloud forest all cost. You can get the deals on Klook or other discount places. The flower dome is very well done, featuring flowers and plants from many Mediterranean countries. The theme when we were there in June was roses, so the whole dome smelt Devine. Can be very crowded and easy to miss some of the displays with all the crowds. The waterfalls in The cloud forest were spectacular and definitely worthwhile to spend the money to see them. Both the flower dome And cloud forest are air conditioned. So nice to spend time in there away from the Singapore heat.
The light show is a must see. When we where there it was a toy story promotion, which I dont think is as good as the normal show.
Best to later in the afternoon, so that you can stay for the light show which happens at 8 and then 9 pm",,
,,Beautiful,5,,We spent a good many hours here walking around and admiring the wonderful gardens that have been laid out here. Peace & tranquillity come to mind! There are also some nice places to eat with a mixed variety of offerings.,,
,,Day and night,5,,Astonishing installations worth multiple visits at different times. Night show is a must. Gardens are free access and are very large. Take time to discover all the different places,,
,,A Lovely Place To Walk,5,,We really enjoyed our time here. Its very nicely planned & designed with familes in mind. A great place for a morning meander,,
,,Man Made Miracle (Supertree),4,,"They have created a miracle called as the Supertree. This is a big structure and now they have grown plants on it so it has become a big tree in itself. Must see attraction for me. Also the light show is amazing, it takes place twice in the evening.",,
,,Tranquil,5,,"Headed for the Gardens as a precursor for the SkyPark. Beautifully maintained, Satay in the Garden was however a bit shabby in comparison. Did opt for the extra Sky Walk which was well worth it. Great tranquil spot in a city that feels busy.",,
,,Highlight of our trip to Singapore,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is an incredible spectacle, set by the river al little way out of the city centre. It鈥檚 two huge 鈥渆co domes鈥?house the 鈥淐loud Forest鈥?and 鈥淔lower dome鈥?habitats, filled with a fascinating array of plants, trees and shrubs.

The whole experience is very futuristic, from the soaring alien-like palm towers to the domes themselves, which feel like some kind of future city.

You can visit the outside areas, gardens and sculptures for free and certain areas are hugely popular with joggers, especially in the early evening. Entry to the two domes costs S$28 per person , but we booked through our travel rep and got four tickets for S$100.

The Cloud forest dome is centred around a great tropical waterfall. Queue for the lift which takes you all but 1 flight of stairs from the top, then walk your way back down, following the Aerial walkways and bridges that slope their way back down to the ground (a few stairs along the way). Great views out of the dome to the city and lots of amazing rain forest plants and flowers to admire as you go.

The flower dome starts with displays of cacti and succulents, moves through tropical plants and vegetation, includes orchids and finishes with a Rose garden, all easily accessible from sloping paths (also a few steps in places). The sheer size of both domes is incredible.

As if all this wasn鈥檛 enough, a short walk from the domes is the Mega Park, where the massive Palm shaped towers, connected by soaring aerial walkways, dominate the whole park. These huge structures are planted all the way up and give the impression of living buildings. The real magic happens after dark however when the towers light up and become the centre of a nightly free music and light show.

This is when you get the full futuristic city experience as colourful lighting brings the towers to life in time to classical music. To say the sight is breathtaking, would be an understatement, it is a memory that will stay will me for life.

I absolutely loved our time here and can鈥檛 recommend this enough. Visit the gardens in late afternoon, do the domes first then have an early evening meal in one of the on-site eateries (take the short walk to 鈥淪atay by the bay鈥?for affordable food in the outdoor food court).

Then return to the Mega Park for night-fall and the free light shows, which take place at 7:45 and 8:45pm. Tickets for the 鈥渟kyway鈥?aerial walk ways are S$8 and are pre-booked by time slot, so wait for your preferred time to go on sale and then buy quickly. We bought ours for 8:20pm, watched the earlier light show and then did the sky walk for magical views of the city by night.

An absolute must see in Singapore!",,
,,Don鈥檛 Miss Gardens by the Bay,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is an unique experience. Wear your walking shoes and plan to spend hours exploring the garden grounds, the Cloud Dome and the Flower Dome. Don鈥檛 forget your camera!",,
,,Highlight of our visit to Singapore,5,,"We visited Gardens by the Bay as a group of 10 with 6 teenagers in total. We were aged between 12 and 51 and I was a bit worried that perhaps the teenagers would be a bit bored but they LOVED it!

Do not hesitate to visit Gardens by the bay if you are visiting Singapore and especially if you have children and teenagers. It is an amazing experience for them.

Our tour company, Tour East recommended that we visit around 5.30pm in the afternoon to make sure we got the early light show and this was fantastic advice. Our tour guide said he has visited many times and he suggests this time because you get to see the Gardens in the light and then it starts getting dark and you see them from a different perspective. We were then able to get up into the Super Trees about 7.15pm to enjoy the best of the light show.

I would recommend that you pre-book with Tour East to have this same experience. You will see the Domes in the light and then as they get darker - the Gardens begin to change and then you enjoy the light show. It's amazing!!!",,
,,Must see in Singapore,4,,Plan on spending at least a full day wandering around. Fun place for all. Light show at the super grove trees was just ok.,,
,,Children鈥檚 playground,5,,"Excellent place to take the kids, bring their swimsuits and get wet at the splash pad and walk around the back to an amazing playground where slides twist, wobbly bridges and a lot of cool hide outs for the kids to roam safely",,
,,fantastic,5,,"I could go back again and again! There was so much to see both in the day and the night, and you definitely get a lot of walking in.",,
,,Very busy,3,,"A must but terribly busy when we visited and the signage is poor, we used the audio tour which took 20 minutes and to be honest it was enough for us. Probably age is a factor!",,
,,Impressive Flower- and Rainforest Domes,4,,"Both domes are very nice and worth the admission fee. In the flower dome was also an exhibition of roses and the parfume smell in the air was awesome.
The rainforest dome has right after the entrance a breathtaking waterfall
But also the entire construction of the landscapes are very impressive. I was there during the day but I can imagine that at night with all the lights it might be also great.",,
,,Singapore Gardens by the Bay,5,,Lots of it was free including the light/music show every evening but still worth paying extra to do the Cloud etc,,
,,"Magnificent constructions, requiring a full day's visit to appreciate.",5,,"A seemingly endless display of plants , flowers and the odd waterfall. Disabled friendly and also has motorised/bicycle tours. Not to be missed!!",,
,,Don't miss it,5,,"This place is just brilliant. The gardens themselves, but especially the two domes just don't miss them. Visionary and brilliantly executed experienced.",,
,,Spectacular Gardens,4,,We really enjoyed it. It was really busy and crowded but it was worth waiting to get in! The Cloud Forest was the more interesting one. With a huge waterfall.,,
,,Night for the lights,5,,Beyond wonderful every one just loved how the light show timed to the music. Highly recommend the experience,,
,,Loved it,5,,We wondered through for over two hours. Especially gorgeous once it gets dark. You can come and go with a stamp.,,
,,Amazing gardens.,5,,"Really amazing and beautiful gardens. All well kept flowers, trees and shrubs. Great for photography as the colours are so nice. As it gets dark the tall tree structures light up and are a unique experience.
Fountains and water attractions make it a place of beauty and a feeling of back to nature. Well worth a visit.",,
,,Beautiful fresh flowers of all sorts under one roof,5,,"Countless fresh flowers everywhere, smell great too. Best part of it all, it鈥檚 air condition, we bought the package which came with the shuttles to both Garden by the bay and the Cloud Forest.",,
,,"Not bad , relaxing",4,,Beautiful to see on a cool day. The weather was wonderful the day we went . A nyc place to rewind ones self . If not that tired better to walk on your own . I took the tram since we were already tired .the tram trip is over priced compared to its value .,,
,,"Lovely flowers in a well manicured, air-conditioned park. Do combine with visit to nearby cloud dome",5,,"Air-conditioned and well manicured park in the city. Nearest MRT a bit of a walk away at marina bay sands. Lots of tourists but nice, well kept flowers beds. Do combine with a visit to the neighboring cloud dome.",,
,,That waterfall!,4,,The waterfall was nice. Flowers are well maintained. Singapore known for its cleanliness thus that's a thumbs up for all the places I visited. There were shows nearby the vicinity too which is free. Overall nice experience and staff here were very good and helpful,,
,,Pretty but closes too early,3,,"Very pretty gardens, worth the visit. Closes at 9pm only though, compared to everything else in the town, that's super early. There is a light show on the giant trees at 7.45 and 8.45pm, but it's only 10 minutes worth.",,
,,My favorite attraction in Singapore,4,,We visited here during the nightly show with lights and music. It was fun to watch. The entire area has beautiful lights. A must do when in Singapore.,,
,,Simply Amazing,5,,"I had couple of hours in the evening on Sunday during a hectic business trip to the city and went to the gardens. Saw their laser show and did the sky walk. This is a lovely place, unfortunately I was short on time and could visit the main attractions inside the domes, but still it was the highlight of my short Singapore trip.",,
,,Absolutely Beautiful But Crowded,5,,"Gardens by the Bay was one of my family鈥檚 favorite tourist attractions in Singapore. Highly recommend you spend your time visiting the Cloud Forest section which features waterfalls, indoor gardens, and a cloud walk! Also time your visit in the late afternoon so you can also catch one of their nightly light shows! There is a fee to enter the Cloud Forest and Flower Garden but the light show is free. Great for the whole family!",,
,,"nice, but too many chinese",3,,"another place which is now almost wholly dedicated to hosting selfie stick jousts. If you do happen to be there during a break in the tournament, you may catch a glimpse of some nice plants. Some people may even go there especially for the flowers.",,
,,"nice, but too many chinese",3,,"another place which is now almost wholly dedicated to hosting selfie stick jousts. If you do happen to be there during a break in the tournament, you may catch a glimpse of some nice plants. Some people may even go there especially for the flowers.",,
,,Stunning!,5,,"I loved exploring Gardens by the Bay. I highly recommend people to visit the Cloud Forest it is a brilliant experience.

Their evening light shows are spectacular down at the Supertrees.

I recommend you bring your comfy walking shoes because their is a lot to explore! Amazing and a very memorable experience!",,
,,I expected more,4,,"I've been here in October, quite a high season for tourists and to be honest I expected more than just a light show by night here. Everything was really beautiful but still felt like missing something.",,
,,Gardens from around the world,5,,"This is definitely worth a visit! You can wander around the extensive outdoor gardens for free, including seeing the massive supertree grove. Then cool off in the 2 air conditioned domes, The Flower (our favorite) and the Cloud Forest (especially great for kids), about $25 for both. You can definitely spend a lot of time here. We didn鈥檛 try the OCBC Skyway, but it looked fun. It closes during rainstorms.",,
,,Truly amazing and spectacular spectra of plant life,5,,An amazing collection of the extremely old and very new plant and tree life laid out and presented in a spectacular celebration of the diversity of our plant life from around the world. The Cloud dome was our favourite - walked it twice seeing even more amazing plant life on the second walk than the initial jaw dropping vistas. You most definitely do NOT need to be a 'green thumb' person to appreciate the work that has been done and is being done to present this spectacular green view to those who visit here. Put it on your Must Do's list for Singapore.,,
,,Floral Fantansy,4,,"Fantastic place! Good to view and extremely the 4D Live! Flower Dome is never let you down, appreciate to see such pretty flowers in a cool room.",,
,,Worth a visit,5,,"My 2nd time here, my daughters first visit. Well worth a look, lovely gardens in immaculate condition. The 2 domes very interesting (and lovely and cool after being outside in the heat/humidity). Lots to see and do here. Has different food options, including a McDonalds. Nice giftshop.
Definitely recommend going here if visiting Singapore.",,
,,Worth the spend - don鈥檛 miss the light show!,5,,We did the tour on our first day. Nice and cool. Lots of interesting things to see and exciting walks. Worth the $! Be sure to stay for the light show with fabulous music!,,
,,beautiful esp. at night,5,,one of the dazzling Singapore sights. The evening contains a light show open to all and free; this is worth the time.,,
,,Visiting the wonderful Marina Gardens,5,,"Whether a day or night visit it is a truly magical and wonderful experience. Exotic, enchanting, exhilirating!",,
,,Breathtaking scenery,5,,"We visited the gardens in the late afternoon and watched the sunset from the Flower Dome. What an amazing experience! The entire place was alive with so many different colors, and the temporary exhibition of roses we saw was something out of a fairy tale. We saw the second dome after sunset, and it was equally worth it. Overall gorgeous, and very Interesting for plant lovers, or just anyone who likes a pretty scenery.",,
,,Beautifull place,5,,It is a great place. With young kids we also enjoyed the childrens area with the small water activities. Highly recommended to bring some swimming gear for the kids. Restaurant there is also very fair priced compared to other attractions in Singapore.,,
,,Flower Dome,2,,The roses were minimal and almost dying on the last third day of the season. This is not a good representation of the flower dome.,,
,,a must see,5,,wonderfulp area to walk trough and to explore. very well done. surprises around every corner. A must when you're in Singapore,,
,,Interesting and bonding visit,5,,"The Floral exhibit was exquisite. The 4D show does tell the world about garden by the bay! The complimentary tickets to Senior citizens do help us to bring parents who simply love plants and flowers. The shuttle bus service could have been complimentary to the senior citizens too. Instead of a 3 dollars per pax and normally tourist travelled only once. But the high price means lesser queue waiting time. Not many people would afford it after paying for the tickets to two domes and one special events. In fact, I really appreciate the efforts that NParks has put in to beautify Singapore gardens and parks.",,
,,One of a kind,5,,"We visited Floral Fantasy and it was absolutely magical. The floral arrangement was heavenly and the 4D show was well worth a visit! We also tried the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome - both beautiful, but the cloud forest was by far more stunning, making flower dome a much less intriguing attraction. My young one (3.5 yo) also enjoyed Floral Fantasy the most, even the 4D experience!",,
,,Amazing,5,,What an amazing garden in the middle of a city. Various sections throughout the garden blend effectively into an incredible site. Walking distance from a number of MRT centres commend accessing from Bay Sands.,,
,,Beautiful.. lost on children..less impressive than expected,3,,"The much photographed, much covered on all social media, gardens, are taken on their own merit, perfectly good to see and spend time when in Singapore. However like so much of this city state, it's got that hermetic and soulless aspect to it. One dome has European plants that looked a little too twee to be anything more than a meek attempt all perfectly manicured but a real let down. The other dome is more inspiring with a lovely waterfall and a fabulous walkway and plant selection.

However however in this world we live in, we always compare to prior experiences and I have to compare to Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew in Richmond England and The Eden project in Exeter area of England...both are so much more spectacular, real and take your breath away that's it's difficult to be impressed by the Singapore experience.",,
,,Wonderful Visit,5,,"Gardens by the Bay are well worth a visit. They are really beautifully put together, the cloud forest in particular. The light show outside through Super tree Grove was brilliant",,
,,Great place to visit,5,,"Gardens by the bay, although man made is a wonderful place with wide variety of plants. Orchids were really amazing with great aroma all around. The place was over crowded but still enjoyed being there.",,
,,A must to visit,5,,Magical garden. The show at night is simply marvelous. Had an awesome time visiting the gardens and was lucky to be there at the time of the show at night. Can visit this place again and again. Was a little tricky though to get a taxi back to the hotel,,
,,More to do than expected,5,,"I initially thought it would be an indoor garden and you鈥檇 walk around and that鈥檇 be it. However, there was several interactive activities and videos documenting the purpose of the gardens. The cloud forest definitely surpassed any expectation I had for it as it was more vast than I initially thought. It was very good value for money and would definitely recommend it to anyone in Singapore",,
,,Awesome collection of trees and plants,5,,"Gardens By the Bay is a great escape from the Singapore heat and humidity! There are 2 different indoor areas and a large outdoor area including the super tree grove. The indoor areas have great A/C and places to eat. One indoor area is dedicated to unique plants and trees from the different continents. This was my personal favorite as they have Baobab trees from Africa, Australia, and S America. The 2nd indoor area was centered around a huge waterfall and also contained exotic plants from tropical areas. Finally, I walked the elevated trail around the super trees. Only regret is I didn鈥檛 save this for night time!",,
,,a must visit if you love flowers,5,,I visited this place after 7 pm and I loved the light works that was done surrounding the garden. I may make another visit during the day,,
,,Must visit,5,,"Located between Marina Bay Sands hotel and the port. Access via Marina Bay Sands shopping mall. The gardens and the trees are free to access. Access to the flower dome and out forest and sky walk are extra. There is also a new 4d ride at an extra cost. The package for the two times and the 4d ride is $46 each which works out cheaper. The sky walk is separate for $8 each. Very well worth it. The domes offer a world of flowers and colour and have cafes inside. Take your time and stroll around. Very nice indeed. The supertrees are beautiful and offer some great photo opportunities. The sky walk is a different perspective and equally lovely. The 4d ride is ok. A bit tame but basically offers a dragon flys view of the gardens etc. You are the Dragon fly and there are some Disney chair effects to highlight your flight through the gardens. Nice not great.
All in all a fabulous morning and definitely worth it. Plenty of places to eat and drink and enjoy the gardens.
A definite must is to return to the gardens at night. Free entry to the gardens to see the light supertrees light show at 19.45 and 20.45. Lasts 15 mins. Bbc The trees light up to the music to provide a wonderful show. The trees are lit pre and post show and provide wonderful photo opportunities. You ca not miss this. Again it gets busy. Lots bring blankets to lie on the floor to look up during the shows. A good idea. Enjoy. Only downside is getting out afterwards. Busy and slow.
You must do this visit.",,
,,Beautiful Gardens,5,,I have been to Singapore many times but never visited the gardens.Beautifully laid out gardens with classical music playing in the background.Very relaxing atmosphere with lots of different plant zones of the world.,,
,,Amazing,5,,Experiencing gardens by the bay was one of the primary reasons that I came to Singapore. They didn鈥檛 disappoint. They are amazing and like nothing else that I鈥檝e seen in the world. Visit in the day and night for different experiences. Magic garden and cloud forest are also spectacular even if you are not into gardening! Singapore truly is a city in a garden!,,
,,"Beautiful gardens, superbly manicured",4,,"beautifully manicured gardens, just a great place to walk, end off your day at the satay stalls by the end, great food court there with buffet, typical hawker stalls and the satay stalls. the conservatories are stunning especially the indoor waterfall. definitely worth a visit",,
,,A must,5,,Super nice a must see easy access lots of walking lots of sights can be done in one day breathtaking,,
,,Incredibly beautiful,5,,"Loved the Gardens by Bay- just a beautiful attraction- one for Singapore to be very proud of! Very well kept- lovely flowers and gardens, an impressive architectural feat.",,
,,Fantastic! Do Not Miss,5,,"When in Singapore, do not miss Gardens by the Bay, a $1 billion dollar planned garden that is fantastic for the whole family.",,
,,Amazing experience,5,,It was wonderful and unique experience being here. Very different concept. You can get to know floral species of all over the globe. Some you have not even heard of. Very beautiful green houses and informative also. A must visit from me.,,
,,Perfect flower shot in the afternoon,5,,"One of the best attractions was the flower display in one of the hall. When late in the afternoon, the sunlight is perfect (not too strong) and ideal for taking pictures of the beautiful flowers. Some petals were almost transparent and beautiful.",,
,,Great fun!,5,,"Super fun experience, and truly an eye opener! Will definitely recommend my family and friends here!",,
,,Good experience,5,,"We had a nice couple of hours walking through all the different exhibitions. I would recommend coming at 1945 or 2045 to see the light show. You need to exchange you skywalk ticket for a time slot. If you do this early, you can see the show from above",,
,,Nice ambience during evening.,5,,"Happened to visit this park during Saturday evening, kind of breezy area where you can enjoy natural air, garden with fountain as well as instagram able spots to take. At around 8 PM they will perform a recorded music and the lights at Garden by the Bay will dance according to the music beats, beautiful!
And if you did not have a chance to have dinner yet, no worries as they have huge food courts with plenty food options.",,
,,Excellent!,5,,The supergrove trees were just spectacular. Loved the free show. We also went on the OCBC Skyway and the views from there during the show were amazing.,,
,,It was astounding!,5,,"Words can't describe the beauty of this entire complex. Educational, fun, great food, and of course shopping in the unique gift shops! There is something for everyone. Well worth the price of admission. The cloud forest is simply exquisite in the design and how people are moved through the venue.",,
,,Don鈥檛 miss the light show,5,,We visited here on our first night. In Singapore. We caught the last light show and it was incredible. The gardens are breathtaking and how they utilize sustainable energy to run the show is impressive. There is a deck you can get a great view and pictures from or just get close by going into the gardens.,,
,,Great spot. Something different,5,,Have been here a few times and always a pleasure. Went to the evening sound and light show and we and our 4 year old really enjoyed it. Dont bother with the skywalk tickets. Definitely not needed.,,
,,Must,5,,"Beautiful, is a must in singapore very kindlly staff. tickets go aroung 28 sgd for adults and is for the 2 atractions",,
,,Just incredible,5,,"This experience was testament to what Singapore is all about. The old and the new, the technologically advanced and the importance of nature. Take your time, walk through these incredible displays/ exhibits/ green houses - I don't really know what to call them. The olive trees were amazing - it reminded me very much of Tom Friedman 'The Lexus and the Olive Tree' - well done Singapore and thank you for sharing",,
,,Beautiful,5,,Gardens by the Bay was truly beautiful to visit. Be sure to go before sun set and get the domes done leaving time afterwards for the lights show and possibly the skywalk!,,
,,"Beautiful afternoon, great evening light show",5,,Great way to spend a couple of hours. Light show at night is free and wonderful. A not to miss site in Singapore.,,
,,Fantastic spot,5,,A visit to Singapore and this spot must be on the agenda. It鈥檚 not the easiest to get to on foot so I recommend using the Big Bus on either the yellow or green line which takes you to the door. One of the main attractions is supertrees which puts on a light show each night. The Singapore Flyer is also an attraction. Allow plenty of time.,,
,,Great,5,,The gardens are great for young and old there is lots to see and the show was very good just get to the grass area early to get the best spots,,
,,Amazing!,5,,Such an incredible place. Everything seems like a movie. The 鈥榝ree鈥?parts are amazing. It鈥檚 a completely different experience if you go in the morning and then during night-time.,,
,,Great visit!,5,,"We enjoyed the gardens a lot: cool climate, wonderful flowers and a breathtaking waterfall. A 鈥瀖ust see鈥?in Singapore.",,
,,SUPERB - Third visit and it gets better each time,5,,This time we took two of our granddaughters (who were on their first overseas trip) and they were blown away - being a Saturday it was very busy but we coped and found some quiet niches to absorb the wonders.,,
,,Beautiful space,5,,A lovey walk through well organized and beautiful garden settings. SKy and cloud walks gave great views.....not rushed,,
,,Great attraction,5,,Visited the Gardens by the Bay and did the Sky walk through the Super Trees. Great experience and views,,
,,Nice walk,3,,"We enjoyed the gardens and the open air parts are free to enter, all the enclosed areas had separate entrance fees. It was pleasant but not as striking as I had expected from reading about it. Go if you have spare time but don't worry if you miss it.",,
,,"Air conditioned, Oasis in man-made eden",5,,"Fantastic gardens set in two huge air conditioned green houses, a lovely breath of cold air in the middle of 30掳C feels like 37... Haha.
Many dollars (billions i was told) spent on these engineering marvels, the gardens are so well created and kept and a treat for gardening enthusiasts and children alike. The tree top walk and waterfall is really good and well worth the price.
All in all, a good hour or two in a cool environment, with the marina bay hotel sitting beautifully in the backdrop.
5 star",,
,,Top Spot,5,,The light show in the evening is impressive. Take a seat under one of the virtual trees and listen to the music while watching the light shows. The domes are a great place to visit on a hot day as they are both air conditioned and impressively planted.,,
,,Green space by the bay beside a beautiful city,5,,"As the name suggests, this is a garden by the bay that happens to be a massive garden. The unique feature of this garden are the two indoor themed areas and the 'super trees'. The two indoor themed areas are the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome that costs $28 per adult to enter both. Another great attraction is the Supertree grove and the OCBC Skywalk. The Skywalk costs $8 where you can walk along an elevated walk way between the Super trees. Make sure to come along at dusk to watch the 7.45pm and 8.45pm light shows. This is free and well worth staying to see the shows; one up close and one from a distance.",,
,,Fantastic place to visit. So much to see.,5,,A beautiful place to visit. There are so many different plants to see and you can view them from up high where the views are amazing and down below as well. So lovely and cool inside the dome on a really hot day. Staff were super helpful. If you purchase tickets beforehand it will save waiting in the queue. The kids loved it!,,
,,Fun for the whole family,5,,"Gardens by the bay is extremely fascinating with a wide range of plants and beautiful flowers. The setup is gorgeous and grand with fun activities to do. It is fantastic for the whole family. I do suggest that you bring your own snacks as there aren鈥檛 places to buy that (apart from the few vending machines here and there. Satay By the Bay was average. Prices were high on all meals though the taste was highly worth it. I discovered a beautiful dessert called mango ice with lots of toppings and that sort. The light show is not really made for kids as the times are late. They only go for fifteen minutes and there are two sessions per night. It was good but not the best light show you could see. Overall, it鈥檚 a fun and exciting way to see plants and you end up spending ours in the flower domes. Food is good and entertainment is limitless.",,
,,Great escape from the heat of July inside the domes,5,,It鈥檚 amazing what they鈥檝e grown / built inside the domes. Kids loved the waterfall. Just be prepared for a long walk in the sun/heat (although it does have great photo opportunities) if you鈥檙e walking from the Marina Bay Sands (about 15min),,
,,Species of the World at one place,5,,Excellent collection of plants and flowers from around the world nicely arranged in controlled environment suited for their development. We kept and maintained.,,
,,Nice,5,,Good place to visit. Best time to visit is late afternoon so that you can stay back and enjoy the night lights.,,
,,Stunning photos,5,,"Beautiful photos here, lovely cool reprieve from the tropical heat, beautiful place to spend an hour or two",,
,,Tickets are expensive,5,,"Tickets are expensive but in my opinion it is worth every penny when you are surrounded by lush,beautiful & fragrant flowers from all over the world. Rainforest cloud is simply superb to experience. 4D show on dragonfly was nice experience.",,
,,Unique to Singapore!,3,,"Pleasantly surprised with GBTB, they had cutesy light and sound show which we stayed for. Nice to go to say you鈥檝e done it. Unfortunately was getting dark when we went so only got to do that. Was free though!",,
,,Amazing To Look 馃憖 At!!!,5,,"This place is a must visit, it is absolutely beautiful and full of life. I recommend wearing comfortable shoes if you want to enjoy your visit or ladies can still wear heels but put a pair of flats in your purse *Just In Case*.",,
,,Do not miss Gardens By The Bay!,5,,"This was our first visit to Singapore for over 30 years & we wanted to see all of the major attractions. Gardens by the Bay is deservedly the number 1 attraction & is amazing.
We arrived in just in time for the evening 鈥渟uper trees鈥?light show @ were all amazed! Best of all it is completely free!
We then came back the following day & spent a further 3 hours plus to see the Cloud Forest & Flower Dome for $28 each & it was great value.
My advice is to arrive around 4 pm & have a good look around & wait for the light show.
The super trees look completely different by day & night so it is worth checking out.

Overall this is one of the best manmade attractions you will find in the world today!",,
,,Spectacular and Mesmerizing,5,,My husband and I really enjoyed the light show. Every day the light show begins at 7:45pm and 8:45pm. We love the scenic views and the supertree groves. This place is breathtaking. Must see when you visit Singapore! We will definitely be back.,,
,,A must-see place to visit,5,,"Even though you may have visited the Gardens before, there is always an event space where they change the flowers with the change of the seasons.

I would always recommend this place for locals and foreigners. Its affordable for locals, and an interesting walk for foreigners.

Take a walk and smell the flowers, it feeds the soul.",,
,,A fantastic experience,5,,We went here in July and found it to be beautiful. We went to all the different venues and all had different flowers and setups to explore. A must do in Singapore.,,
,,Such a beautiful display of flowers and plants.,5,,What a beautiful way to spend the day and so worth the cost of admission. Unfortunately the Cloud Forest Dome was closed for maintenance but still had a fantastic experience in the other areas. The Floral Fantasy display was beautifully done. Take the time to go up on the OCBC skywalk to get stunning views of the gardens and Singapore. The exhibits in the Flower Dome this month was Rose Romance Floral and it was just beautiful. There are some many small gardens and sculptures to see. Many good places for a yummy meal too. The gardens are beautiful at night too as they are lit up. Highly recommend a trip here when in Singapore.,,
,,Fairy tale experience,5,,"We went there just before sunset, so we could enjoy both day and night view,simply amazing experience of discovering tropical plants organized in beautiful way.Skywalk is worth to walk.Free entry but you need to pay if you wish shuttle or experience conservatory interior or wish to go on skywalk.you can just sit on ground grass and enjoy esp light show at night was really nice.",,
,,Biodomes,5,,"The Gardens by the Bay, is some of the best ways to spend $25 in Singapore. What they have managed to do in a small space is incredible. The slection of plants and flowers and the hidden sculptures located throughout the Gardens.",,
,,gardens by the bay,5,,"Very nice!!, dome,s are great, , the plant one is well done, perhaps not as interesting as the mountain one.( unless plants are your thing! ) light show at night is great!",,
,,Must Visit,5,,An extremely beautiful garden. We visited the 2 domes and the place is amazing. Heard from our guide that this is the most popular attraction in Singapore.,,
,,Worth a visit! 馃憣馃挄,4,,"Gardens by the bay is really awesome and it was worth a visit. You can watch the tree lights show for FREE. It was a great evening show, my friend and I really enjoyed it. If I'll be going back in SG again, I would love to visit here and watch the evening show with my family.

Flower dome and forest cloud are still good to visit for first timer in SG. Entrance fee was a bit pricey for me, but glad that we booked our tickets in Klook with discounted rates. Just go there earlier so you can have a lot of time looking around the places. There are different variety of plants and flowers in the flower dome and forest cloud which were really stunning. Domes are air-conditioned, you can roam around the place in a hassle freeway.",,
,,floral display,5,,"the 4 d section is rather enjoyable. Liked the flowers planted upside down and the moving ""balls"" of greens and flowers. Overall a picturesque beautiful flowers.",,
,,The best gardens I have ever seen.,5,,A tourist agent keen to sell tickets to anything and everything around Singapore said that we shouldn't leave Singapore without going to the Gardens by the Bay. Turned out he was correct. We drove around in a small electric bus with a commentary in English. That was great. We then walked through the flower dome and the cloud forest.it was a great experience. We are both over 65 and had no trouble walking around the domes. It was the usual Singapore heat in the outside gardens so a drink is useful.,,
,,Not to be missed,5,,This wonderful serene Garden needs to be viewed during the day and at night the canopy gardens are stunning . so view the wonderful plants from on high on the canopy give a new perspective on anything floral. At night they are all lit up and words cannot describe the stunning visual sights you will see.,,
,,The most amazing experience!,5,,"We didn鈥檛 go through the gardens, this review is for the evening light show. This is a free event that runs 7:45 and 8:45pm each night. The light show is set to music and is a FREE event. Get there early and find yourself a position in the middle of all the actions. Bring your bag to rest your head so that you can lay back and really take in the whole experience.

It is very busy so afterwards it is a good idea to check out the hotel and let the queues for taxis die down. We ate beforehand at the Lau Pa Sat hawker market in the city before hand ($5) meals, and then walked a pleasant 20 min walk through the city to the gardens.

Don鈥檛 miss this event, it鈥檚 everything you could imagine and more.",,
,,We loved it :D,5,,The most beautiful garden we have been in. We especially recommend the show which starts at 07:45 PM every day.,,
,,Stunning gardens,5,,I couldnt believe the variety of plants and flowers growing in that garden Every little place we went there were different species and all sort of plants from everywhere in the world. I couldnt believe the size of the desert roses. they put mine to shame,,
,,Great Place to Explore,5,,I really enjoyed visiting this place. One of the place to visit when you have a vacation in Singapore. Really worth it. It is hot but it doesn鈥檛 matter at all once you are on the place.,,
,,One of the best places to visit in Singapore,4,,"The flower dome, glass houses and the outdoor garden, everything is just beautiful and stunning. Super Tree Grove looks out of the world at night time with all the lights.",,
,,Lovely and peacfull,5,,The gardens are easy to get to bu bus and Metro. We took a direct bus from Orchard Road and caught the metro back. The gardens are quiet extensive and you need to put aside at least half day if not more to see all. The Cafe/restaurant inside the garden is quiet expensive and most of the time you need reservation. We only had two coffee and small cake and that was approximately AU$30.00 so be prepared if your having lunch ! The gardens are beautiful and definitely worth the visit..,,
,,A must to see,5,,Had a whole day in there due to the stunning views. We booked on line so saved money. What an amazing place to visit,,
,,This is a must while in Singapore,5,,Spectacular park with domes of gardens and flowers and waterfalls. Then you have the large trees with the walkway and the amazing light show at 7.45pm. We bought tickets online but these did not include the tree walkway. We didnt bother with that as we had just been up to the skypark on Marina Bay Sands next door. We bought dinner at the gardens cafes at very reasonable price and delicious. We visited from 4 to 8 pm but could have wondered another hour in the daylight. Lots of grass areas if you take your own food.,,
,,Rose 馃尮 romance,4,,Simply love the quarterly change in the variety of flowers ... great way to beat the heat too ... immersed yourself amongst the floral display! Good for family outings/ bondings and fellowships,,
,,The highlight of our Singapore holiday!,5,,"THIS IS A MUST SEE IN SINGAPORE !
If you see nothing else in Singapore you must spend at least 4 hours here.
Incorporating 2 glass houses and an outdoor garden; try and arrange the outdoor area walk when it is not raining as we did on suggestion by a guide. You are fully protected from the rain once inside one of the two domed glasshouses(largest in the world).
The outdoor garden alone is beautiful (look for the beautiful palm walk, peaceful meadow and pond of colourful goldfish) but the jewel in the crown is the Cloud Forest.
We also had a light lunch at Pollen in the flower dome which was nice and reasonably priced for Singapore. There are plenty of discreet eating options inside the entire complex.
We missed the light show this time but did the sky walk at an additional $8S each.
We took two teens to this amazing place and never had one complaint. I think they were actually blown away!
Gardens by the Bay is an absolute credit to Singapore and should be widely acclaimed.",,
,,Excellent.,5,,"If you like greens and plants, it is place for you, We really enjoyed our time there, and most importantly it wasn't crowded.",,
,,Evening stroll in the park,4,,Great place to take a nice and leisurely stroll through the various thematic gardens in the evenings without having to even visit the Flower Doom and Cloud Forests which are also 2 must visit places! A must for all foreign visitors as well as Singaporeans!,,
,,amazing,5,,"Must see if you are visiting Singapore. Try not to miss the light show in the evening. The cloud forest and the flower dome are amazing. The collection of rare plants from all over the world is amazing. Make sure to add on Marina Bay Sands to your itinerary with this. To see the light show in the evening from the 56th floor of the hotel is something to go for. Unfortunately, we missed it.",,
,,Always a Treat!,5,,This was my 3rd visit and each time it never disappoints! Love the Rose displays this time around. There is a special orchard display as well. Such wonders to uncover!,,
,,Make sure you leave plenty of time as there is so much to see.,5,,"These gardens are simply stunning and the light show in the evening is fabulous. Possibly not great for people that aren't interested in gardens but lots of space for children to run around, and lots of good picnic areas.!",,
,,Amazing! So much colour and variety!!,5,,"My wife and I visited the gardens on a day when the weather had taken a turn for the worse. We were certainly not expecting to see such a stunning collection of tropical flowers, shrubs and trees. Both domes were absolutely packed with all kinds of exotic plants in a huge variety of shapes and colours. If you come to Singapore the this is most certainly a ""Must Do"" attraction. Wonderful!",,
,,Amazing place,5,,Brought my family there. Amazing place very friendly for elderly children. Wheelchair friendly places. And I like that it's cooling in such a hot weather in Singapore. Bring a cardigan or jacket maybe for your kids or elderly.,,
,,Modernize botanical garden of Singapore,5,,"Amazing place not to miss in Singapore. There are open place you can visit for free. The 2 glass exhibition has a entrance ticket. There are local and foreign ticket prices. Both exhibits are air condition. One side exhibit the flora and fauna of the different spices of greens, plants and flowers. The other side focus on rain forest theme. There is a waterfall and you can walk on the walkway from the top. You can easily spend a few hours exploring this place.",,
,,Not Attractive,3,,"Not many good thing, need something new. I think better visit on the month of Apr. Very boring when you visit with kids or boys.",,
,,Great Light Show,3,,"Ok, coming from NZ, beautiful scenery is not rare so there was not any wow factor for us. But it was nice and hubby was very interested in all the nuts and bolts of how they built it. If you can time it for the light show it is a bonus. Again, you only need to see it once. There is an awful crowd going for the trains at the end but it is tolerable if you are expecting this. Kind of fun staring up at the Marina Sands Hotel and imagining hiring out the Pres, Suite for $17K a night.",,
,,Does not disappoint. Wonderful experience,5,,"Visited gardens by the bay on recommendation by big bus tour guide. Did not know what to expect as I'm not a flower type person and thought the experience would be boring but it was so amazing.

Went first to the cloud dome and was greeted by a huge waterfall that took my attention. Immediately you are transported to another forest world. So many things to look at and smell.

There is also an area with short presentations on climate change, deforestation and the likes. Really puts everything in perspective and gets you thinking.

Went also to the flower dome where you see trees, plants and flowers from around the world. Very impressive.

Would highly recommend a visit.",,
,,"Too noisy, too crowded, overrated",3,,"The gardens themselves are spectacular. They are ruined by the rudeness of the peasants who tend to visit. There are signs everywhere advising not to touch the plants. These are largely ignored by spoiled Asian brats whose parents actually seem to encourage the bad behavior.
However, if you can ignore this type of rudeness then the gardens are worth a visit. When it's time to leave, don;t be fooled by the Exit signs. They are for emergency use only. You need to find the Way Out sign instead.",,
,,Simply Awesome,4,,"There is an outside audio tour which cost around 12-15S$ but that doesn鈥檛 allow access to inside Dome / Garden so you have to go for two Domes tickets i.e Flower n Cloud Dome which will cost around 28$.
There is nothing to do inside gardens except viewing flowers n waterfalls which is really state of the art and you can鈥檛 get similar experience anywhere in the world

This is a paradise for Selfie Lovers as its so scenery as a real paradise

It may not be a good site for young children as my 13 years old son got extremely bored during the visit",,
,,Wedding Photoshoot,5,,Me and fiancee had our wedding photoshoot in cloud forest and flower dome. The place is very nice with artificial waterfall and beautiful flowers. Photo taken there is superb. Place is also cooling and a good spot to take photograph. We do not need to worry about the rain as these past few days is always raining. This is a good spot for phototaking and do take note there are certain them in some months. Do check on their website so that you can prepare yourself to take photos.,,
,,Tired,3,,"Interesting visit.
Its looking very tired.
Staff very inattentive . Don鈥檛 bother looking at you.
Did enjoy the indoor section.
The gentleman at ticket purchase was outstanding. Very good customer service and knowledgeable.",,
,,Amazing place,5,,Gardens by the bay really are out of this world. I would recommend making this place a priority if you are visiting Singapore. The light show in the evening at supertree grove is spectacular and the Cloud Dome is also out of this world. The floral displays are really amazing and we were blown away.,,
,,Unexpected problems,3,,"Do not prebook tickets over internet! YOU end up having to spend one hour to go and collect them. Also avoid the restaurant serving Hainese chicken as they only have three portions per day, although they advertize it as one of their main attractions. The garden is fine but littered with doubtful ingredients as wooden mushrooms, gemstones etc.",,
,,Beautiful,4,,"It was great when we visited the place. They had a light show on display with music. If only the weather was better, i would have rated it 5 star. Singapore is too humid :D",,
,,Amazing!,5,,The lights are amazing at night. They have this light show at around 7-8pm and 9-10pm I think. It's better to go to on the latter as there are fewer people and you will be able to see and take videos/pictures the light show performance much better.,,
,,Wonderful place,5,,Everything is just wonderful 馃拹. Esp super tree 馃尦. Enjoy the music and view to the bay such a amazing experience!,,
,,Flowers,5,,Good Place for the day and the family. Highly recommended anyone in Singapore and from other counties. The flowers are wonderful. No other place in the world has this kind of destination.,,
,,A must visit place,5,,Lovely gardens with lots of interesting features to see. You can spend several hours wandering around.,,
,,Nice,4,,It鈥檚 nice to visit and walk around to see the different flowers and gardens. Visiting the dome was excellent. Good to visit even if you are not into flowers,,
,,Fun for the family,4,,"Good experience and massive expanse of gardens. The futuristic looking trees are great and thr lighting on them is beautiful. The evening show is a nice to see as well.

Flower dome is huge and has regions for different parts of the world. Interesting to see the fauna of different regions in one commom dome. Tropical trees and cacti all living together is pretty interesting.

On the other hand I really wanted to like the mountain forest, but didn't end up getting fascinated by it. When you enter it, it is amazing! It's huge, has a waterfall right in front of you and the scene just looks great! However, not much else happens. I was expecting to experience a bit of a weather chsnge from the bottom to the top of the mountain, but in fact that felt much warmer at the top.

My parents had a great time the entire trip and I saw kids having a good time too. Decebt bit of walking to do so be prepared for that.",,
,,Stunning Seasonal Garden Display,5,,"Only had 3 days in Singapore, but made this my first point of call. Not disappointed with entry fee or the displays. Economical gift shop and took away wonderful memories.",,
,,Splendid and Fantastic,5,,"A must see, by far the most memorable place we visited in Singapore. The entire glass dome interior is air-conditioned and incredibly refreshing to be inside, away from the suffocating humidity outside, while enjoying the incredible array of flowers (flower dome) and the plants with waterfalls (cloud forest).",,
,,Ideal for photography,4,,Should visit the dome as well to experience the million dollar investment into this artificial garden!,,
,,Good for cycling to ECP,5,,"This stretch of road is good for night cycling from ECP, especially since the weather will be cooler and a lot of road to cycle.",,
,,Love the light show,5,,"Visited both day and night. Day is nice, night is awesome. Definitely an immersive experience under the trees",,
,,Loved it,5,,"We loved the gardens .. we did the cloud and flower garden halls and really enjoyed them both. So beautiful and a great place to cool off from the days heat.
We also watched the night show of lights at the trees and were I total awe of how beautiful they were.",,
,,A Beautiful escape from the heat!,5,,"Loved gardens by the bay - there are two domes included in your ticket - Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome. Both are in large glass domes, which are air conditioned providing an escape from the heat. Cloud Forest has a spectacular waterfall, elevated walkways and an amazing selection of plants!

The flower dome is almost as impressive with blooming plants from all around the world. A must see for gardeners.

The domes are meters apart and are closest to Harbourfront MRT. Afterwards you could explore Marina Bay Sands shopping centre (where the food hall is great) or have a drink at the top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel!",,
,,"Great display, location and environment!",4,,"Great display, location and environment! Not only a wonderful layout with interesting flowers Flora and Fauna but a nice respite from the heat.",,
,,Go at night,5,,Amazing. We did it in the morning but probably should have gone back in the evening. Next time definitely.,,
,,Second time,4,,"We visited Gardens by the Bay 8 months ago and were very impressed, this time we managed to access the elevated walk way which is a must With 3 light shows a night this place is truly worth a visit",,
,,Amazing,5,,"Didn't know what to expect,but was amazed.beautiful plants and flowers from all over the world .I loved the cactus section so many varieties as well as the water fall .it's a lovely temperature inside to wander around all day .I did the 2 domes and got a great price on klook.was very busy went early in morning .get a reentry stamp so u can enjoy it in the evening",,
,,Wow,5,,"Light show at night is phenomenal... Very crowded but worth it. As for a day visit, I would recommend allocating at least a whole day to explore. It's huge.",,
,,Floral Fantasy,3,,"Some of the flowers have withered. But still nice can taking a picture,though. Love Gardens by the bay鉂も潳鉂?
,,Spectacular - Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,This was one of the best displays I have ever seen particular the light show at night. The flowers and lighting was spectacular
,,A grand ecologically innovative exhibit,4.0,,Possibly the highlight of our short Singapore visit and fitting for the day of our 40th wedding anniversary! The energy producing Super trees both dominate the landscape and awaken an awareness that this is more than just a botanical park. The two adjacent domes - one dedicated to floral displays and the other to high altitude tropical forest conservation - reveal the service of advanced technology to environmental preservation. But that's not all. There are plenty of idyllic garden areas with sculptures",,
,,Lovely sculpted gardens,5,,"Very accessible via frequent $3 shuttles from Bayfront MRT. Vast outdoor walks with beautiful landscaping. 2 spectacular indoor gardens. Get the ""Friends of the Garden"" membership free entry to the 2 domes.",,
,,Experience for the entire family,5,,"My three children enjoy going to Gardens by the Bay because of the plentiful amount of different types of flowers and plants. My children are amazed by the brilliant colours of the different type of flowers. Another attraction is the water play area that my kids love to go to after the visit to the domes. And to end the day, we will dine at the nearby eatery that serves great BBQ food and other asian food.",,
,,Night time visut,5,,"It has been 14 years since I last came to Singapore, the changes are astounding !
Garden by the Bay was a lovely first night experience ! It was hot and busy, but we enjoy our walk around the colourful tress and watched the awesome music and light show !
The waiting time to climb the threes was close to an hour so we didn鈥檛 wait, maybe next time!",,
,,Your hear will skip a beat when you enter the Floral Fantasy,5,,"Best to plan half a day to walk around all the places. Good to take the tram ride so you know what is where and plan your walk afterwards. The Flowers, waterfall, everything is breath taking. Lot of places to take great photos. Must not miss it for sure.",,
,,Mother bonding with teenage daughter,5,,"Wonderful. Must visit when in Singapore. This one of the best tourist attractions in the world! Best to go in the mid to late afternoon and stay for the light show. With a deeper pocket you can take the various package tours. But without the tours it is worth every sight, sound, smell and taste.",,
,,Fantastic holiday,5,,"Gardens by the bay fantastic place to visit,beautiful flowers and shrubs and many more exotic plants to discover,loved the place visited a few times well recommended.",,
,,Great sight,5,,Loved it!!! Colours and amazing environment. Very cool so good to escape heat. Beautiful gardens and very accessible,,
,,Worth visiting,4,,Gardens by the Bay are worth visiting to enjoy perfectly manicured gardens on reclaimed land and great views of the city. Unfortunately the Flower Dome was closed so I missed it.,,
,,Gorgeous Gardens,5,,"Stayed in Marina Bay Hotel which allows free access to gardens and spectacular evening light show. It contains flower dome and cloud forest well worth a visit for the extraordinary floral displays ,water features and walkways within the cooled conservatories. Spend a few hours wandering all through the gardens. But the best part is the light show with music. Excellent choices of well known songs from 70s and 80s that will lift your spirits.",,
,,"Lush greenery,",5,,"With it's multiple conservatories that are a treat for nature lovers, sprawling gardens and the 60 feet high walkway, Gardens by the way is perfect for an evening getaway.",,
,,Beautiful place,5,,"Stunning place but be prepared to do a bit of walking. We did 18000 steps this day! Totally buggered but had a great day. Wheelchair friendly and there is a shuttle bus if you鈥檙e clever enough to catch it to cut down your walking. The show started at 7:45 and went for about ten minutes but was just beautiful. You can buy ticket to go up onto the walkway in the trees. Personally we saw just as much from the ground so wouldn鈥檛 bother.
Could spend a long time here and at the Cloud garden.",,
,,Beautiful Nature,5,,"Reclaimed land made beautiful with gardens. A place to visit in the quiet and cool (if possible) in the late afternoon. Stay till the lights come on, especially the Supertree Grove, the Silver Garden and the Golden Garden. Try to see as much of the gardens as possible, but make sure you visit both the paid areas - the Flower Dome and the Cloud Dome.",,
,,Good attempt for replica of nature,4,,"Really appreciate a huge effort to develop this place as another talk of the town landmark for local people and attracting tourists.
I鈥檇 say you should visit there especially two domes; floral dome and cloud forest. Both places are in well maintained status.
During my visit, there is a Rose show inside. It is nice, but it doesn鈥檛 contain various type of roses, just decorate space with roses. It is a bit disappointed, but still enjoy with landscape at overall.
In cloud forest, highlight is artificial waterfall. That 鈥榮 it. It is not obvious better than other botanical gardens in other countries. With limited space, you can enjoy walking tree top walk from upstairs down to ground. I like this idea which bring you a value to visit the place.
For QCBC skywalk, it costs S$8, but you need to get an admission session and be in line for 20 min. Then you can enjoy 15 min( peak hour) or a bit longer. To me it is not worth. You can not see too far view from the skywalk. Also with many people you mayn鈥檛 get good picture. If you have time, it is ok to go at least for checking in it.",,
,,Spectacular Gardens,5,,We really enjoyed the Cloud Forest & Flower Dome. There has been lots of effort into these magnificent garden creations. Make sure you have plenty of time to wander around. It was also suggested to visit the Gardens By the Bay in the late afternoon so you are still there for the evening 8 pm when the Famous Tree light show starts. The Tree Tops walk will cost you an extra $8 but is worth it as long as you aren't scared of heights. There is also a tram that will drive you around the gardens for $3 which can be good in the heat while allowing you to see more of the Garden Park.,,
,,Well worth a visit,5,,"The Gardens covered a large area but were nice to walk around. The Cloud Dome was great, interesting plants and the high treetop walk was worth the visit. Lovely when the mist came around later in the day. The Flower Dome was beautiful and colourful, especially the rose display which was on when we visited. It was like fairyland with the lights on at night. The garden displays from different countries were very nice too. The super tree light and sound show at night was spectacular.",,
,,A nice place to escape hot weather.,5,,I went with family everyone love this place so much we spend time in this place 3 hours due to limit time of travel plan.,,
,,Another modern marvel on this tiny island,5,,It鈥檚 stunning beauty is a testament to what man can achieve given enough money and ambition. As with many things in Singapore it may not wow you with its size but the effort made in constructing and designing this attraction more than makes up for it. Definitely worth a visit!,,
,,Garden experience,4,,Fun and worth our time but a couple hours was enough. We did the two domes and walked around. Personally I like the jewel more. Airport garden has a unique more fun experience.,,
,,One of Singapore鈥檚 many must see attractions,5,,"Incredible site. The two 鈥済reenhouses鈥?are magnificent with wonderful plants and a high wire walk around the heights of the Cloud Garden with an amazing waterfall feature.

The huge plant like structures that dominate the skyline come alive at night when they are lit up and there is also a great light show with music every evening that is worth waiting around for. There is a sky walk which isn鈥檛 open all the time but is great to do if it is available. Entrance to both of the greenhouses requires a ticket as does the sky walk. The garden walks and the light show are free.",,
,,A nice way to spend some time,4,,I trip that takes about an hour +. You see A large waterfall and nice plants. Fun place for a day! Go here before you see the Gardens by the Bay,,
,,Wow,5,,Unique human made Gardens . Perfect place for walking and taking wonderful shots . You must visit it twice at day and night,,
,,"Flower Dome, SKYWAY + SUPERTREE GROVE",5,,"If you like flower photography, this Flower Dome will probably be somewhat of a haven, and the same goes if you just like to see beautiful flowers. The Skyway, you can walk among the supertrees and enjoy amazing views. It鈥檚 a little scary if you鈥檙e afraid of heights, but it鈥檚 safe. You also can enjoy the Garden by the bay light show around 7:45pm and 8:45pm,",,
,,A must do when in Singapore,5,,I totally loved this place. It takes time to go trough it all so see to it that you have plenty of time. Go by late evening or night so you can see the spectacular light show at 19:45 or 20:45 it's amazing. My kids loved everything about this place and me to.,,
,,Excellent Children festive,4,,"We went there together with 2 other families with their kids.

All the kids have great fun going through the stations/ trails and doing the larva lamp workshop.

There are some hiccups with the booking system but we manage to get it resolve subsequently.

Overall well done to the organiser. The kids enjoyed it.",,
,,Amazing,5,,Amazing place looking location wow at night so amazing really I love this place and I will come back again,,
,,All Shades of Color,5,,I went with family.. Had a great experience and really enjoyed the decorated flowers all over the garden. Its place where you can go with small kids and family and spend full day including bay place. Go with your camera if you have.. I am sure lots of beautiful memories you can capture there...,,
,,Gardens by bay,5,,"Beautiful activity to do . Easy to get to by MRT or taxi . We had a wheel chair and it was very easy to get around . Beautiful huge glasshouses, presented well and lovely and cool in the Singapore heat . A lot to see could do a short or long visit .",,
,,Lovely gardens,5,,"Worth the money to pay to enter the extra gardens as they are air conditioned and have many interesting gardens and plants. Loved the quirky Alice in Wonderland display, very cute.",,
,,Superb place,5,,A really nice place to come and walk around for free. Several things to do such as the Skywalk for a small fee. Great way to spend a few hours. Plenty of food and drink available.,,
,,Magical,5,,"Wonderful, magic place to visit. I could spend all day soaking up the place. It was a pouring down when we visited the green houses so we got the little shuttle bus across the gardens which was speedy and good",,
,,Sensational,5,,"Futuristic and down to earth at the same time. A beautiful garden, completely free just as the two evening shows. If course you can visit the two greenhouses too, but those are not free.
For best view go near the feet of the giant trees and be early because it's pretty crowded.",,
,,Nice place for family fun,5,,Very cooling experience on hot weather. Good places to go with family and kids. Both the dimes are definitely worth the visit. Don鈥檛 miss the light show.,,
,,Dont miss this as any cost,5,,The night light show is just a wonder of the world. I felt like I was in another planet never mind another country.,,
,,A must see,5,,Amazing how much work and how high tech this area is ! The light show is a must see absoulty amazing,,
,,Man & Nature just magical,5,,"Singapore鈥檚 architectural masterpiece of excellence, showcasing a Harmonious blend of nature & man made structures. This breath-taking and awe-inspiring attraction can only be truly understood in person. Just magical and absolutely unique, nothing else like it on the planet. No trip to Singapore is complete without a visit to this modern marvel.",,
,,heaven on earth,5,,"very beautiful garden, a lot of greenery, many many varieties of tree. I spend the entire day here and i doubt i have seen all. The weather is a bit too hot and humid but thankfully there are lots if shaded areas.",,
,,Out of the world,5,,This place is so beautiful that you would not like to come out of such a peaceful world of flowers. The light show is not to be missed event. Fantastic collection of flowers and water fountains.,,
,,Beautiful Blooms in the Afternoon --> Romantic Musicals at Night at the Supergrove,5,,"In tropical Singapore, the heat gets to everyone.

Escape to Gardens by the Bay as you wander through beautiful blooms and plants from all over the world (the theme changes each quarter - we caught the Romantic Roses exhibition) amidst the much needed cool airconditioning.

Catch the waterfalls in the sky as well. It focuses on a different set of trees and plants.

Aim to spend 2 - 3 hours exploring both exhibits above, then head to the Supergroves by about 7pm and grab a seat whilst you wait for the Supergrove (Giant Lighted Tree) musical and light performance at 7.45pm.

Bring a mat - it's much more comfortable to lie flat and look up.
Utterly Magical and Romantic : )",,
,,Recommended,5,,Very nice to walk through and sinply relax a little bit. The entrances fees for the two domes are quite high 28 $ for both which we decudes to not make as the rest is also alreasy fabulous,,
,,Photoscenic Place,5,,Excellent place to visit with family where you can spend 3 to 5 hrs approximately. completely covered doom space park with huge collections of colourful flowers. Never miss this place.,,
,,Always Intrigued by Floral Displays,5,,"Everytime there is a change of display, we are sure to visit and better still being a hold of the annual pass, there are some discounts for items purchased too.",,
,,"Beautiful gardens, waterfalls and views of Singapore for all the family",4,,"I never knew about this beautiful place until I arrived at Singapore airport and it was suggested to me as a place to visit. I鈥檓 glad that I went to the Gardens By The Bay and discovered the views from the bridge. You can see a lot of Singapore.
In the domes you can also experience some beautiful waterfalls and plant life.
In the evening there is a spectacular light show with music.",,
,,My favorite place in Singapore,5,,"This is my favorite place in Singapore. If you are into greeneries - this is your place. it has 2 special domes, and thematic gardens. They also have light shows in the evening in their super trees. Its accessible, just behind the Marina Bay Sands. There are some restaurants for those who will get hungry.",,
,,Amazing,5,,Thus was a truly amazing sight. The variety of gardens is fantastic. This section is actually free and you need lots of time to walk around it properly.,,
,,Asia Avatar,5,,"I have been visiting garden by the bay countless times over the years. It has never ceased to amaze me with the greeneries , varieties of tree , landscaping and events planned throughout the year. Dec is always the best time to visit with cooler weather, the christmas lightings, shows and Christmas markets.",,
,,Gardens by the bay,4,,"A must visit for any Singapore tour. Easily accessible by public transport. Greenery all around, something singapore is very famous for. Nearby attractions include Cloud Forest and Marina Bay sand. Have some good light shows during night.",,
,,Amazing,5,,"This facility has amazing architecture, collection of plants, beautiful scenery, interesting spots for taking pictures and enjoy the landscape.",,
,,Nice day at the gardens,4,,"We have been here several times - each time due to the different flower exhibits that they put up every few months.

This time - we came because of the Toy Story special area and went into the flower dome as well. The current displays at the flower dome are mainly roses. Not as nice as interesting as other times where they had tulips and other flowers. The roses are not plenty and no wow factor.

There is a special light show near the toy story area the night we were there and it was nice.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,"If you like the Eden Project you are going to marvel at these structural glass domes.
They contain roses, palms exotic fauna and high level walking platforms.
When buying entry tickets make certain you get to see what you want, ticket sellers are under such pressures to sell fast due to waiting numbers of public.
But prepare to be amazed. if not only by the flora & fauna but by the high level platforms you walk , its marvellous.",,
,,Beautiful way to spend a day in Singapore,5,,"We spent a fantastic day at the Gardens by the Bay. The gardens are amazing and offer so much variety. The highlights were definitely the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest Dome and they are definitely worth the entrance fees to see amazing diversity of plants, beautiful garden designs and creative sculptures and structures - especially the carved wood models of dragons, eagles, horses etc. The only slight disappointment for us was the additional charged display called Floral Fantasy. This was a timed entry display where you had to book for an hourly slot and was $20 per person. It literally took us less than 10 minutes to walk around the display - so it was poor value compared to the combined $28 for the much more impressive Flower Dome and Cloud Forest Domes.",,
,,Children's Festival,4,,"Toy Story 4 - Children's Festival.
At Supertree Grove, Gardens By The Bay.

This is our second time festival experience here, after their Christmas Village festival 2 years ago.
Comparing it two, this event not that great as their Xmas events. But still, an outdoor event, especially the one in Singapore most famous Supertree Grove, it's still amazing !",,
,,Beautiful a must see on a trip to Singapore,5,,The architecture feet was impressive. The array of Plants outstanding. Make sure you take a jacket it is a little chilly inside. Great place to take pictures,,
,,Top venue,5,,Walked around Bay of Gardens Marina Bay Singapore. Beautiful place. Clean and full of flora to see. Worth a visit.,,
,,Superb Attraction,5,,"Exciting places to see are located in here ( Cloud Forest , Flower Dome & Super Trees ) Offers attractions that are absolutely enjoyable. Really worth your time and money spent.",,
,,Lovely evening @ Garden by the bay,5,,One of the must see attractions in Singapore. I believe one day is not enough if you want to see it and enjoy the activities are provided...he light up trees were awesome. The music played with the light show was very interested.,,
,,Gardens by the Bay Singapore,5,,Beautiful location at marina south. Singapore. This stretch of land was reclaimed from the sea. The flower dome is very unique showcasing tropical flora and fauna which is regularly refreshed with different theme. Reasonable admission charges. The external garden is free and it鈥檚 even more beautiful in the night when all the giant trees are lighted up ! Great location for photography indeed!!,,
,,A garden for everyone,5,,Very nice garden with different attractions which changes every few months. One of our favourite attraction in town.,,
,,Toy story at Garden by the Bay,4,,Beautiful light show with Toy story theme during school term break. Interactive games stalls for the kids to enjoy and redeem a set of the sticker. A wonderful experience to hang out with the family,,
,,Good Experience,5,,"We visited the two main domes only as the weather was very hot and humid. We used the shuttle bus from the main entrance which was only $3 each, very clean and effective. Once inside the main domes we were surprised by the different environment. Not only was the vegetation amazing, the temperature was mid-20s with ramps, escalators and lifts available for us with knees not as good as they used to be.
Allow plenty of time to take in all of the different experiences. We went in late morning, early afternoon and we had plenty of time and it was not crowded. We used the Big Bus to get there but there is also a subway station that would be effective in accessing this site.
Fully recommended for a half day adventure in Singapore.",,
,,Very nice night show and beautiful trees and plants,5,,"Just fantastic. Visitors can see an array of garden exhibits, from the Succulent Garden and Baobabs featured just before, to the South African Garden, South American Garden, Californian Garden, Italian Flower field and Australian Garden with native trees - the Flower Dome has it all!",,
,,Beautiful decorations especially at night,5,,Huge stalk of flowers up to the sky beautifully decorated. At night sparkling of lights shining interchangeably with various colours together with music. You can enjoy with ease to relax your nerve. Food available nearby and you can stay the whole day resupplying your energy. It is a place most suitable for a whole family to spend a day here.,,
,,Another stunning Singapore attraction.,5,,This is another jewel in Singapore's crown. The gardens are well worth a visit for all ages. They are excellently maintained the Domes are climate controlled making them very pleasant to stroll around. We saw some stunning displays.,,
,,Fantastic view,4,,One of the must visit in Sg. Nice and relaxing nature's view and an iconic sight of Marina Bay Sands and Sg Flyers,,
,,Christmas Light Up,5,,Love Gardens By the Bay so much. The light up was awesome. The music played with the light show was entertaining. A must to visit for tourists and locals.,,
,,Amazing at Night,5,,Enjoy the breath taking view of Gardens by the Bay especially at night. Perfect for picture opportunities. Family enjoyed this trip.,,
,,Beautiful light show at night if you don't mind the crowds,5,,"The Super Grove has a light show with music at 7:45pm each night, but be prepared to fight the crowds. Sneak away to get in the taxi queue a few minutes before the show ends, or you'll be in line forever. The closest MRT station is near the Marina Sands Hotel, but it is quite a hike if you have kids with you. This is definitely worth a visit while in Singapore!!",,
,,"Beautiful, must visit for nature lovers",5,,"If you are a nature lovers or care about nature then this place is a must visit . They have created artificial forests & detailed information about each plant is written , it was a refreshing & novel experience, please do include in your trip",,
,,Singapore chill out,5,,"The garden domes were featuring tulips while we were there this time! The exhibition and facilities were amazing...we have been before, but the new exhibition made it all 鈥渘ew鈥?again!! Staff were both obliging and polite... Would highly recommend...great value!",,
,,Breath taking views of the bay and lights show,5,,"This place is so beautiful and dreamy. Its just exquisite. Like walking in real life 3D mode of some Disney animated cartoon. The lights the music, the views, everything is magical",,
,,Awesome place,5,,"This place really surprised us. There are bits you have to pay to see. But the entry is free and 90% of the park is free.

If you have kids, they will love the water fountains. It鈥檚 an area with loads of water sprinklers and kids and adults can just run free getting wet (great to beat the Singapore heat). Very good toilets near by with shower facility if needed.

The place has food outlets.

Great photo spots.

You can easily spend a whole day here and all for free.",,
,,Alice in Wonderland,5,,"Loved visiting gardens by the bay. Cloud forest and flower dome are both cooled environments, a nice place to get away from the heat and humidity. The indoor waterfall was amazing to see. I especially liked the Alice in wonderland feature inside the flower dome. After walking around both domes we walked to Supertree grove and watched the light show, a lovely way to end the evening.",,
,,Garden relaxation and exercise,5,,Beautiful flowers and landscaping enhance the atmosphere and ambience of the iconic gardens in Singapore. It is always worth repeated visits.,,
,,One of the best attractions in Singapore,5,,Nice place with garden and also cloud forest is very good with many types of trees and flowers which is man made scenic beauty,,
,,Stunning.,5,,"An amazing place, with pleasant gardens, and two domes which are worth visiting. The highlight is the evening show using the tall towers with the Marina Sands to the background. A magnificent show.",,
,,"Loved it, so much to see",5,,"We spent an afternoon and an evening exploring this amazing space, & probably only saw half. The two domes were unexpected & beautiful. The Cloud was breath taking & made you feel like you were in a fairy tale. We arrived at 7.30pm to see the free night show. It鈥檚 very busy but there are plenty of spaces to watch from. We had no idea what to expect & were delighted when there was music & a coordinated light sequence. You could easily spend x2 days exploring & relaxing in the gardens",,
,,Loved it,5,,Don鈥檛 miss this place. I loved it. Never saw such a beautiful place. Must go to flower dorm. It鈥檚 value for money. It feels so good over there,,
,,Great place for kids now,5,,"Very good displays all improved since last trip Just added an amazing tropical garden , the flowers and the frogs from South America were incredible ... nothing like it anywhere in the world I鈥檓 sure W",,
,,Surprisingly good,5,,"We didn鈥檛 expect too much from the beginning, but we feel that it is a must visit spot in Singapore. We did not regret. It wasn鈥檛 too crowded when we went. We were able to walk through the garden exhibits and look at different types of flower species. It was fascinating! Then we went over to the Cloud Forest, it was so pretty and so worth the ticket. It had a gorgeous waterfall right when you enter the exhibit. We walked through the whole exhibit and did the tree walk on top. It was so neat to see the orchid exhibit, so unique. It was a beautiful rainforest. I also like the theater room at the end where they talk about global warming. It was very educational. There was also a crystal exhibit, which was not as fascinating. Overall, it was a well thought out of exhibit. Will do it again!!!",,
,,Amazing visit,5,,Beautiful and well organized - they are very creative with the attractions making you want to come back,,
,,Gardens by the Bay!,5,,"Don鈥檛 miss this place and come back both night and day for different experiences. The Flower dome and Cloud dome, although you had to pay, were absolutely amazing! Allow half a day to see everything.",,
,,Beautiful Display and Children's Festival Event,3,,"The only thing that can be improved is the crowd.. too many people spolls the tranquility of the gardens. Love the ad hoc events that are organized in parallel like the children's festival. The rose romance display was a bit disappointing, the flowers were not concentrated enough, and many were dying.",,
,,Wonderful Garden of Singapore,4,,"It is a place for us to relax ourself when we are tired, seeing all the beautiful flowers at a cool nice place, it is also a showcase for Singapore to the world.",,
,,Lovely way to spend a couple of hours,4,,"We have been here a couple of times before but always good to take friends to check out the lovely 鈥榯rees鈥?and surroundings. Was a little overcast the day we went but still love to admire the structures. Unfortunately, we didn鈥檛 have time to visit them during an evening/night.

Ended with a lovely selection of lunch dishes at the Satay Club, all very reasonably priced and awarded with a sighting of otters in the bay.",,
,,"Beautiful, worth the visit!",5,,"Always wanted to go here and it didn't disappoint! Both gardens were beautiful, well set out and so nice to get out of the heat of Singapore for a while. Great to see what grows in the different parts of the world!",,
,,Stunning & Wonderful,5,,"As a resident of Singapore, firstly I am proud to see Gardens by the Bay have attract many tourists & local especially during the school holidays. It is very convenient for whole family to enjoy. Kids will enjoy the water playground. Beautiful scenery to take perfect family photo. Many foods outlet. Overall: Satisfied",,
,,beautiful! must visit!,5,,absolutely beautiful. was an opportunity to learn more about our ecosystem. got to learn and see plants that i never knew existed.,,
,,Great Way to Spend a Morning,5,,"I know this attraction os pretty amazing at night when they have the light show, but I spent a lovely morning exploring these amazing gardens. Other than the fantastic towering light trees, the massive indoor dome provides a great experience in air conditioned comfort. It costs S$28 to get in, but it is well worth it. The exhibit is efficiently laid out and crowds can move through the place in a one-way, orderly fashion. As you wind your way through, various habitats are revealed, each with different plants and flowers. There is signage, but it can be hard to read with all of the people around. It would have been nice if they had offered a self-guided audio tour, but I did not see one on offer. As you come into the second dome, you are greeted by a massive waterfall. You then proceed up a lift to the ""cloud Walk."" This winds around from the top of the dome through various habitats and the back side of the waterfall. At the end of the journey, you can view a film about the future if climate change continues unchecked. And then you have to go through the obligatory gift shop before exiting. The outdoor gardens are equally impressive, but the heat and humidity of Singapore made that more of a perfunctory visit.

I think this is a very good use of one's time while in Singapore. As just about everything in this lovely city, it is truly first class.",,
,,Night tour included the giant trees鈥?show,4,,Took a night tour that brought us to the 鈥楢vatar鈥?trees light and music show. It was retro night and the music was excellent. My son and I loved the tunes including 鈥楽aturday Night Fever鈥?and Abba songs. It was not as crowded due to the rain so we had prime viewing. Do be ready for people unaware and who wander into your video taping area. We didn鈥檛 have time to explore the Walkways linking the trees but it looked fun. The Garden Rhapsody light and sound show is a definite must visit and if you have time the flower dome and cloud forest look like good places to visit as well. The trees mimic live trees in that they have technology which allows them to convert sunlight into energy and collect rainwater. There is also a restaurant at the top of the tallest tree but we never made it there. Overall a great place to visit.,,
,,An evening to remember,4,,"We arrived at Gardens by the Bay about an hour before sunset, plenty of time to visit and take photos in the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest. We're gardeners and plant lovers in general, and for us the standout was the little-advertised succulent and cactus section within the Flower Dome. Simply stunning collection. The flower displays in the Flower Dome, on the other hand, were twee and disappointing. And while the Cloud Forest was spectacular and well worth seeing, those succulents, bottle trees and cacti take the prize as our ""must see"" suggestion for plant lovers.
Afterwards, once the sun had set, those wonderful, cheezy illuminated mega-trees stole the show. Definitely stay there to see them, too.",,
,,Beautiful Singapore,5,,"A lovely day spent in Singapore at Gardens by the Bay. Not too crowded, amazing floral delights & delish food.",,
,,Floral Fantasy New Attraaction,5,,"I thought it was near the domes but it wasnt. It was near the bridge that connects MBS to Garden by the Bay. I bought the tickets online at newly open discounted price. There was timeslot to choose from.

I bought the 6pm timeslot but i was late and went in at 6.20 pm instead. It was a good thing as when i go in, everyone already completed visiting the place and queuing up for the 4D ride.
The decoration is nice and amazes me. I took pictures and videos with my gf. There was this exhibition of mini dart frogs. They are really small and cute.

After walking through everything, we went back to the start again and walk again. Then we queue about 20-30 mins for the 4D ride. 4D ride was still alright, but it was cool also",,
,,Superb,5,,What a beautiful place. The walk in the gardens is magnificent. Taking a stroll amongst the gigantic tall supertrees is beautiful. The set up of the gardens gives the opportunity to see both nature and architecture. Wait till the evening when they have a inspiring light and sound show.,,
,,Nice Place.,5,,"Nice flowers on display, great ideas for landscapes. We love the place and enjoyed the flowers and the flight of the dragonfly in 4D show. Toilets are clean too!!",,
,,SOUND AND LIGHT SHOW = WOW,5,,Stunning area with amazing sights. The Gardens by the Bay are an absolute must do on anyone鈥檚 bucket list! Skywalk through the SuperTrees had me in awe. The nightly sound and light show was spectacular.,,
,,Flowers not fresh on display,2,,"We visited Floral Fantastly. Noticed that many or almost half of the flowers were withering..
Also visited the Flower Dome. Many of the roses were withering too. Wonder if they take stock & replenish their display. The Californian gardens that require visitors to climb a flight of stairs up just to see a very small section was also not nicely done up.
We r a family of young & seniors.",,
,,Never fails to impress!,5,,"We visited the Floral Fantasy exhibit and enjoyed it very much. The flowers were amazing and the exhibit was beautiful. It was also nice to have the 4D ride included in the ticket - it was enjoyable. We also went to the Supertrees area and again found the gardens to be amazing and beautiful, especially at night. We also loved the Garden Rhapsody night show.",,
,,A must do,5,,"If you are in Singapore for any length of time this is a must do. There's so much to do and see. We only did a half day there but we were blown away by it. Did the cloud forest, flower dome and the sky walk. All excellent. The kids loved it all. Did the water park at the end. Nice way to cool off and rest for a bit. Would loved to have been able to go back the next day to see more.",,
,,Nice airy walk.,4,,"We walked there from the Marina Bay Sands hotel. Everything seems man-made but looks amazing. We like the light show at around 7 or 8 pm. It's a shame it was raining when we went up on the OCBE Skyway because we were asked to rush down. Having paid around 10 SGD per person, we only walked on the skyway for maybe 3 mins before rushing down. The staffs said that is it, they can't help with anything.",,
,,The Best,5,,"Second time there and it never fails to surprise me. The gardens are superb and the place is so cool, a great relief from the humidity outside. I will go there again and take my time to enjoy the experience.",,
,,Mesmorising presentation of the whole attraction.,5,,Continually more and more to see at every turn. A great insight to ability to present this to the tourists.,,
,,Gorgeous place to explore and spend a couple of hours,4,,"We arrived early evening and enjoyed everything we could do and see, great place for photo's too. Unfortunately the main reason we went in at that time was to attend the Christmas wonderland activities and due to wet and stormy weather conditions it was cancelled for the evening. If we had more time would have happily returned. A must see for anyone visiting Singapore. Nice places for a snack or drink and very family friendly as the kids can exhaust themselves and lots of room to get around with prams on all walking paths.",,
,,A Tranquil Walk,4,,"A noce moring walk through the gardens, which are very quiet and calming. The whole place it a lush green with the wet season and an easy way to spend a few hours.",,
,,Stunning,5,,You have to give it to the Singaporeans they know how to build what you think would be impossible. These glass houses are amazing. We visited the Cloud and flower domes. Absolutely loved them. They are lovely and cool inside. Easy to get to from MRT. You can walk to the station through the lovely grounds. Also easy to visit Marina Bay Sands from here.,,
,,Magnificent splendor,4,,"We had to see this beautiful place. After taking all the bus lines around, and in, it's easy to jut hop off and back on, but we wanted to walk around Marina Bay to get there and experience the whole thing. It was well worth the effort. It was a very hot day, so quite a commitment. The walk across from Marina Bay Sands Hotel is the best way to see Gardens By The Bay. It's quite spectacular. We entered through The Dragonfly gate, beautiful to see Dragonfly Lake. You can pay extra to go into the Cloud Forest and the domes, but we just walked around. I did find it a bit confusing, and we probably missed lots of things, as we just couldn't find them!! Unfortunately they were trimming all the topiary when we got there, so couldn't get good pics. Just loved the atmosphere and went home with lots of souvenirs. Great day.",,
,,"Amazing, well worth a visit",5,,"We were lucky enough to visit when it was the spring blossom it was absolutely beautiful, in the flower dome, the cloud dome was amazing with waterfalls & walkways at different levels & heights, the collection of plants flowers was unbelievable. We particularly liked the skywalk from the super trees, the views are amazing too, the whole place is absolutely immaculate. It is lovely to see the super trees @ night part of the light show @ the marina bay hotel with the lazers.",,
,,Cloud Forest unique,5,,Great place for 2 hours then outside for evening light show . This relatively new attraction is really unique. Go early evening then go outside for the garden light and music show !,,
,,Fantastic day out!,5,,"The Gardens by the Bay are a great way to spend a few hours. Lovely to just wander around and see different plants and flowers, as well as the Supertree Grove. Would also recommend visiting the Floral Fantasy and Flower Dome, and the Supertree Grove skywalk for great views.",,
,,Beautiful and vast garden,5,,Literally by the bay this is a vast garden with multiple sections & statues. Good for a leisure walk with different trails. Hosts the tall man made trees. The garden is free to enter but has entry fees for various conservatories and the supertree skywalk which you can find deals for online,,
,,Amazing gardens (but way too many selfie stick people),4,,"A real highlight of our 3-day Singapore stopover, even for the 13-yr-old. Cactus gardens and baobab-type trees are amazing. The whole complex is a real feat of engineering and nature. Only downside is crowdedness with people who seem much more interested in selfies (and dangerous selfie sticks) than plants.",,
,,Singapore highlight!,4,,Amazing experience well worth the visit. The grounds are fantastic with multiple themed gardens featuring flora from around the world. The cloud greenhouse is even better. Don't leave Singapore without seeing it!,,
,,Magical Piece of Art,5,,"Its great how they had the whole thing build up from plants and trees and flowers and the cloud forest was even more magical, sky brigde is a must , amazing photo views.",,
,,AMAZING a must do...,5,,"The Gardens by the Bay speak for themselves, if you鈥檙e visiting Singapore they are a must do. I recommend going around 4PM onwards and staying until it鈥檚 dark! The light show is amazing and the view of Marina Bay Sands lit up is unbelievable. The park is really big and you can quite easily get lost in it, there is plenty of walking involved. I believe there is transport around if you need it. The cloud gardens were my favourite part, it鈥檚 gob smacking what they have done in there! Get yourself to the Gardens and enjoy them!",,
,,Beautiful,5,,Definitely an instagramable place..The flowers are all so pretty and the trees are awesome.. Indochine is very nice up there for drinks and chill... Every now and then the flowers are changed.. You have to keep going and you do not know what is in for you. Check them out. You won't regret!,,
,,"Interesting, educational, beautiful & spectacular.",5,,Loved our 2 visits. The first by day to enjoy the gardens and the 2nd to see the lights. Both are well worth it. Lots to see and smell and not as expensive as you might think.,,
,,Family Fun!,5,,We have been to the Gardens a few times which is amazing and a must do when coming to Singapore. This was our first time to the children water play area and playground. It is a great place to take the children after there patience at the flower domes!,,
,,Beautiful,4,,We saw this first from the Singapore Flyer. A beautiful building in the Marina. About $20 to get in bit the exhibit's change.,,
,,Nice garden but crowded with tour groups.,3,,We had limited time so we took the trolley tour. It gives you a good overview of the garden but you need to go on foot to look at things that interest you and to see details.,,
,,Flower tomb and the cloud garden - Day & Night view,4,,Make a visit to this place in such a way that you get to see the flower tomb and cloud forest during the day as well as the night. At 1945 HRS there is a laser show which should not be missed.,,
,,Interesting visit made less perfect with Disney Toy Story and Supertrees show,4,,"My first time to see the inside of the two iconic buildings. Certainly a sight to behold of the tremendous work done to bring all sorts of plants and botanical beauties into Singapore. A rare chance to see cacti blooming etc.
What made my trip less perfect was the wait for the first night lighting of the famous supertrees. By themselves, they are majestic.
Unfortunately, perhaps some clever fella decided to work with Disney Toy Story 4 to combine some Woody character and Buzz Light Year into the lighting show. Some poorly design quality screens disguised as floating clouds frame the show. Woody and friends are seen hopping from one screen to another. No sense of design, choreography or any outstanding wow moments. It is definitely a poor combination of forced marketing and also venue desperation to try to brand further.
In this case, both brands suffered. They should have stayed as separate entities and strengthen their own brands than to allow each other to be diluted due to poor performance of one.",,
,,So beautiful,5,,The Gardens by the Bay is gorgeous.... Go day and night. The flowers and waterfall were beautiful. And the air conditioning was a treat.,,
,,Very nice garden and show,5,,"Love the garden, and both flower dome and cloud forest dome. Spent around 1 1/2 hour in flower dome and close to 3 hours in forest dome. Watched the beautiful light show in the grass area of the food court by Skytree.",,
,,Kitschy to the extreme,2,,"We visited both the ""Flower Dome"" and ""Cloud Forest"" because everyone told us to do so. Overall it was somewhere between ridiculous and embarrassing. The ""Flower Dome"" is a pseudo French rose garden with complete with plastic puttos and paper machee ruins. The roses are way to densly planted in tropical style. The ""Cloud Forest"" treats the unsuspecting visitor to an elevator ride to the top of a concrete construction, where they can then walk down between ferns, orchids, and LED lighting. In all fairness, some people seemed to love it, but my partner and I much preferred the more natural Botanic Garden. Btw... it was a bit expensive.",,
,,Membership renewal,4,,"We took advantage of the half price membership renewal during June. Very good value at $90 for a one year membership for the entire family. Gets a bit repetitive after a while, but still has enough variety to keep the kids interested enough.",,
,,Beautiful!,5,,"Cloud Forest was absolutely breathtaking! You truly feel like you are in a cloud. There are many different levels that you can experience.
The Flower Dome had all different flowers separated by countries, continents, types, etc. It was amazing to see how many different plants grew inside both gardens. Definitely worth checking out in Singapore.",,
,,Lovely place,5,,The whole area is very well Planned. The two domes.. Flower and clouds are a great place to visit but on payment. It's worth it. The amazing arrangement and line up of all the trees and drift wood sculpture are nice. The light show at the garden is absolutely mesmerizing. Its a must watch.,,
,,Gardens!,3,,"Went to this venue due to all the hype. Well unless you are interested in plants & trees there is nothing more to do.
I visited early morning so the crowds were not an issue. But after 30 mins it became more of the same, same. This place is a back drop for the selfie brigade.
I wanted to do the skywalk but unfortunately it was closed for maintenance.
The structure itself is quite impressive and the light show is when this attraction comes into itself.
Singapore Botanic Gardens was a better option in my opinion.",,
,,Great constructions,4,,Visited both gardens. Cloud forest better. Amazing buildings almost more exciting than the plants. Worth a visit. Then through the free gardens outside. The super grove trees are fantastic. Arrange to be under or near them at 7.45 pm to see the light show every night. Then quickly head over to marina bay in front of shopping centre for the 8 pm or 9 pm light show.,,
,,back to nature in the concrete,5,,t is always wonderful to connect back to nature and this place gives you the peace you are searching for. You get to experience different kind of floral and faunas from different world in one place! It is amazing to see the city skyscraper when i was on the OCBC skywalk!,,
,,Gorgeous!,4,,"I visited both the Flower and Water Dome. Between the two, my favorite was the Water Dome with its cascading waterfall, exotic plants and gorgeous orchids. The Flower Dome was full of the plants that I already have at home like succulents and roses so it wasn't as impressive as the Water Dome. Both Domes are beautifully landscaped and lovely to stroll around, however the Flower Dome seemed a lot more crowded with all the scrollers. The entrance cost is around 22 USD.

Tip: Buy the ticket to the shuttle that gets you to the entrance of the Domes through the Gardens of the Bay - definitely worth the 2.25 USD if you get tired and just want a ride back. Singapore residents get a significant discount.",,
,,Full day here,5,,I spent a full day here touring around this massive campus and it is absolutely amazing. What a marvelous piece of Singapore for the public to experience.,,
,,Your getaway from the everyday.,5,,"Expect to be doing a lot of walking. Go up to the elevated walkway at Supertree Grove (S$8), munch at the ""Satay By The Bay"" Food Center, and enjoy the Sea Breeze at the Marina Barrage.",,
,,A must do,5,,Thoroughly enjoyed our visit here. Went late afternoon and stayed for the light show. The domes are brilliant. The lights were magical. Put this on your list of must dos in Singapore,,
,,Very well distributed with the flowers and the sculptures,5,,"The whole place is practically airconditioned, the flowers from all over the world + cacti were displaced. The waterfall was so refreshing, make you one to have a shower. I enjoyed the display tremendously and will not hesitate to visit this again.",,
,,Beautiful Gardens,5,,Visit gardens by the bay can also do this on a free bus tour from Changi airport if you get to Changi early and have time visit the info area at terminal one where the free tour can be accessed and ask if the tour operators are visiting the gardens by the bay that day or early evening is even better.The tour usually takes about 3 hrs in total a must do if you have the time and better than sitting in the airport for long periods.,,
,,Amazing Gardens,4,,"First time to visit Singapore and of course you must visit the gardens by the bay, just amazing place",,
,,Wonderful,5,,Beautiful gardens and the indoor waterfall was spectacular. We also did the Gardens by night which was equally amazing.,,
,,Wall through the gardens,5,,"We spent the day walking through the various gardens and taking in the scenery.

Our kids enjoyed the different gardens and there was a children鈥檚 festival which the added to the fun.

We did not do any of the paid activities such as the Cloud Garden.

There are various vendors selling refreshments which is handy on a hot day as was the case during our visit. It was also school holidays which added to the crowds",,
,,Amazing Singapore,5,,"Wow!! What I am gonna say? I love Singapore. Super clean, modern, beautiful, amazing, plus expensive 馃槀 Gardens by the Bay was a nice place to sit and chill enjoying the evening in Singapore. You can see Marina from there as well.",,
,,What an amazing place,5,,"Well worth the trip from the city, fantasic and lush. I really likes the street food area at the end og the gardens.",,
,,Love this place,5,,I have been here many times when visiting Singapore. My favourite thing is the Garden Rhapsody- it is fabulous. Singapore just does everything so well. This is a free event and is suitable for the whole family. It is an easy walk from the marina area. A must do.,,
,,Magnificent,5,,Did a tour around the gardens and then stayed for the light display. Absolutely brilliant and a must do event.,,
,,Amazing!,5,,"Gardens by the bay, how awesome is this place!!! This place exceeded my expectations (I was reluctant) to go in the first place. The 3D ride is brilliant along with everything else. A must do in Singapore!",,
,,One of the best to visit,5,,"Although I visited by a tourist tour, I'd rather go myself and spend a whole day. Its beautiful and lots to see and enjoy. Touristy gives only limited time",,
,,The beautifull garden,5,,"This garden is beautifull in SG. Ocbc skyway, flower dome and forest cloud. Outdoor area is very nice to your destination.",,
,,Great garden with fun experience,4,,We visited both Dome (Flower Dome and Cloud Forest). My teenager boys liked both of them. It was better than we expected. We purchased separate tickets to skywalk in the evening. The view was fantastic. You should plan for 3+ hours for both dome and skywalk.,,
,,A must see every time I visit Singapore.,5,,My 2 13-year-old grandchildren and seven-year-old and a four-year-old all love it as do I and my wife. It is a unique experience not duplicate or anywhere else in the western world that I am aware of. Everyone loves it.,,
,,spectacular credit to the Singapore Government,5,,"At the time of our visit, tulips were the main display theme. As usual both Domes were spectacular. If palnning to visit on the weekend best to pre book your ticket so that you don't stand in a long queue.",,
,,Beautiful landscape,5,,"Huge garden, colorful and everything was so intense (in a good way) to see. Easily reached by MRT, kids friendly. There was a cafe there and the food was nice. If you're looking for a gift, there's also a gift shop. And the flower shop.. oh my, I didn't wanna go home!

Just beautiful.",,
,,Thrice but still not done exploring the place,5,,"If u love greens, this is the plc to be. U can choose from staring at the waters to having a good run ard in the bay itself
Its packed during the school holidays as they hav events n festival but they can be quite quiet on off peak season where u can actually enjoy a good stroll or jus stare your boredom away here.
Accessible by mrt too (bayfront) and a underpass/linkway bridge to and fro mbs
This plc is HUGE so try putting on comfy footwear or u might need to walk barefooted if u choose to be fancy dancy trying to explore in heels. Not that u cant but well .. #justsaying",,
,,Amazing place to visit,5,,What a place to visit and for free! Beautiful gardens with some amazing views at times. The SuperTree Grove is a highlight both in the daytime and then come back at night to see the light and music show. Definitely worth it and like nothing I have ever seen before!,,
,,Perhaps the best garden in South East Asia,5,,"Good place to bring families or go for a romantic walk. The free of charge outdoor area is already plenty, and beautiful. The paid areas, the domes, are fantastic. You鈥檒l get to see lots of plants and more importantly, the atmosphere inside is very calming.

Avoid weekends.",,
,,One of its Kind !!!,5,,"A superb place ... must go place in Singapore. You will fall in love with this Gardens. 2 Domes, OBCB Skywalk, Light & Sound Show, etc.",,
,,Nice walk and nature,4,,"In a very sunny day is a very nice place to visit. You don't need to pay to enter most of the attractions. There are some fast food places around, and there are plenty of activities for families with children. Is easy to find yourself lost in nature, even though you are actually in the middle of the city. Not recomended for rainy days",,
,,Beautiful garden in Singapore,5,,"Garden by the way is easy to access with the MRT and its location is close to Marina bay. From outside garden by the bay, we can found free gardens with any decoration, so the visitors can do photos there for free. If you want to enter the garden by the way you have to buy a ticket, but the price is appropriate with the various types of flowers and decorations that we will meet. Visiting this place is great for increasing our knowledge.",,
,,A must do in Singapore,5,,"We bought ticket for the 2 domes, flower dome and cloud forest. The flower dome is just amazing. So many different kinds of flowers and some which we have never seen before, together with the beautiful landscaping, you can spend hours there. You sure don't want to miss the waterfall and the rainforest in the cloud forest dome. Too bad it is raining on the day we went there, so we didn't get a chance to walk around the outdoor garden and the big trees there. Have to go again next time !",,
,,Children's Festival,4,,"Toy Story 4 themed activities for younger children in a lovely setting.
Very hot and humid. We were so pleased we visited early at 10am opening time. No waiting for activities which were appropriate for toddlers and children up 5 I think. A bit young for my accompanying 6 year old, although she enjoyed collecting all the activity stamps and earning the stickers.
Well laid out and organised.",,
,,Very beautiful view,5,,amazing and beautiful scenes and different botanical and lovely beautiful flowers. it is nicely maintain only drawback is very limited time so heavy rush always dher. Nice for photo clicking and spending 2 hrs,,
,,Amazing,5,,Well worth a visit. We had lunch in the Super Tree. Great views and good food. The trees are fasanating and at night when lit up are awesome. Thoroughly recommend the light show to music in the evening.,,
,,nice scenery and perfect place,5,,came to singapore and enjoy and was introduced to go garden by the bay as their main attraction. This place is awesome and perfect and we took tons of photo. The flower domes and scenery during evening time is the unforgettable moment.,,

,,Fabulous place to spend half a day,5,,"Absolutely amazing with its 2 domes and gorgeous surrounding gardens, visually a complete feast for the eyes and senses and the evening sound and light show finished off our visit with a wow!",,
,,Garden adventure,5,,"Visited this venue in June 2019. An awesome exhibit - Both the rain forest and the garden exhibits were breath taking. Though, we did not have any children, there was a 鈥榯hemed鈥?area for younger children to play. We only spent the morning at the gardens, but you could spend all day walking through the park or relaxing by the lakes. An enjoyable visit.",,
,,Fun family day out!,4,,Family friendly. It was nice to have a day out with family at the beautiful garden. Children really enjoyed the children carnival.,,
,,"Beautiful, Beautiful Gardens by the Bay",5,,"Returning to Australia from the UK we had a three night stopover just to visit the gardens. A fantastic achievement, especially when you see they have transplanted Boab trees and 1000 year old Olive Trees in the domes. The rose display was beautiful and the various sculptures throughout were very interesting. Just loved the external sculptured trees (hiding the flues which vent the heat from the domes) and the dragonfly lake. Only negative would be that more directional signage is needed to get to the Floral Fantasy (special exhibition) but once there the display was terrific.",,
,,I died and went to floral heaven!,5,,"The latest attraction called Floral Fantasy was so sublimely beautiful, it felt like a paradise. Flowers beyond imagination cascading from ceilings and walls, colors to amaze and delight, and fragrance wafting throughout. The popular attractions of Flower Dome and Cloud Forest (both undercover) are architectural and horticultural masterpieces. Take several hours to wander through these three, and that's before you even head out to the many acres of outdoor gardens. This is totally and absolutely unmissable for any lovers of beauty and growing plants.",,
,,Must See for every Garden Lover,5,,"Majestic designs, picture perfect landscaping, spacious with over 250,000 plants from around the Globe.",,
,,Floral Fantasy,3,,The power points at the attraction spoilt the overall photo - should be covered or hidden behind some plants.,,
,,2 Conservatories,5,,Visited Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. Both are good. Spent more time in Flower Dome as there are many gardens to explore. There are many types of flowers in bright colours. Very nice to take photos there. The indoor waterfall in CF is great too. The place was veiled with mist while we were walking down cloud walk. It was a great experience visiting the 2 conservatories. We were glad that we waited for the light show at Supertree Grove. Toy Story 4 theme was amazing!,,
,,Benefits for members / friends of Garden by the Bay,4,,"Garden by the bay to provide free tram ride for ""members / friends"" of Garden by the Bay and Seniors citizens of Singapore.",,
,,Flower dome,5,,"Very excellent flower arrangements and lots different types flowers pleasing the eyes, planning o revisit tf the time permits.",,
,,Spectacular in the flesh!,5,,"Photos do not do this amazing sight justice! You must go in person and it is freeto walk around. The sky walk is paid but also very worthwhile! A day and night visit is a must! This sight is a global icon equivalent to the Eiffel Tower, Statue of Liberty and should be put on every bucket list!",,
,,Excellent visit!,5,,It was my first visit as a Singaporean. It was an amazing experience. Suitable for everyone. Is a relaxing and eye catching experience. Lots to see. I love flowers so good one for me. I will definitely go back again.,,
,,Floral Fantasy,5,,"Kind of like stepping into some Lilliputian garden. It鈥檚 a feast for the ideas. Ideal for the really little ones.
Of delightful surprise was the poison dart frog exhibit.
There are two stationary seats on the 4D ride. Really small ones aren鈥檛 allowed on the living seats even if sitting with parent. It鈥檚 interesting and entertains the little ones, with real bubbles floating downwards at some point. For adults, it鈥檚 probably a bit gimmicky. Once you finish the 4D show, you have to exit the premises. We weren鈥檛 told this so we couldn鈥檛 go back to look at the exhibits again.",,
,,Good place,4,,Good place which is very well constructed and well maintained. The waterfall is also awesome and so are the plants,,
,,Very pretty at night,5,,"Don鈥檛 bother paying to walk around the skywalk. You can see the SuperTrees from the ground just as well.
The gardens are extremely well kept.
There is a McDonald鈥檚 in the middle, although ice cream prices are more expensive than in the rest of Singapore.
The park is lovely to wonder around for an hour or so. You also get a great view of the Marina Bay Sands Resort.",,
,,Must see in Singapore,5,,This is the main attraction in Singapore.The metal trees are so tall and its just a very different attraction to anywhere else. The light show later on a night is worth watching. You need to buy tickets for the flower dome and waterfall dome and also the walkway that sits high up between the metal flowers.,,
,,Best attraction in Singapore,5,,"We regularly take guests around Singapore and this place consistently gets the best reviews and reaction. If you only do one thing - go here. The kids area is superb, it has something for everyone and Satay By The Bay is next door and is a great outdoor Hawker market to have roti Prada and dumplings. The Glasshouse鈥檚 are worth the ticket!!! Everything else is free.",,
,,Garden lovers dream,5,,"A visit to Singapore on return from Europe for one reason - to visit the Gardens by the Bay...bucket list item. A WOW factor visit - night tour so exciting with the spectacular lights, day visit to enjoy the walks/audio tour to see the heart of the gardens and hear the stories of its features and how amazing the Flower Dome with the rose display..and it's air conditioned...a real winner. Such creative and awesome exhibits and photographic moments. Everything and more than I had expected.",,
,,Flower Dome n cloud forest,3,,Too many people. Too far from home. Why cannot bring back the flowers? Photographer cheat money want sell the pictures so expensive.,,
,,Awesome! Breathtaking! A trip that one shouldnt miss!,5,,The flowers are so beautiful and special. It is just so nice to watch. The fountain is fabulous. The walk from from the top is so amazing. Both conservatories are just so unique on its own. The garden outside is equally nice. A must come!,,
,,Deceleration of flowers and various plants,4,,The deceleration of various flowers and plants are very presentable. I and my family love it. Will revisit against.,,
,,Beautiful,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is a huge nature park
It's divided into various categories.
The cloud forest, flower dome and the super tree grove.
As you enter, you will be greeted by pleasant floral fragrance, courtesy of the many flowers and plants grown here.
The most notable highlight is the Supertree Grove. They are so pretty and you can't miss the light show in the evening. These trees are lit up and they look prettier.
However, the cloud forest is my favourite.
As you enter the Cloud Forest, you will be transported to a mysterious world veiled in the mist. The breath-taking mountain view surrounded by diverse vegetation, beautiful flowers and that magnificent waterfall. The skywalks are Beautifully constructed. It will leave you awe struck.
This is truly a man made wonder.
Do not miss it.",,
,,Best garden experience,5,,"The flower dome is having a ""rose"" themed garden when we visit it in Jun 2019. The roses are beautiful. Smell really nice too. Other part of the garden are well maintained too.

The cloud dome is nice. There is a part whereby you can be near to the top of the water fall. We can see the metal whereby the water falls. If that part can be hidden with plants, it will give a better overall experience.

You can visit during day time and still feel cool as both domes are air conditioned.

Best garden experience we ever have. Thumb up!",,
,,Beautiful!,5,,You shouldn't be missing this place during your visit to Singapore. It's a marvel. Kids would love it.,,
,,My Family Love it 鈽?鈾?鈽?鈾?5.0,,"a very exciting experience since its my familys first time to visit the place and its really amazing, wonderful and my Family really love it 鈽?鈾?鈽?鈾?鈽?
,,Beautifully landscaped gardens with good walking trails,5.0,,Beautifully landscaped gardens with good walking trails ... but watch out for the cyclists and e-scooters that zip along (way too fast!) amongst pedestrians 鈥?there need to be stricter rules about speed and mode of transportation around the gardens and trails.
,,Exploring lots of nature plants"," love their flower theme""",,
,,Favourite place in Sinagpore,5,,"I cannot speak highly enough of the Gardens by the Bay, my girlfriend and I spent hours both visiting the famous domes and generally exploring the Gardens. There is so much to discover and I adored every part of it.",,
,,Great for the garden lover and with bonus aircon!,5,,We were expecting this to be a hot and muggy experience but were overjoyed when we walked inside to lovely climate controlled environment. We had a lovely stroll around for a couple of hours in the flower garden and the cloud dome both of which we busy with selfie loving photo snappers! We were able to but tickets online and skip the line and just use our phone to scan on the way in.,,
,,Spectacular place to spend a day,5,,"There is so much to see and do here. Easy to get to, and then just explore all day long. Beautiful gardens, play areas, eateries. Must not be missed if you are visiting Singapore.",,
,,"Gardens by the Bay, Singapore",5,,"Visit to Gardens by the Bay at Singapore is an lovely experience .. and one should never miss ..
It鈥檚 largest green houses of glass .. one is flower dome n other cloud forest .. Enjoyed extreme closeness of flowers n fauna .. totally different n unbelievable variety of exotic flowers with so much different colours, shades, shapes n fragrance .. it has diverse species of plants from world over .. very neatly preserved n maintained .. vertical plant display on Skyway tower is amazing .. plenty greenery, Garden & Water is pleasant .. audio guide facility & equipment provided to visitors needs improvement .. Good dining facilities for vegetarian are not sufficient and existing needs improvement ..Visit must ..",,
,,Beautiful spot,5,,"If you want to se the wonders of nature, this is the place. Amazing place to recharge the batteries in an environment full of beauty. Very crowded though but well worth a visit.",,
,,Winetasting in Singapore,5,,WOW can鈥檛 say anything else just like the rest of Singapore a must to see very well thought about and looked after....,,
,,Evening Experience with Great Value,4,,The evening light show is a great diversion when in Singapore. Imagine the Disney Light Parade with better music... Its a bit of a zoo getting in and out but the quality of the show won't change too much if you arrive late...but you may be more comfortable if you arrive a little bit earlier and grab a towel or two from your hotel to sit on... Recommendation: It may be even better if you sneak in a bottle and glasses...,,
,,Amazing place.,5,,We visited here during our stay in Singapore. The gardens are huge. There are several large lakes with fountains etc. The gardens are well kept and spotless. There is an area called the cloud forest but it was closed at the time. There are 2 light and sound shows in the gardens during the evening. One at 7.45 pm and the other an hour later. Well worth seeing . It is a big tourist attraction with thousands of people there. superb.,,
,,A must visit on trip to Singapore,5,,"Didnt get a chance to go in the domes, but the night view from the gardens & within the garden was mesmerizing. Witnessed just last 1 min of light & sound show but even that was an amazing experience. Gardens are huge and one can spend an entire day here if they visit with kids. So many things for kids to do and see. If you going to singapore, visit this around 3/4 pm so that by the time you finish both domes, lights come on and you have one hell of view. Singapore flyer/ marina bay sands both visible. If possible, walk down helix bridge at night, will add to your experience.",,
,,Awesome Place to visit,5,,Its a wonder!! nobody would realize what it has to offer unless s/he enters the dome. the collection of so many species of plants and organizing them in such a masterly style can not but appreciated. Its a modern wonder. Kids enjoyed a lot. A MUST visit place in Singapore.,,
,,Great day.,4,,We spent an entire day here and it was wonderful. I loved all the attractions except for the flower dome. I thought the flower dome was a bit tacky and the flowers were not as well looked after. The cloud forest was really cool and the floral fantasy was beautiful. The super trees are spectacular and the outside gardens and sculptures are interesting. I wish there were a few more food options there.,,
,,A wonderful place for tourist attraction,5,,Garden by the bay is a wonderful place for tourist attraction in Singapore . It is full of unique plants and in the evening there was a beautiful light and sound show,,
,,Simply stunning!,5,,"A perfect way to spend the day. So much beauty, interesting architectural designs, water, flowers and trees. A must if you're visiting Singapore.",,
,,Spectacular,5,,"Definitely worth a visit, do the domes during the day, the flower dome is beautiful gardens all laid out in fully covered airconditioned domes, lots of unique sculptures & plants. The cloud dome is a spectacular waterfall & canopy walkway with a fantastic feat of engineering & nature coming together to produce this marvel, see if you can spot all the dragons.
The super trees are best visited at night for the mind blowing light & sound show, I鈥檝e never seen anything like it!",,
,,giant artificial supertrees,4,,"try visiting this attraction at night and be mesmerized by its magical light show. never mind the beads of sweat trickling down your face because of humidity. you'll just be transfixed in awe while viewing the interchange of colors with corresponding upbeat music.

coming here is free. be prepared with your camera and a lot of smiles.",,
,,Better at night,4,,"Very well laid out, plenty to see but worth going back at night. Easy to get to either by taxi or within walking distance from the marina.",,
,,A mesmerizing experience,5,,"Just amazing. The greenery, planned landscape, the enormous trees that look beautiful more in the day than the night with all the glitter and light says it all. Overall the experience is mesmerizing",,
,,MUST DO!,5,,"This place is spectacular. If you're into gardens, or can appreciate a good garden, this is the place to go.

We started with Flower Dome and then went to Cloud Forest after. I feel like this is the way to do it as the wow factor in the Cloud Forest is next level.

Out of all the sectioned gardens, the succulent garden is absolutely amazing. All the plants are curated to perfection. We were also lucky enough to see their rose installation (which goes through to mid July). While it was impressive, there were a lot of the same rose about. I wished there were some more varieties, however that is a very small gripe as the amount of roses in there is phenomenal.

Having no expectations, I was amazed by Cloud Forest, just as I was the Flower Dome. It was such a nice surprise to see it all laid out. Leave yourself an hour our two to cover both the CF and FD.

We also had lunch in the Flower Dome. It was great, but portions are small and it is very expensive. So leave yourself enough money for that.",,
,,A Must Visit,5,,"Really cool gardens, the place is stunning at night with the lights on. It's an iconic part of Singapore, you must check it out!",,
,,Visit to Garden by the Bay,5,,The place is huge with a lot greenery. There are tree shaped like structures with orchids and other plants around them . There are some sky walks. There also a solarium with plants. We didn鈥檛 have time to go in due to limited time.,,
,,Fantastic Tourist Attraction,5,,The Flower Dome and Cloud Forest were amazing. Had a fantastic time at the Gardens By The Bay and the light show at the Super Tree grove was spectacular. It is worth the money.,,
,,Most beautiful and sceneric place in Singapore.,5,,"Garden by the bay is the most beautiful place ,its like we feel that we are on green planet all around .It consist of cloud forest where you feel like you walk across the clouds when mist is there and Flower dome where you are around so many beautiful flowers that you can feel the flora and beauty.",,
,,A Large Green Area Nearby the Bay in Singapore,4,,"It is a huge green area constitutes with different gardens nearby the bay area in Singapore. Especially, two gardens developed as large green houses called ""flower dome"" and ""cloud forest"" are very interesting. If you like natural beauties and want to increase your awareness about the climate change, please go and visit the Gardens. For those gardens, you need to buy a ticket. What amazed me is, despite of air condition in the green houses area, how they could manage to keep those trees and vegetation alive.",,
,,Worth a Visit,4,,"We spent a couple of hours in the Gardens by the Bay, having some lunch and a walk through the gardens which are beautifully kept and interesting.",,
,,Will be my must see recommendation for friends going to Singapore,5,,Will be my must see recommendation for friends going to Singapore. Visually stunning and educational. Simply had a great experience.,,
,,Great Experience,5,,Had so much fun here with the kids. It was super busy with the start of the Toy Story theme but well worth the visit. Well done to all creators. We also visited the Cloud Forrest. The kids enjoyed all aspects of their visit and learnt a lot about sustainability in today's world. Thanks Singapore.,,
,,Interesting but LOTS of walking,3,,"The Supertree Grove was closed due to weather. I鈥檓 not sure that attraction is worth the money. If you buy a ticket and they close, there are no refunds. Two different places to buy tickets with typically poor directional signage. Cloud Forest interesting, but a huge amount of walking. Using a wheelchair possible and the rental was super cheap but the pathways are not continuous so you end up on and off multiple elevators. Flower Dome was so-so, with some interesting trees. Not worth the fee. Some specimens have the plant name but almost nothing else.",,
,,Great light and sound show every night,4,,"Loved watching these giant structures (built to catch rainwater, which is then purified and used as Singapore's drinking water) decorated for both daytime (climbing plants) and nighttime (light and sound show) tourism. However, Singapore, please get a new soundtrack for the show. 1970s disco??? Really?",,
,,"Very busy, interesting flora",3,,"Not a cheap excursion, we took a joint ticket to visit the Flower Dome and the Cloud Dome. I found the cloud dome disappointing, there is no cloud for a start. Just a lot of green plants growing around a central concrete structure.
There is a walkway which is entitled the lost world, poor choice of description given the association with the movie. Its just a high walkway to look down on the plants.
The flower dome was much better with the dome divided into different world regions.
Overall I was disappointed in both, thought is was going to be considerably better than it was",,
,,A man made paradise that looks more natural,5,,"An ideal place for a nature lover, an overdose of greenery, it seems that thousands of gardens gathered at one place. I visited there during Summer flower festival and I found myself that I have seen all the flowers of the world in a single day.",,
,,Super cool place,5,,Better to visit during the day but so that you finished closer to 20.00 or 21.00 to see the watershow and at 19.45 the super trees show,,
,,Lovely,5,,"This is lovely to wander around and spend a few hours exploring. If you don鈥檛 want to go into the flower and forest covered garden areas, or the cloud walk, you can just wander around for free. All the areas are typically Singaporean - clean and beautifully presented.",,
,,Interesting but kind of touristy,4,,I probably would have given it 5 stars if we had not visited the Singapore Botanical garden prior. The gardens by the bay are beautiful buildings and the area is delightful to walk around but the actual exhibits are worth doing but not the top thing I would chose to do in Singapore.,,
,,Oasis in Singapore,5,,"A truly amazing attraction, which showcases Singapore's ingenuity in attracting tourists to such a small island nation with virtually no natural attractions. All the 3 big attractions - Cloud forest, Flower dome and Floral fantasy are paid, but well worth the money. The supertree grove holds a free light and sound show every evening which is worth watching too.",,
,,Mesmerizing and eye-popping!,5,,"The Cloud Forest and Flower Dome, in addition to the Super Trees Grove, were some of the most magnificent sites in Singapore!",,
,,Ok,3,,If you are a nature lover & has a good knowledge of plants & trees then only you should visit here otherwise boredome.,,
,,outing with overseas guests,5,,i brought some overseas guests to enjoy the garden and they were mesmerised and impressed by the entire concept. I feel proud to have shown them around.,,
,,Nice on a rainy afternoon,4,,"Exactly what it says on the tin, nice way to spend a rainy afternoon wandering around taking in the gardens. Bring a jumper the aircon can make it quite chilly.",,
,,A rainforest and gardens in the sky!,5,,"It was rainy when we went there but still managed to do the long cloudwalk since it's our last destination for the day.. An hour before dark, with the kids tired and sleepy, we enjoyed the view, great ambience, flowers in bloom, well maintined gardens.. Best to go there earlier if you wish to bring kids since it will be a long queuing.. Definitely will come back..",,
,,Selfie Heaven!,5,,Loved this place but laughed our heads off at all the tourists of two nationalities doing non stop selfies - sometimes you wonder if people go to see it or get the perfect picture. Put the camera down and enjoy the amazing experience.,,
,,Amazing!,5,,Highly recommended in a day of sightseeing along with the other nearby gardens. Such a beautiful garden with amazing views of Singapore.,,
,,"Wow, unreal!",5,,"Way, way better than I would have ever expected. Absolutely first-rate. A must-see when you come here. Super busy on weekends, come early and on a weekday for best experience.",,
,,Rating based on LIGHT SHOW,2,,This review is based on the night time light show. People and kids gather around each tree and lie down looking up for the kids light show. Made for young children's. Nothing special.,,
,,Nice and green place,5,,"We have been here twice. The 1st time, we didn鈥檛 know the walking way from Marina Bay Sand to the Garden By The Bay, so we took a taxi to the gate of the Garden. And we couldn鈥檛 enjoy much thing at that time
This time, we took the walking way from Marina Bay Sands, and enjoyed a great view to the super trees, Singapore Flyer during the time walking there. We passed the Dragonfly lake via a nice wooden bridge and reach to the super trees area. If you want to walk on the OCBC sky walk, ensure you arrive early to book the slot at the kiosk near the entrance. We missed the walking as the queuing line was too long. Let鈥檚 spend sometime to enjoy the Super trees light and music show at 7:45pm, really wonderful for both music and light performance.
Take the bus to Marina Bay Sands hotel bus station (03509) and take the elevator to the top floor, or you can take the MRT to the Bayfront MRT station. After the Super trees show, walk back to Marina Bay Sands to enjoy the water music show there. It should be enough for your evening.",,
,,Stunning gardens,5,,"The gardens are beautiful in its architecture and touches all your senses. We went early evening so that we could experience the effect of the lights as well. It was quite busy, but that did not dampen our experience. Defnitely recommended.",,
,,Amazing garden in a concrete city,5,,"I am very amazed by this concrete garden. We have visited the Flora Fantasy, $20 entree. Lots of fun in the 4D cinema. The flowers inside were amazing. Saw a light blue orchid, loved it.",,
,,This is a must and this may help,5,,"Firstly the gardens are beautiful by day and spectacular by night when the garden rhapsody show is on.
Gardens are open 5.00am to 2.00am daily,entry is free unless you want to go to either the skyway,flower dome or cloud forest all which open at 9.00am.

Garden rhapsody nightly at 7.45pm and 8.45pm , around 15 minutes in duration.
Summing up , arrive early for both great photos and less crowded at the cooled conservatories and skywalk.
RETURN FOR THE GARDEN RHAPSODY, A MUST.
Garden rhapsody is free , if you only time to do one thing this is it.",,
,,Multiple trips,5,,"Lovely place to wander in, remember your umbrella for the sun as it鈥檚 a large place to wander around. Easy access from the train station.",,
,,Our future can be saved!,5,,"This garden is very very huuuugeee. It will be beneficial to get a map and exploring the entire place is definitely worth it. There will be a lot of walking but you can also pay for shuttle to bring you around. In this place, you would appreciate how important nature takes part in the world and what we can still do to make this place beautiful. Do not settle on just going around the free areas. It's definitely worth exploring the Cloud Dome Forest. Me and my sister got really interested on how it was made and maintained. There's so much information to learn from that area alone. As a whole, I enjoyed this greenery place. Even though it is man-made, it shows how we can really do something build a better world to live in. (I actually thought that at the end of the world, the people in the Cloud Dome Forest will be the only one to survive! Hahaha)",,
,,Exceeded expectations,5,,"A 10 min walk from Marina Bay Sands. I was initially bit apprehensive about it. But as soon as you enter it will blow your mind. I mean it's so good and refreshing. Cloud forest is another highlight. Must spare atleast 2 hours to view this scintillating place. Great place to click photos.

At the end there's a lil restaurant serving light refreshments. Your trip to Singapore will be incomplete with visiting Gardens by the Bay.

Must visit!!",,
,,Must visit - Awesome green spaces right in the heart of the city,5,,"100 hectares of well laid out green spaces housing trees, and plants from all over the world, water bodies, pleasant walkways and arty sculptures. The Flower Dome maintains a spring time atmosphere with some semi permanent plants. The flowers being changed every few weeks. When we went, the theme was roses - diff types, colours and smells from all over the world. Very pretty to wander around. We also visited the Cloud Forest - another conservatory for tropical / rainforest vegetation and plants. Its cool and damp atmosphere is very fresh and pleasant. Its a wonderful opportunity to see nature from all over the world being well showcased and preserved. Hats off to this imitative by the govt and people of Singapore",,
,,Wonderful place,4,,This place is wonderful to visit and well worth it. You can see all kinds of plants from around the world. Well done Singapore!,,
,,Spectacular,5,,Wasn鈥檛 sure if my teenagers would enjoy this but the gardens are so amazing it鈥檚 difficult not to have a great time. This must be on Singapore to do list,,
,,Wow! Don't miss Gardens by the Bay,5,,"Easy to get to via Marina Bay Sands - a lift and a walkway. We were overwhelmed by the enormity and beauty of these gardens. Could stay all day there with the trolleys, the domes, the lakes, souvenir shop. Just wander around at leisure. We enjoyed a buffet lunch at Marina Bay Sands as well.",,
,,Fantabulously superb,5,,What a place.? No this is not in ironic sense. I am still lingering like what I have seen. Spell bound. Beauty and unparalleled imagination of a person. A beautiful garden where flowers are showcases and never imagined that cactus can be as beautiful as tulips. a man made forest with a grand waterfall where only the beauty is abundant. A place full of photographic locations. Not to be missed the light and sound show in the evening. A person to see must come in second half with around four to five hours of time to spend.,,
,,Fantastic,5,,Wonderful experience. Gardens By The Bay did not disappoint us. The Children's Garden was full of fun for my children. The Cloud Forrest and Flower Dome were beautiful. Satay By The Bay food was good. We had a great time. Will definitely recommend my friends and relatives to visit this place when they visit Singapore.,,
,,lovely little walk around. very beautiful,5,,"you pay for a ticket at the ticketing counter near the entrance. from memory, 28$ each for 2 enclosures.
both beautiful and veeeeery well kept, they must spend a lot of time looking after every plant.
wear comfy shoes as there is a lot to walk around. the cloud dome area is super cool (temp wise) as it's very air conditioned and has the big waterfall so go in there for a cool down.
would come back to show others, or if there was a different show to see.",,
,,Wow!,5,,Such an amazing experience. This place is so big and so many to see. Just get lost around and explore the area.,,
,,Good place to take photos,5,,"A great place to take photos with family and enjoy the flowers. Location is convenient. If you want to avoid crowd while taking photos, suggest going early and buying tickets online",,
,,Exceeded our expectations,5,,"We thought this would be good, though it was actually amazing. The Cloud Forest was so worth the token amount you pay to see this place. I highly recommend Gardens by the Bay, everything is done so well, as you come to realise this is the way Singaporeans do things.",,
,,Spectacular Indoor Arboretum,5,,"This is one place that you must see in Singapore. An indoor multi-level arboretum which is created with creative and careful planning. Not only the variety of plants you find here, but also the way they are arranged. An artistry of a very high standard. The ticket is not cheap ($28 per person), but it is worthwhile.",,
,,"Unreal, amazing experience",5,,"This was one of are highlights of Singapore.. the flower dome was amazing, and the supertree grove trees are excellent, especially for the light show, we did not get into see the cloud forest, the wait time was too long, we were on a tour with guide, so i cant comment, but i heard it amazing.. these gardens are a must when in Singapore",,
,,Skip the Flower Dome,4,,"The Cloud Forest is very interesting, but unless you are a generic flower nut, skip the Flower Dome.
The flowers were nice but it isn't awe-inspiring. We have a teenager (15 years old) and we were unimpressed with the Flower Dome. Also, we have terrible allergies and as soon as we stepped in we were congested and our eyes started watering.",,
,,"Peaceful, cool oasis in flower dome and cloud forest.",5,,"Popular, so would advise a morning visit if possible. The train ride is a good idea for orientation and overview, and not expensive. The two domes are climate c controlled, so a perfect escape from humidity. If you are a fan of orchids, the cloud forest is a must!",,
,,Garden by the bay,5,,Nice display of flowers and friendly service staff ! Need more covered walkways or shelters along way to floral fantasy area from the domes area during the day time. Very hot !,,
,,Absolutely Fabulous,5,,"Visited the Cloud Forest, Floral Dome and Skywalk. All of them absolutely stunning with the Cloud Forest being the best. In the evening when the lights are turned on skywalk has a show which must not be missed. A must visit place in singapore.",,
,,Floral Fantasy,5,,"Unlike other GBB attractions like Flower Dome & Cloud Forest, their latest attraction, Floral Fantasy, is much smaller & simpler but, a different concept from the other 2 attractions altogether.
Floral Fantasy was beautifully designed & has quite a few IG worthy scapes to take pictures, despite it's shorter tour which can be completed not more than an hour. To complement it's beautiful scaping, the 4D theatre could bring us to places we can never reach in GBB.
Last but not least, it was a good effort by GBB to allow hourly entrance into FF. This method has effectively controlled the crowd & thus, allowed us to take beautiful IG worthy pictures without much of a hassle!",,
,,Definitely worth the visit!,5,,"If you are an anthophile, you will love this place! A very beautiful place for you to take many pictures as well.",,
,,Always something new garden,5,,"Feast for the eyes - Cherry blossom , tulips , roses - always something fresh and new and well designed - beautiful . The floral fantasy is also A must visit",,
,,Love It!,5,,"Went to Floral Fantasy and everything was so pretty. The colours and all are great for photo taking. Even the 4D ride was fun, didnt know that I can actually smell flowers like this.",,
,,A truly Garden within a City,5,,A place that you must visit in Singapore if you are a tourist and also for locals. Gardens by the Bay have various flower themes all year round for all seasons and all places. It is a wonderful place to relax and enjoy the beautiful flowers and plants from all over the world in one location.,,
,,Cannot miss while you are in Singapore?,5,,"This is one of the best places to be a part of your itinerary if you are travelling to Singapore. It's a nature park which consists of three gardens. The Flower Dome and Cloud forest are awesome. Flower dome replicates a mild, dry climate and features plants found in the Mediterranean and other semi-arid tropical regions (e.g. parts of Australia, South America, South Africa). The Cloud Forest is higher but slightly smaller at 0.8 hectares (2.0 acres). It replicates the cool moist conditions found in tropical mountain regions between 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) and 3,000 metres (9,800 ft) above sea level, found in South-East Asia, Middle- and South America",,
,,an impressive floral world,5,,"The flowers are very beautiful and colorful. The art of combination of flowers, waterfall and music is wonderful. The view is wide and impressive. I will suggest my friends coming here.",,
,,Its Short but So Refreshing,5,,"I visit Singapore with my pregnant friend a few years ago. We visit Garden by The Bay because of technological advances can bring forests in the city. We are really satisfied to enjoy the atmosphere when we visit this place, this place is cool, comfortable, clean, beautiful and neat. wherever we see everything is shade green. So the summary is, this place is awesome! You can visit this place by MRT: for the cheapest transportation.",,
,,Enchanting,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is quite expansive as a whole (the entirety covers 101 hectares) making budgeting time difficult. I recommend visiting the main attractions which are the two conservatories (Cloud Forest and Flower Dome) and the Supertree Grove.

The Cloud Forest and Flower Dome both require an admission which can be purchased as a package of the two for $28 ($20 for Singapore residents).

The Flower Dome is an extensive display of floral growth from regions around the world, which in turn are subdivided into 8 separate gardens. The majority of the species in the flower dome are endemic only to limited areas.

The Cloud Forest is a replica of the tropical and subtropical mountainous forests that experience frequent cloud cover. Inside the mountain, there are exhibits on endangered species and climate change along with the cloud and treetop walks.

Supertree Grove is an assortment of treelike structures and the OCBC skyway gives a great view of the garden as a whole and the area.

I highly recommend visiting the conservatories and Supertree Grove if you are short on time as it is less time consuming than strolling through the entirety of the park and is fascinating.",,
,,FANTASTIC SITE FOR GARDEN LOVERS,4,,If you love gardens this is a must see. I think we paid 28 dollars for both domes. Try and go late when all the tourist have left. This way you can actually enjoy it with out people yelling and sitting on every flat surface or shoving in front of you to take pictures.,,
,,Unforgettable,5,,"This is a MUST if you are in Singapore, the trees were amazing, the gardens as well but the gardens with waterfalls were unforgettable, great attraction and great service!! Go if you have 2 hours or so...",,
,,Fantastic,5,,Totally worth the visit for so many reasons - the gardens are spectacular and seem to refresh you in the humid environment! The light show at night is also amazing!,,
,,Great light show,5,,We watched the evening music and light show at the gardens. It was very fun and recommend as it is a free event!,,
,,Beautiful lush gardens,5,,"My family enjoyed our time at these gardens. The pathways are lush with trees and plants as well as water features throughout. The two domes were the highlight for us, especially Cloud Forest with its indoor mountain and water falls. We came back later to view the light show which right now has a Toy Story theme. We didn't find that show so interesting, but I'm guessing it was fun for younger children. We do plan to go back to see the other water and laser show they have.",,
,,Excellent Place!,5,,"Its a must visit place.
Be careful to avoid Weekends to avoid rush.
Its a family destination / attraction.
The entry to the park and most attractions inside (scenic beauty) is free.
there are two domes ...one is a Rose Garden equivalent and second is tropical forest equivalent. Both are a treat in itself.
However, i cant comment much about these two as i avoided going inside as it was already a long day and i had other commitments.
Subsequently there is a wonderful lights and sound show.
There are 2 shows ...one each scheduled at 8 & 9 pm ....Both for 15 mins. Worth a watch.
There is a sky walk at the attraction for which you pay about $8 per person. This can be avoided if you are going to MBS Skypark.
It can be avoided otherwise also.
Please do not plan to see the Light and Sound show if you choose to go to the Skywalk....you will miss the entirity of the show. It looks best from the ground.
Lastly there is a restaurant at the top....If you are a couple...can plan for a dinner date here. But Indians ....be ware of the menu...it has limited options which most Indians may or amy not like !",,
,,Man made Gardens can be awesome,4,,"Gardens by the Bay is one of the must visit stops if you come to Singapore.
Another Singapore iconic attraction, Marina Bay Sands, is within walking distance. Both can be covered in one day.

This man made gardens had many critics when it first opened but is now proving to be a major draw.

Major components are Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest. Both charged fees fir admission. Admission to the outdoor gardens and children's garden is free.

The centre piece has to be the Flower Dome,home to the world's largest glass greenhouse. Visitors and residents get to enjoy flowers from all parts of the world in one place.Floral displays change periodically with seasonal themes.",,
,,Absolutely Stunning Must See!,5,,"If there is an 8th wonder of the world, this could be it! These gardens are absolutely stunning, have been well thought out and there are so many little surprises hiding, such as statues, international gardens, wooden animal sculptures, themed areas and a Childrens water play area. You can hire a small cart to tour the park if you dont want to walk in the heat. Inside the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest are not to be missed. We plan to visit both again any time we come to Singapore. Truly a wonderful experience which changes with flower seasons and special exhibitions. It was a treat for us to be there when the roses were in full bloom May/June.",,
,,Simply Stunning With Exceptional Value For Money,5,,"The gardens were absolutely stunning - we were very surprised to find that the majority of the gardens and the evening light shows were entirely free.

The only areas that required purchase were the sky walk - this provided excellent views of the area and at less than 拢10 were excellent value - and the two air conditioned greenhouses.

Describing these as greenhouses does them a disservice as they are gigantic and filled with a huge variety of plants, butterflies and water features.",,
,,Garden Paradise,5,,This is a beautiful attraction. Visit the floral display and the 4D ride at the end. So much fun I couldn't stop smiling,,
,,A walk in the park,5,,"Most beautiful scenery and clever garden design, spent about 3/4 hours touring the area . Very enjoyable and worth viewing",,
,,"Great to visit, nice garden stroll",5,,Gardens by the bay is in a great location and makes for a very nice afternoon walk around the parkland. There are also some paid activities but heaps to explore free of charge as well,,
,,Beautiful,5,,So many plants thrive in the warm weather of Singapore and the displays here are top class. The gardens are spectacular when viewed at night.,,
,,Beautiful Garden,5,,Beautiful Flowers n Plants. Took a lot of photo in here. Love it. Must prepare with empty memory card n camera batt.,,
,,Major Bougainvillea,5,,"The ambiance here is very relaxing, the plants can relieve stress. The place is also airconditioned.",,
,,Night time laser show,5,,Ok great show. Two shows 1945 and 2045 hours. Well worth the crowds. We arrived by taxi and walked out through marina hotel complex. Just follow crowds to get out.,,
,,Beautiful place,5,,Both gardens are beautiful to walk around in. Take water. Its hot outdoor. But it is worth the price. Go back at night for the light show.,,
,,Really neat.,5,,"I love these urban oases type of places. I went for the light-show in the evening, which was tons of fun. Neat gardens to walk through. I鈥檒l do the flower dome and cloud mountain separately.",,
,,Best exhibits of tulips and orchids,5,,"Used to hold annual pass during tulip exhibition season. Worth visiting to admire the beautiful flowers, cool temperature and floral scents. Favorite exhibits: Tulipmania and Orchid. Go early morning to avoid crowds to take good pictures at the exhibition area.",,
,,"More than we expected, amazing",5,,"It was a very hot day the day we visited, so the AC was very welcome.
There was a tulip festival on when we visited, amazing displays and colours.
Lots of wood carvings throughout the gardens ranging from dragons, rabbits, Alice in wonderland characters - all very impressive.
Definitely worth a visit.",,
,,Fabulous flora in Singapore,5,,We regularly visit Singapore and always make a point of visiting Gardens by the Bay. Superb displays all year round. When we visited there was a rose exhibition in the Flower Dome which was stunning. We also visited the newly opened area Floral Fantasy which was fabulous. Easy access via Bayfront MRT. Only disappointment was the reopened dining area at Supertree Grove which used to be wonderful. Nevertheless a must do when in Singapore. Would highly recommend.,,
,,"Review of Gardens by the Bay, Singapore",5,,"They should list restaurants as well on their sign post maps so they would be so much more easier to locate. Easy to buy fresh flowers, love the idea of aroma perfume by type of wild flowers. T-shirts are on the expensive side but hey, they are meant as tourist souvenirs and I am a local. Those in prams and wheelchairs, and the sick aged are not able to experience the 3D movies where seats vibrate and move in accordance to sounds and thuds from the movie being watched. As such, make sure they have adult company while the rest of your family enjoy their 3D movie first. I think the idea of entry by hour is a smart thing they have, so there is no chance of overcrowding any floral events. Entry by scanning barcode ticket on mobile phone is also very convenient.",,
,,Exquisite Trip!,5,,"The 2 cooled conservatories are amazing, filled with many plants from all over the world, not to mention the water fall in cloud forest! If you are on budget, do also check out the gardens, they have a Garden Rhapsody show every night at the Supertree Groove, find a spot near the garden trails so it is less crowded (basically no people there) to watch the performance! A stroll around the gardens at night is also wonderful!",,
,,Fabulous structures and gardens,4,,"this is a ""must-do"" in Singapore if you have even a little love of plants. The architecture throughout the garden features is amazing - as - of course- are the plantings.",,
,,Man made beauty,5,,The cloud forest and flower do me are a must see here. It really amazing how people have built and maintained it. The message of importance of flora and fauna has been delivered beautifully.,,
,,The beautiful Gardens by the bay,5,,Very nice to see at night. You can learn about science and watch out the rhapsody at 7pm where you can see the different colors of the tree.,,
,,"Great Gardens, marvellously manicured",5,,"Whilst you understand that it's all carefully curated, man made, manicured, it really is all very impressive. We did the two biomes, the skywalk (which in usually joined up Singaporel, annoying is ticketed separately to everything else) and easily spent 4 hours meandering- enjoying, learning and loving what we were seeing and experiencing.",,
,,Very enchanting,5,,"If you are a person who enjoys nature and artistic places, this is the place to go. This popular tourist attraction is accesible by bus and mrt, but eating here is not recommended (there is only one mcd and some unknown or fine dining restaurants, the mcd is always crowded). It has two botanic gardens (paid entrance) and a "" ""supertree grove"" which is basically a tall tower that you can go up (paid entrance, not reccomended for people with the fear of heights). But you can just enjoy the scenery and take pictures for free! It's worth it to visit and it is also close to gardens by the bay and merlion, so you can drop by.",,
,,Photographers dream outing,5,,"So much planning was put into this amazing and colourful dome. There such a variety of flowers, shrubs and trees with certain areas dedicated to different countries including Australia. The floral displays and roses were out of this world. Great place for many photographs",,
,,Must visit in Singapore,5,,"Man made, but interesting experience. It is amazing to see the greenery being created in a busy city.",,
,,Beautiful!,5,,"We got to see the beautiful gardens on a partly cloudy day with some steady drizzle when we went up top. I would recommend spending the money to walk the bridge for the views. Also, if you aren鈥檛 staying at the Marina Bay Sands - find your way to the walkway they have connecting them. There is a wonderful view of the entire garden from there (as seen in my photos)! It鈥檚 lit up at night and we got to see a beautiful light show from our balcony.",,
,,"Amazing, a sight to see",5,,Simply an amazing place to visit. Highly recommend the cloud and flower domes. Make sure you stay for the light and sound show in the evening.,,
,,Bloody Amazing !,5,,We鈥檝e seen gardens all over the world but this man-made structure takes the cake. Well worth the entrance fee and the unexpected bonus is that it is all air-conditioned!,,
,,Relaxing place,5,,Very beautiful arrangements of plants and flowers. Not too many people on weekdays. You can easily spend a few hours here and not be bored. Amazing how they maintain the quality of the plants.,,
,,gardens of heaven,5,,This is one of the best exhibitions of greenery I have ever experienced. And the location is great. A must visit.,,
,,Amazing,5,,"Amazing setup and build, the detail and quality and money spent on this park in mind blowing, it鈥檚 a credit the government and the people of Singapore well done.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"Such an amazingly beautiful park! The floral changes themes very quarterly, this means you can visit thtm 4 x a year. Never fail to disappoint. Always impress me and my friends/guests. But the waterfall at The Cloud remains my favourite",,
,,A must if visiting Singapore. Absolutely beautiful,5,,"There is so much to see here. From the indoor gardens, kids water area, ponds, water features, tree top walk, view of the marina bay sands and so much more.
The walkway in the alien like trees is well worth the minimal fee as the views are wonderful.
It鈥檚 worth visiting during the day and night as it鈥檚 so different. Access into the grounds is free. With admission prices from the main domes and. Walkway at addition costs.
With cafes, and food options available too plus free WiFi.",,
,,Fabulous light show,4,,"My husband and I went back to Gardens by the Bay as we had been there earlier in the day, but due to lighting being about couldn鈥檛 go on the Skywalk as close it then when lightning in the area.
So after our wonderful day looking at trees and plants which were fantastic, we ended back in time for the light show and our Skywalk.
It couldn鈥檛 have been better we were on the Skywalk while the light show was on, it just added to the fabulous day we had had.
Thank you so much Gardens by the Bay and to Alex who works there in the glass conservatory you were great and so knowledgable and when he couldn鈥檛 answer one of my questions about the Parrot tulips he made a phone call and I spoke to someone else who answered.. thank you so, so much.",,
,,Flower dome was beautiful,5,,The flower and forest dome was way too beautiful. Unfortunately our phone died that lead to captures for the day. No restrictions for photo taking. Clean and greenery. Flowers are all watered daily everything is so fresh. Will visit again. Staffs were friendly and helpful,,
,,Garden by the Bay (Flower Dome and Cloud Forest),5,,"I will visit again for another flower Theme for sure! I visited during the Tulip Season, and it was so pretty and awesome!",,
,,A must visit,5,,The Gardens are amazing and the stroll is worth. Go roam around and see n feel the variety housed in a single place. Both the domes are well maintained and have a amazing look in night.,,
,,Beautiful,5,,"This is a must visit place. Very beautiful and attractive. On weekends get crowded. 745 and 845 laser light show which is very good.

Flower dome and cloud forest is great place which is located close to each other. Recommended to visit flower dome before sunset and then visit cloud forest. We enjoyed cloud forest it has water fall. Very sceneries.

Must visit place.",,
,,The best tourist attraction til. In Singapore,5,,"This is a must see when visiting Singapore. The cloud and flower dome are just beautiful. We spent the entire morning in the two domes.
You need a full day to cover the grounds. We will go back another time to visit the rest. I highly recommend visiting.",,
,,Great value,5,,"Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous! We stumbled in looking to kill some tome and ended up spending the whole afternoon wondering around. Beautiful presentations and thoughtful layouts mean there鈥檚 so much to see and explore. Best money spent!",,
,,Last day in Singapore,5,,We had planned to visit at night to see it all lit up but unfortunately the weather was stormy so we decided not to go. We went the next day and found the gardens quite spectacular. The flowers were amazing and we especially loved the orchids. The waterfall was very good too. If you are visiting Singapore this should definitely be on your list of places to visit. The gardens were great even without the lights,,
,,A must see - only place like it in the world,5,,"Our trip to Gardens by the Bay was the highlight of our days in Singapore. It's truly a world class attraction, unlike any other botanical garden I've ever encountered. It's divided into two major wings - the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome.

Cloud Forest is its own self-contained ecosystem and a masterwork in landscape architecture - you often find yourself wondering where the artistry of God and nature begins and the art of man begins. The Flower Dome renders all of the world's different flower kingdoms before the visitor, with impressive setting and backgrounds to match.

The light show in the Supertree Garden is not to be missed; the arbor of metal puts on a symphonic light show to set off an evening in Singapore. Easily the highlight of our two weeks in Southeast Asia and worth every penny.",,
,,Fabulous location for a visit,5,,As a lover of gardens this was just beautiful. We enjoyed both inside and outside and could have spent much more time exploring all of the gardens. We were here about 4 hours and had lunch as well.,,
,,Wonderful Plantings,4,,"A full day is needed to visit all the features at Gardens By the Bay in Singapore. We also enjoyed a lovely meal at midday then a walk to the Tree Walk (closed due to dark clouds). We walked to the Cloud Forest and had a fantastic time admiring plants from everywhere while being up as high as the top of a forest canopy. Afternoon Tea at the Pollen cafe was a little expensive but needed after the walking through both Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. Back to try the walk at Trees - again closed due to 'dark clouds' this was all from 1pm to 4pm. We decided that to sit 3 hours and wait for the light and sound show was a bit futile so left disappointed. By the way, it didn't rain till 5.30pm!",,
,,Gardens By The Bay,4,,Have been to Gardens By The Bay twice. First time during the day second time late afternoon and stayed for the light show. If you want to go through the domes pre purchase tickets on line to avoid queuing. These are well worth viewing. If you want to just see the light show and the gardens outside the domes no ticket is required entry is free. The starting time of the show depends on time of year.,,
,,Incredible,5,,"We spent time in Cloud Forest & Flower Dome. Spectacular, beautiful, nice temperature inside, children should wear a sweater if going inside.
However the temperature outside is very hot, it's better to come into 2 Domes at the late afternoon & then come out at 7.30pm to watch the light show.",,
,,Light show,4,,"Didn't visit the domes, just went to have a look around and see the light show. No charge for the light show which was 15 minutes long and quite good",,
,,Just increadible,5,,"We spent a couple of hours here, incredible experience the things that are created in Singapore cannot be overstressed.",,
,,Spectacular place to visit,4,,We timed our visit for the evening light show with accompanying music. Well worth experiencing to see the huge artificial 鈥渢rees鈥?illuminated by the light show. The hawker food outlets on the edge of the grounds are an interesting experience too.,,
,,Variety of things to see and do.,4,,"I visited the Gardens by the Bay during the day, as I didn't have a night time free.
Walking through the Flower Dome was lovely, very peaceful. The Cloud Dome also fantastic, and the walkway was great.
I would love to go back and see it at night with the lights, I imagine it would be spectacular",,
,,The crown jewel of Singapore.,5,,"This park with 101 hectares of land area is a reclaimed land in central Singapore. This is Gardens by the Bay, a magnificent oasis teeming with spectacles and delights. You can find leisure and recreational activities, educational programs and tours at these gardens. What鈥檚 more, a visit here lets you get in touch with nature.

There are a lot of attractions in the Gardens by the Bay, all you need is to choose which one will suit your taste. This is also great for family bonding, date for two and a connection among your circle of friends.",,
,,Awesome .... and cool !,5,,Great activity to do during the heat of the day. Both domes were spectacular and definitely worth a visit. Crowds move freely around and plenty of things to see.,,
,,Surprisingly brilliant,5,,"We called in on a 12 stopover. Easy taxi ride from airport and the Gardens were like a double shot espresso of inspiration and interest. 800 year old olive trees set beside huge date palms in perfect reproduction of middle eastern gardens, then 30 metres away a stunning rose bed. The highlight was a walk through orchid garden at nose height for a full olfactory blast. This garden is a must visit. So good.",,
,,beautiful place like heaven,4,,colorful with many flower variances. many people there to take pictures. it is suggested to arrive there before luncuh time so yo will have spent more space to take nice picture wihtout crouded people walked around.,,
,,Green gardens galore!,5,,What an unexpected delight. We attended during 鈥渞oses鈥?month. Both major conservatories are fully air conditioned and decided to hang around for the light show. Spectacular is the descriptor that comes to mind. Despite a fairly long wait for a show that runs for only 15 minutes I have to say it was all worth while.,,
,,A must see,5,,An amazing attraction showcasing plants and trees from around the world. Perhaps slightly 鈥榦ut of this world鈥?but well worth the ticket price to spend half a day. Lovely and cool inside the domes and an excellent lunch at the mini hawker market.,,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,"We spent a nice day here despite the thunderstorm.
My advice would be to wear thongs and take disposable raincoats . Shuttle buses could be accessed if desired for a small fee.
Roses were the feature . It was very colourful , and well maintained.
We also went into the cloud dome and thought this was amazing, with its 7 floor indoor waterfall. Misting occurred whilst we were there and this was our favourite",,
,,"Pretty walk, but Singapore has better",3,,"The visit is compulsory even if just to see the electric trees... One of the very few locations actually in Singapore in Crazy Rich Asians!
The gardens are nice for a stroll but that is about it. If it is too hot, go to the Botanical Gardens, much cooler.
We were wrong to think there was only one entrance, you can access it through the main entrance or though another one by the Marina Bay Sands.",,
,,What an Amazing Place!,5,,"We loved wandering the gardens in the day, but in the night the gardens come into their own! What an amazing place! We visited the gardens on three different occasions, and managed to squeeze in another visit before leaving Singapore! The cloud garden is exceptional and we completed visited it twice. The range of flowers in the flower dome are amazing. I can't wait to visit again!",,
,,Space Trees are awesome!,4,,"Hello Traveller,

Welcome to the corner of my mind. I must gently say, with profound enthusiasm that the Space Trees will take you to the moon. They have a show at night where the trees dash and flash lights to music. We went on disco night and my husband danced like he never had! Never have I seen him let loose like that! Seriously, the space trees will take you there!!!",,
,,Beautiful place,5,,If you love flowers and greenery you will definitely like different variety of flowers and plants over here....we loved it.There are wheelchairs available at the entrance for 2 dollars for those with mobility problem.,,
,,A must,4,,"Its so fun and cozy to walk around this well planned botanical garden. I would advice to come here in lunch time hour. Start your visit by stroll around The Shoppes. Then around 4 pm,start your walk to the garden. The garden is divided into 2, the free section and the entrance fee section. Both section always filled with visitors. For any visitors that brought kids stroller, I would advise you guys to avoid the entrance fee section because its not so stroller friendly and the path inside tend to be crowded. Its better to enter the garden from the The Shoppes rather than direct from Bayfront mrt.",,
,,Check if skyway opens before you go,4,,"We came to visit and got into one of the garden conservatory. There were beautiful orchids, roses, and many type of tropical flowers. The flowers were beautiful! We also watched a 4D movie. It feels like a tourist attraction because they are all man made. It was raining in the morning. They closed the skyway because of the weather. Make sure you check before you come.",,
,,A must see whilst in Singapore!,5,,"I am a travel advisor and even though I was unable to use my OCBC Sky walk ticket due to the weather I had a lovely time going through the gardens as well as the flower Dome, Cloud Forest and Floral Fantasy. I don't think I have ever seen anything so beautiful in my life. Everything is so well thought out at Gardens by the Bay and I know they will be adding more gardens. When Singapore does something they do it well, with passion and love. You cannot go to this country without visiting Gardens by the Bay! I already recommend this to all of my customers but now I have been they will surely know this is a must see, I have plenty of photo's and video's!",,
,,Fascinating and aromatic,5,,Great stuff. Love the smells when I first entered and the 4D ride is amazing. Guess it would be better for shorter queues for the ride.,,
,,Great place!,5,,"Clean, cooling, well maintained. Kids get to see different plants instead of just seeing it from the book.

Occasionally there鈥檚 some flower exhibitions. It鈥檚 quiet and spacious at the flower area.

The cloud forest section gives a feeling of being inside a forest.

Bring a cardigan for young children. It can get quite chilly.",,
,,Good place to visit whatever the weather,4,,We visited on a terrible day weather wise and found the greenhouses an excellent place to visit in the rain. Allow approx 1 hour for each of the large greenhouses.,,
,,Nice flower arrangement. Very beautiful,5,,"Visited the Floral Fantasy for the first time. It is the latest and newly opened flower dome, and it is really beautiful. Lots of different types of flowers, some are quite rare. The 4d show is a huge catch for children. And the hanging flower balls are really impressive.",,
,,Great attraction in Singapore but creepy baby sculpture!,4,,"Singapore is a very modern city, and to balance this out, these gardens by the bay offer a welcome nature-break. Beautifully designed and a fun light-show every evening, well worth a visit for a nice low key stroll - best time probably late afternoon going into dusk to catch the gardens in the daylight then the skywalk & lightshow. Be warned however, there is a very strange and creepy male baby sculpture which is quite out of place and a bit disturbing!",,
,,Gift shop at visitor center,5,,"Ive been to the Gardens countless times and I always enjoyed the visit. The conduct of staff at both Domes, the MacDonalds and the shuttle service is exemplary. However I feel let down by the staff at the gift shops especially the one at the Visitor Center. Tourists see anyone in uniform as representation of this renown world class garden. Therefore all staff then should be cordial, welcoming and helpful. On one occassion i happen to chance on a mother with a child in tow and a baby in pram trying to exit the gift shop. She had trouble keeping the glass door open for her exit with the pram and child in tow. No staff came forward. I think they are more worried about their items being broken or stolen! They tend to behave more like curators of museum relics!",,
,,"no clear signboard at mrt point to floral fantasy, please improve on the signboard",1,,"no clear signboard at mrt point to floral fantasy, we went to flower dome & need take the $3 shuttle train back to mrt again",,
,,Always finds interesting,5,,Garden by the way (GBTW) always has something new to offer and mesmerises with abundance of flora and fauna!,,
,,Superb,4,,Must visit these gardens if you are in Singapore. Both Flower dome and Cloud Forest are worth spending time. Amazing supertree grove and sky walk is a treat to your eyes,,
,,Spectacular,5,,Make sure you set aside a day for this. Just stunning and so much to explore. Really worth paying to see the two conservatives. Loved loved the cloud forest.,,
,,Worth the hype!,5,,"These gardens are beautiful and worth the visit. This is great for couples, families or just by yourself. All of this area is very accessible also.",,
,,Blown away,5,,Even if you're not a gardener this place will blow you away. If you are short on time Cloud Dome is the better of the two domes so dont miss that one. The trees are pretty spectacular as well even when they are not lit up. If you are going after dark take some insect repellent as there are mozzies around.,,
,,Beautiful flowers and long walk.,4,,"Strictly for flowers lovers. Good for couple dating as well. Ensure to bring cardigan or shawl to wrap yourself with it, the dome is extremely cold. It takes you more than 3 hours to walks the entire place. Not really a place to visit for small children.",,
,,Unbelievable experience,5,,"Would highly recommend a visit to Gardens By The Bay - an outstanding attraction, easy to get to by MRT.
Even if it鈥檚 raining the gardens you can stay dry by visiting the dome gardens.
If you travel on Singapore Airlines and show your boarding pass you get a discount at this attraction",,
,,Good for tourists,4,,Brought a Friend to gardens by the Bay to see the nightly light show. A great way to showcase something unique in Singapore and explore the Bay Area for dinner and walks.,,
,,Go for the foc lightings/musical Rhapsody show at night,5,,"It was great although this was the 4th or 5th time there. Place was crowded with tourists but it doesn鈥檛 affect us. There are 2 sessions every day, 7:45pm and 8:45pm. Check the website for latest info.
When the show was about to start锛寃e found another spot on the grass and just lay down- 1st time experience watching the show while laying down was amazing and relaxing (as the best seats and spots were already taken by the big crowd).
The place is pleasant to walk around. You can easily spent hours here. But as there are oldies with us and they get tired, we just head home right after the show.

I will probably bring a picnic mat during Our next visit and just lay on the mat enjoying the music and show.",,
,,Must Experience,4,,The Gardens by the Bay is a glorious place. Crowded but that was expected. The night light show was wonderful. Don't forget the bug spray.,,
,,Review,5,,"Excellent experience. Photogenic location, worth spending complete noon and after that the laser show..",,
,,Beautiful,4,,Better at night ... still one of the best places I visited in singapore ... although after the visit we had to wait for 25 minutes to find a taxi,,
,,Domes and Satay by the Bay,5,,"Went twice to Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. Cloud Forrest is impressive at any time and better enjoyed during the week when crowds are lower (picture taking can be excessive and hold up the walkways). Flower dome is more subtle, slow down to really enjoy. Special exhibit flowers change frequently making repeat visits worthwhile if flowers are your thing. Got caught in the rain at Satay by the Bay, which turned into a highlight. Great Satay (better than Lau Pa Sat even) and best green curry I鈥檝e ever tasted. We then hung out at the bar with Tigers to wait out the rain while viewing the floating hippos in the water garden and cooled by the huge fans under the pavilion.",,
,,Stunning gardens,5,,"Peaceful and wonderful gardens to stroll through before or after your visit to the iconic green houses of Cloud Forest. Simply magnificent gardens, with their famous elevated structures.",,
,,If you do nothing else...,5,,"This is a fantastic experience. We did the flowers and the cloud garden as well as the outdoor sky bridge. We spent hours looking at all of the plants - they have really done a magnificent job pulling together species from around the world. Highly recommend this for anyone who's interested in plants even a tiny bit.

One suggestion to the team curating Gardens by the Bay is that we really would have appreciated more labels for the different, exotic flower species. Also, just note that there are loads of rude tourists stopping traffic to take family photos like this is Olan Mills. Ugh. But that's not really a reflection on the place - enjoy your time there!",,
,,"Nice waterpark, but bad food",4,,"We visited Gardens by the Bay with our two kids (3 and 5 years old). The highlight was the water park. It was great! There was also a nice playground close by.
The selection of food was rather poor (only fast food), so be sure to bring your own snack and lots of water.
We visited in late december so the experience in the Flower Dome was ruined due too very tacky Disney Christmas Decorations. We wanted to see all the flowers and such, not Disney characters. On the other hand, the Cloud Forest was a really cool experience and well worth a visit.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,A beautiful afternoon spent at Gardens by the bay. Lovely tour around on the trolley and stayed for the lights on the evening.,,
,,Wonderful thing to do if your in Singapore,5,,It was lovely to visit the gardens and the flower dome which is air conditioned and a great way to escape the heat. The gardens are beautiful and inspiring with many sculptures incorporated into the gardens. Loved it!,,
,,A must-do.,5,,Simply spectacular & something you can't miss in Singapore. Even the kids had a great few hours exploring.,,
,,Go!,5,,Wow! Where to begin? The world's largest greenhouse. This is an amazing place. You have to see it and experience it first-hand to believe it. Words alone are very nearly inadequate to say just how truly wonderful this place is! Plants from six of the seven continents. A multi-story man-made cloud forest mountain simulation. First-class. Top notch! Superb! Extraordinary!,,
,,Beautiful Gardens,4,,These beautiful internal gardens cover each section of the world. Be prepared it was much cooler inside than outside. An amazing feat.,,
,,Fantastic experience,5,,"Fantastic experience and really worth a visit for half day, in pure contact with the nature. My compliment to people of Singapore to this great tribute to the mother nature.",,
,,Mighty and magnificent - a wonderland in Singapore.,5,,My only regret in my visit to Singapore was not to allocate sufficient time for Gardens by the Bay. It is a true masterpiece of construction and creativity. I am sure that it will duly be recognised as a site of international significance. Be sure to arrange a scheduled time to visit the Skywalk as you would surely regret not viewing the park and the Singapore skyline from such a fantastic viewing point. A note of caution - you may not be asked when you purchase your tickets.,,
,,mesmerizing,5,,Huge area...Flower dome was dazzling with rose. Just love it. Cloud forest was also mesmerizing. Must visit..dont miss,,
,,Amazing place,5,,"We got a taxi from resort (cheap) and spent the day looking around, this has some amazing gardens and is well worth paying to go in the glass buildings. A fantastic place to visit.",,
,,Brilliant and a must!,5,,"Stunning to see, and the wait to get to aerial walkway was not long even though the queue looked long. Stunning light show at night, with a great atmosphere! Felt really safe too!",,
,,Extraordinary,5,,"What a mesmerising place. Other than the two glasshouses, for which there is a charge, this remarkable creation is free and you could spend hours soaking up the sights. It is beautifully tended and manicured and you鈥檇 be crazy not to come and visit on any trip to Singapore. Come back in the evening too for the free light show.",,
,,Very nice and cooling place,5,,"It is a very calming area with loads of long winding roads to walk around. If u go to the actual place with the bigass fake trees, the light shows at night are pretty damn nice.",,
,,Visit with the family,5,,"Worth the time and the ticket cost! Highly recommended. The gardens are amazing, with a plethora of trees and flowers from around the world.",,
,,Absolute must do,5,,"Two totally different experiences but both are 'must dos'. Coinciding with the Alice in Wonderland exhibition, the Flower Dome's Aloes Garden is both exquisite and captivating while the Cloud Dome is sensational, with the highlight being the indoor waterfall. Do allow at least 1.5hrs to each Dome, if not longer.",,
,,A must,5,,"The Area is a fantastic place for relaxing. The trees, the garden; the exibitions and some Indonasian restaurants enjoyable. The evening light show a super event. View on Marina Bay Sands Hotel does complete the scene",,
,,Must see beauty!,5,,"Lovely spot to spend an evening/night. The chill breeze at night, especially, is so relaxing. The cloud forest is a must do attraction with a lot of awe inspiring flowers and plants. Very well maintained restroom facilities.",,
,,A great family place!,5,,"The gardens are always a Singapore highlight. It isn't just a garden that shows you these different flora, it's interactive and gives every single person an opportunity to appreciate what nature does.",,
,,Great place - Must go !,5,,"This is one place I fully recommend my friends to go when they some time. Get there after tea about 3 plus, you can have tea at the Marina Bay Sands shopping mall or food court and stroll via the bridge across. Bring a hat though cuz the sun is pretty strong. Get your tickets and into the cool domes. Wait till 7 plus for the outside lights show and it鈥檚 so amazing.",,
,,Amazing,5,,Visited the gardens on a quick stop over in Singapore. I would not typically visit a garden however this was amazing. I took over 100 photos. Would recommend this everyone visiting Singapore. You can easily spend 3 hours here.,,
,,Three Days in SG was the best decision ever.,5,,"It was actually a very important occasion why i come in SG.My visa expired and i need to get a new one.For three days i wasn't really bother to sleep and take a rest instead.Was trying to see how beautiful Singapore is.My firstime and my fav. Country above all people are just so generous and super helpful.The area sorrounding were just clean and everything was just a dream.

We we're visiting with my Aunt the one of the touristy spot and instragrammable Garden by the Bay.Guess what i fell inlove about it.I hope one day i would come back here and will visit the universal studio which is the great place to visit first.Sadly but i was having a hechtic time.

Once again i love Singapore.",,
,,"Go for the gardens, stay for the lightshow",5,,"We had an amazing visit to the gardens, the 2 domes are both well worth seeing. My favourite was the cloud forest. We went to both in the afternoon, had a nice dinner onsite, than watched the lightshow in the supertrees then went back into the could forest once it was lit up while they were doing the misting, it was lovely.",,
,,Come for viewing varieties of flower,4,,Varieties of flower from all around the world. A great water fall is attracted me the mosted. U can pay $3 for shuttle to there.,,
,,Singapore Botanical Delight!,5,,"As a Londober eith the world famous Victorian Kew Botanical Gardens on my doorstep I didnt expect much from this Singapore modern version.
I was wrong!
The gardens are so creatively laid out that thete is domething for everyone in true modern Singapore style....
The diffetent zones provide a diverse range of worldwide flora. There are restsurants and pkaces to stop and if course.....a mini ekectric train to transport you.
Well worth a visit....",,
,,Purely stunning!,5,,The Gardens By The Bay will not disappoint. From the moment of entry there's pure beauty and artistry. There's so much to see. We didnt do a tour we paid our enterance fee and wandered ~ not disapointed at all. It is man made but its spectacular what they have done with the plants...,,
,,AMAZING,3,,"Very nice place to visit, But you have to walk atleast 4-5 kms to explore Gardens by the bay park and 2 domes one with beautiful flowers and plants and another dome with artificial water falls.",,
,,Depending on your currency/exchange rate,3,,"While the Gardens were interesting and highly recommended by other travelers on these sites, we personally were not ""spellbound"". Our current exchange rate is quite poor so we felt that it was not really worth the amount of money that we spent on a ticket.",,
,,Must do in SG!,5,,"My family loves this place so much that we have purchased annual passes for two years running. Yes, it鈥檚 man-made and kinda artificial, but it鈥檚 also really peaceful (when not too crowded) and a lovely retreat from scorching Singapore.

Tips: go as early as possible to beat the crowd. Even just 11am makes a difference from the afternoon, when the crowd hits its peak. Visit both domes. For parents, if you can spare the trouble, pack swim gear for young ones so they can play at the water park after. They鈥檒l love it! Satay by the Bay is my favorite lunch option.",,
,,A roof over a Beaurtiful Forest,5,,"It is amazing to see a giant tree top walk and a large waterfall in the middle of a city.
It looks like a dinosaur land and the experience is mind blowing at the heights you walk along the see through flooring. Young and old alike will enjoy and it brings an adult to childhood.",,
,,Garden by the bay,5,,"It was a lovely experience, enjoyed the walk and also the musical performance. There have servers event depending on the festival. It was also close by the flower dome, which is another place not to be missed",,
,,The cloud forest is just magical!,5,,"We really liked exploring all of the gardens around the bay, but the cloudforest was easily the highlight. The flower dome was nice too, and can change through the seasons with different showings.",,
,,Disappointing!,2,,"We had heard so much about Gardens by the Bay and we enjoyed the (free) gardens, but found the two domes (for which you pay admission) to be a huge disappointment. It was way too crowded with families and individuals blocking walking paths while trying to take photos. The domes are open until 9pm, but I would strongly advise against going after dark. It was difficult to see some of the plantings and, again, super crowded. We ended up going in the evening because the day we first tried to go, only one dome was open so we wandered the free parts of Gardens by the Bay. I鈥檓 glad we ended up seeing the domes, but would not go back. If you are limited on time or money, I would skip the domes. Enjoy the free surrounding gardens or enjoy the fantastic, much more beautiful Singapore Botanic Gardens. I would definitely go back to the Botanic Gardens multiple times, but not the domes at Gardens by the Bay.",,
,,First Visit in Singapore,5,,Very Beautiful! But I'd like to see more flowers 馃尲馃尭馃尯馃尮Free of charge but I suggest the management to add more attractions,,
,,Definitely worth a visit!,5,,Singapore as more to offer than you might think and this is definitely somewhere that has a lot to offer.,,
,,One of the best garden experiences in the world,5,,"Gardens by the Bay, Singapore is one of my favourite places to visit. The amazing numbers of plants they have, immaculately cared for areas of the gardens and the sheer colours are breathtaking. In the Flower Dome during June/July is a display of thousands of roses such an amazing view.",,
,,Stunning Light Show,5,,We enjoyed the light show set to music one night. It had the vibe of Disneyland fir adults. Next time I鈥檓 in Singapore I鈥檇 like to visit more of the park.,,
,,Tulip season 2019,4,,"Visit during the Tulip season with my mother who loves flowers. The general experience was very good except for the cramp we encountered inside the Flower Dome. Gardens by the Bay has very spacious walking area, good for family w prams and minimal staircases. A place to visit for both locals and tourists -)",,
,,Great place for plant and garden lovers,4,,Inside the domes were cooling and enjoyed the comfort of being surrounded by lush greenery. Worth to spend some time to watch the forest light show in the evening as well.,,
,,Garden by The Bay,5,,Therapeutic and peaceful enviroment. You also get to see variety of flowers and plants. It is a must go place to experience Garden by The Bay. Stay up till the night to see the changing colours of the trees.,,
,,Fantastic place to visit,5,,"Went here whilst in Singapore and it was great, the domed gardens are really nice and have a/c so it's a welcome break from the midday heat. We spent about 3 hours here so worked out good value",,
,,Gardens by the Bay- Singapore,5,,"Took an evening tour with City Tours so were taken there in an semi open top DoubleDecker bus from Suntec city City Tours offices. Its just behind the Marina Bay Sands Hotel on recovered land from the sea.
A lovely experience seeing the light & sound show though would have been great if some more proper sitting arrangements were provided as is popular and uncomfortable for elderly persons to sit on the road wherever they could!!!
Nonetheless really entertaining and really mesmerising to walk across the ropeway top getting good views and seeing the show.
Nice collections of Restaurants indoors too to round off the evening.
Recommend to visit.",,
,,Flower power,5,,"We enjoyed visiting Singapore Botanical Gardens and the Gardens by the Bay. Not being a keen gardener, thy flowers werer pretty but what I enjoyed most was the tranquility of the place, getting away from the hustle and bustle of the big city",,
,,Fascinating and full of character,5,,"I last visited about 5 years ago and it was excellent then, but it has improved even more. The displays and explanatory materials are wonderful. If I lived in Singapore, I would be there several times a year!",,
,,Garden by the Bay strongly recommended,4,,"Many beautiful plants and flowers, very nice atmosphere. It is recommend to come in the afternoon as other places in Singapore is too warm and humid. In the evening you may even strolled around the area outside the drome and even walk to Marina Bay Sands.",,
,,Outstanding garden feature,5,,"This is an outstanding garden. Most of it is free entry and offers pleasant walks with a variety of gardens and other features. The sound and light show in the evening is a highlight. There are 3 features for which there is a charge. It is worthwhile doing some forward planning and buying discounted tickets from booking agents in Singapore. The Flower Dome is interesting but I enjoyed the Cloud Forest more. The Sky Walk is definitely worth the cost but you may have to queue for a while. As well as an entry ticket, you need to collect a time entry card from the ticket booth.",,
,,Absolutely beautiful,5,,"We spent hours at Gardens by the Bay. There is so much to see and we especially loved the Cloud Forest, Flower Dome and the Supertrees. The light show of a night is nothing short of amazing and the music is perfectly timed with the light display. This is an absolute must do while in Singapore!",,
,,Fantastic,5,,Went by day and by night. The glass houses are just wonderful. Worlds highest indoor waterfall with all the flowers growing vertically. Brilliant. The light show at night should not be missed. Relax and enjoy.,,
,,Exotic Plants and Great Buildings,4,,The Cloud Forest amaze me the most. Its cold inside where outside is about 36 degrees. No wonder exotic plants can grow here.,,
,,Holiday,5,,Gardens by the Bay is amazing. A must see. So many beautiful flowers and gardens. The waterfall is awesome. So well set out. Places to eat and drink.,,
,,Amazing,5,,"We went to Singapore 15 years ago before the Gardens by the Bay was constructed. It鈥檚 amazing. We did the skywalk at about 7pm so we were up when the lights started to come on ! We saw Singapore light up. Then we did the Cloud Forest and came back to the Music/Light Show, not to be missed.",,
,,Flowers mania at Gardens by the bay,4,,"I recently visited the Gardens by the Bay in Spore and was treated to a array of beautiful flowers and plants. The whole place was with flowers and plants and were beautifully planted and created for visitors. It was within a cool space that you can walk around and enjoy the flowers and also taking beautiful pictures.
A very nice way to spend an afternoon in Spore.

THe tickets are approx. $23 per person and discounts for kids and older people.

I would recommend visitors to go and have a nice afternoon",,
,,great,4,,Gardens by the bay is a must inclusion in your itinerary. Lush green plants and orchards make it a wonderful experience. Even the toilets are worth visiting.,,
,,Extraordinaire,5,,Beautiful and colourful flowering plants. The entire design landscaping are all very impressive. The adventure walk is very pleasant in cool air-conditioned environment. Great for photography and soaking in the beauty of the many species of flowers and plants.,,
,,Breathtaking Gardens!,5,,"The Flower Dome, Cloud Forest, Far East Children's Garden were just magnificent. And refreshing in the Singapore heat. Wonderful light & sound show at the Sky Trees",,
,,A Plant lovers delight,4,,"If you are into plants or just want to walk around in a climate controlled environment looking at plants, flowers, orchids etc. Then this place doesn鈥檛 disappoint. East to get there and excellent views of the iconic Marina bay sands. However, for someone like a city dweller like me, who doesn鈥檛 know the difference between flora and fauna :), the trip was just for the experience and a chance to escape the humidity of the city",,
,,It's a man made beauty,5,,"Amazing place. Looks like some natural wonder. It's astonishing that humans can build something like this. Everything inside is picture perfect.. Collection of flowers, species, waterfall.. Crowd management etc everything is well managed.",,
,,Amazing place!! A must visit!!,5,,An amazing experience. The cloud dome took us almost 1.5 hours to finish. The kids were disinterested in the start but as we went ahead they had so much to see and gasp that they became really engrossed. A must visit especially in evening.,,
,,Nature lovers park,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is a nature park spanning 101 hectares of reclaimed land in the Central Region of Singapore. The park consists of three waterfront gardens: Bay South Garden, Bay East Garden and Central Garden. The largest of the gardens is Bay South Garden at 54 hectares. It comprises of two cooled conservatories- the Flower Dome and the Cloud forest. Flower Dome is the largest columnless glass green house in the world. My visit was during the 鈥淭ulip mania鈥?flowers theme and hence I got to enjoy plenty of tulips view in different lovely colours. Cloud Forest features a 42-metre 鈥淐loud Mountain鈥? accessible by an elevator, and visitors will be able to descend the mountain via a circular path where a 35-metre waterfall provides visitors with refreshing cool air. Gardens by the Bay is part of the nation鈥檚 plans to transform its 鈥淕arden City鈥?to a 鈥淐ity in a Garden鈥? with the aim of raising the quality of life by enhancing greenery and flora in the city. They have few more themed gardens and I guess shows too which makes it a whole day visit. The dark view of this beautifully decorated place I am sure would be amazing too. It was a completely refreshing experience away from the humid weather as it was quiet cold with temperature at around 24 degree Celsius. A must visit for nature, flowers and plant lovers.",,
,,Transport to Garden of Eden,5,,This is a world class attraction. You are surrounded by real forest scent. The design of the foral is out of this world.,,

,,Gardens by the Bay - more than 1 visit,5,,"So cooling in the flower dome, a welcome respite from Singapore hot weather. I think I will get a annual pass to visit more often at discounted price, there are seasonal changes in flower arrangement such as Japanese month where sakura blossom can be admired.",,
,,Good place for all ages,4,,We go here quite often either for the two green houses which are fin to visit (against a charge) to view all sorts of plants from all over the world or to keep or kids entertained at the wet and dry outdoor playgrounds. They are huge and kids don't get tired of playing there for hours.,,
,,Amazing amazing,5,,"The flower dome and cloud forest where fantastic, when you walk into both of these you are blown away with what has been achieved. Both totally different but so worth seeing. The price is worth it and even if you have to line up in the cloud forest to walk the walk way to the waterfall do so it is wonderful. The sculptures in the flower dome were a stand out there is something to see everywhere. Well done Singapore. Walking around the park is great to, stay for the light show which starts at 1945, beautiful.",,
,,Visit to Gardens,5,,"This attraction is rated as a must see in Singapore,and I was not disappointed,spectacular display of gardens, tulips were the main display when we visited. There are thousands of plants shrubs trees etc in both the areas and the waterfall in the dome is brilliant. The other good thing is it is a nice comfortable temperature in both areas. A must see if you go to Singapore.",,
,,Superb place to visit,5,,"Flower dome - A new set of flower species are displayed every few months. Best to time your visit with the forthcoming display.

Cloud Forest dome - best place to visit especially if the weather is hot. And it is often hot in Singapore. Kids love the huge waterfall and cool air inside.

We signed up for a family membership, so we make full use of it.",,
,,Gardens by the bay,5,,"Nice place to visit in the evenings after 7pm , cooling & excellent views , best is walk through Marina Bay Sa rd Hotel .......it鈥檚 congrats all the way ,
Do chk the schedule of events happening at gardens by the bay , this attraction if you visit Singapore is a must VISIT place",,
,,Worth the visit,5,,"Worth the visit, food is available at the food hall, sky walk is also a must. If you do the cloud forest do it last to enjoy the airconditioning.",,
,,Incredible!!,5,,We visited the gorgeous Gardens by the Bay and visited the two special conservatories: The Flower Dome and The Cloud Forest. Both were so individual and diverse and I'm so glad we decided to see both of these additional attractions. We also took a ride around the whole gardens which I felt was a great way to see an overall of the entire gardens with all its sculptures and themed gardens. This was such a wonderful day out and I was equally impressed by the design and sustainability of the super trees and the powerful message in the Cloud Forest video regarding global warming and how we should all look after our beautiful unique planet. This was one of my favourite attractions in Singapore.,,
,,Modern and spacious,5,,The best man made gardens. Flower dome has seasonal floral display conducive in air-conditioned environment. The cloud forest is best to go in the morning to get the misty feel while walking on high bridges.,,
,,A remarkable facility,5,,"The Gardens by the Bay are quite remarkable! Well worth a visit, and they are cool (AC) once you get inside!",,
,,Great place for flowers,5,,Very pretty. Must go if you love flowers and want to see orchids. Highly recommend it. Great for photos,,

,,Gardens By the Bay Show,5,,"Excellent light show with music. It is really amazing & spectacular the way they presented. There are so many people who I am sure enjoyed the show. I am actually with my Aunt and she said, by far, this is the one she finds most interesting, fantastic indeed.",,
,,Loved visiting here,5,,Great spot to hang out and visit. Lots of things to see and do. I enjoyed the gardens with its vast space.,,
,,Good activity,5,,For a quick getaway from our meetings and convention this was a pleasant experience. You must see it if you stay at Marina Bay Sands.,,
,,Gardens by the Bay night visit,5,,"Right out of a scifi movie. The light effects are beautiful and you expect a creature from Avatar to show up at any moment. The scale and attention to detail make it a great post-dinner attraction, for a relaxing stroll, no matter its nature. Highly recommended",,
,,Absolutely Stunning,5,,We came here during the day and night for the light show and it was great. I would highly recommend this to anyone visiting Singapore. It was walking distance from our hotel (MBS) and we came here a few times during our stay. Such a beautiful part of Singapore.,,
,,Amazing up close,5,,I had a really great time wandering around the gardens and seeing all the super trees. From up close you can see how amazing this is and you can even walk close to branches up in the sky. Highly recommend it and feel the power.,,
,,Entertaining,5,,"One of the most iconic places in Singapore is Gardens by the Bay. It truly lives upto it's expectation and name. We had the opportunity as a family to see both the evening light shows (must do) and enjoyed them thoroughly. Every evening there is theme to this light show and ours was Retro. You could the skywalk and view this show, but the fun is to be at the ground level and see the lights dance to the music
Simple entertaining!",,
,,Amazing & Wondrous,5,,"Cloud Forest and Flower Dome wowed me with its vibrant colours, aroma of nature and serenity. The attractions accentuate the wonder of creation of a Master Creator! Simply magical!!",,
,,The Clouds,5,,Very happy experience in visiting Gardens By The Bay. Beautiful flowers everywhere . Worker are helpful and polite which I deeply appreciated.Good management in controlling visitors flow. I will recommend friends to visit.,,
,,Very nice flower displays,5,,"I visited the Floral Fantasy area and I would describe it as a stroll in the park. There are many beautiful flowers along the way and benches where you can sit and enjoy the place. I was pleasantly surprised by the adorable frogs exhibit at the end of the walk. At the end, there is a 4D ride showcasing Gardens by the Bay. When they said 4D, they really meant 4D ;) The area is small so the whole session lasted about 1 hour for us. I would recommend it if you like flowers but don't want to go to the Flower Dome.",,
,,Most beautiful garden in the world,5,,"It is a symbol of Singapore. A must visit place on Singapore trip and its true. There are thousands of plants, flowers planted and maintained inside the garden and it is beautiful. I was amazed seeing very tiny and small plants/flowers surviving in the hot Singapore atmosphere. When we went there it was a Sakura festival and all trees blossomed with sakura. Very beautiful. Flower dome and Cloud forest is chargeable but the price is nothing against what you see there. Cloud forest has man made waterfall and I think it is the high point of GBB. OCBC sky walk is also chargeable but It is altogether a different experience to see lighten supertrees from top. It is crowded but when you go up you can spend as much time as you want. If you are lucky u may get a chance to see light and sound show from top. Best thing is see one show from top and one from down, laying on the ground (It is the best).",,
,,A must see attraction in Singapore,5,,"If there is one place you must visit in Singapore it's this one. You can spend all day here as there are many things to see including the ""Super tree grove"" which does a twice nightly light show of music and colours all for free so just hang around the base of the trees and you will see people start to congregate. There is also 3 enclosed and air conditioned flower & plant displays at the ""flower fantasy"" & ""flower domes"" which are the two large domes seen from everywhere in the gardens. You need around an hour in each display to appreciate it properly. And if you are hungry look for the signs pointing to ""Satay by the bay"" for the cheapest satays and seafood sold by street market type vendors where $15 will feed 2 people.",,
,,Cool and relaxing garden with sound environmental policies,5,,"We spent a relaxing morning taking in the paid exhibits at Gardens by the Bay. Both were climate controlled on a hot day. The flower dome was visually appealing, but also very fragrant and the cloud forest was a tranquil, green escape set against the sounds of a 3 storey water fall. The environmental policies and educational aspects of the cloud forest are a very important community message about conservation, sustainability and the pathway towards a safe future for the planet",,
,,Visually pleasing..,3,,"A must for all travellers to Singapore! It's is artistic and colourful. It is a long walk though, so make sure you have enough time to get around it all.",,
,,Nice Garden and Huge Structure.,5,,Great Garden and can study the plant. in evening can see the light and sound. easy to get there by MRT.,,
,,Insanely Beautiful!,5,,"Flora and fauna of Singapore, displayed in a very eclectic and artsy way! This reminds me of Miracle Gardens in Dubai, but of course, both have their own characteristics. Gardens by the Bay is inspiring and gives a great big break from the sweltering humidity of Singapore. Very very beautiful!",,
,,Stunning,5,,Went around 9am. Great time of day. Not a gardener myself but total appreciation. This is a must do. Absolutely stunning. Loved the Dutch gardens. If you had time you could easily spend a day wondering around. . Would visit again,,
,,Floral Fantasy,2,,"It was rather small and it was very crowded, even though they limited the number of people going in. However, I went on a Sunday at 1pm, so if you were to go on a weekday morning it might not be that crowded. It would be better if its bigger because you can finish the place in 15 minutes (excluding the 4D experience).",,
,,Great family attraction,5,,"We visited here and had a great time. The key is to do the two domes in the late afternoon, grab some dinner at Satay by the Bay, and then come back into the gardens to watch the night light show.",,
,,Impressive structure for indoor garden.,3,,"This is an indoor garden with a spiral path for visitors to wander leisurely up to the top, or for older, or handicapped people to take the escalator to the top then walk down the gently down slopped path. The center of the building features a water fall. Unfortunately, the garden has no live. It has no butterfly, no fish, no frogs and no birds, just plants. It could have been a much more interesting place to visit otherwise.",,
,,A must visit,5,,A must visit in Singapore. Beautiful place. The light show at night is beautiful and must watch. Many eating outlets also available within the place.,,
,,Floral Fantasy,5,,"What a stunning exhibition at the Floral Fantasy dome. It is a rather new exhibition and the diversity of flowers and environment is just lovely. It is a very artistic exhibition full of surprises and some flower arrangements moving up and down displaying their beauty. Well done and once you have admired the display you finish off with a 4 D journey of the Gardens by the Bay. Just incredible. Please be aware that you have only one hour to visit this exhibition and it is plenty of time. Also I just loved the green, blue and yellow frog display.",,
,,"Very Good. Both the domes were cool, a nice surprise from outside heat.",4,,"Both the domes were good, but liked the cloud dome than the flower dome. A lot to see and admire especially the vast number of orchids plant and flowers.
BUT , be careful about the heat and the humidity. Am told it is always humid all year round. Mat get a burst of rain for few minutes and than dries off. Did not see any First Aid tents or help. Carry and drink plenty of water",,
,,OUR trip to gardens by the bay,3,,i enjoyed the water falls in the cloud forest. the flowers was not that fresh in flower doom but it is ok. my daughter mesmerized the scenery of all the flowers and it was ok.,,
,,Unique,5,,A unique place to visit and thoroughly recommend. I was a bit apprehensive but loved it once there. Worth getting access to the domes as they were superb. Very good!,,
,,Review,5,,"This is a very lively and fun place for couples, family and friends to come and visit and just spend quality time together.",,
,,Glorious Gardens,5,,"We visited Gardens by the Bay at night for the Super Trees music and light show as well as during the day to see the other exhibitions such as the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. Totally loved the experience, a sense of tranquility, beauty and reprieve from the humidity right in city.",,
,,Definitely worth a visit,5,,"If you're not into plants...wife wanted to go.....DON'T WORRY.
I'd tathet visit a motor museum, but this place is amazing and you are likely to spend a few hours here. The gardens are displayed well with lots of interesting areas with beautiful sculptures made from what appears to be driftwood.
The Cloud Forrest in the taller building is an incredible living structure with a huge waterfall and several elevated levels of walkways. There are also exhibitions about ecology, polution and saving the planet if you want to spend more time, but the sheer spectacle of the place is enough in itself.
I doubt you will be bored however little you are interested in nature.
RECOMMENDED
A great experience",,
,,WOW,5,,Only in Singapore..what a magical magnificent place..the dome the indoor mega gardens the light show are truly out of this world..go at night obviously and be amazed..Par excellence,,
,,Peace and tranquil,5,,"These gardens are so relaxing to walk through. So well made and maintained.
I recommend a visit here, it's great to just walk through the garden by the bay but if you do want extra the two domes are worth a visit. Know you can just opt to go into one, I don't think they have the price on their board so most people think you have to go and pay for both. But you can just do one. Enjoy...",,
,,Many Major GBTB Attractions closed in May & June 2019,2,,"Check their web site and you'll see a list of the major attractions that were and are closed in May & June, which is when we were in Singapore, and so looking forward to seeing them. They make a huge deal about having the world's tallest indoor waterfall, but that doesn't do any good when the thing is closed for a couple months. Why close so many at the same time?",,
,,Stunning!!!,5,,We walked across from marina bay sands and absolutely loved the gardens. Beautifully set out and so colorful and creative. The tulip display was stunning. Would definitely recommend to even non gardeners.,,
,,Cloud garden,5,,"Simply amazing! Great price! Wish I had more time, we had left it late due to light show. But simply amazing to wander and see the most outstanding array of plants and waterfalls! I would go back just to see this all over again",,
,,Simply beautiful,5,,"Simply beautiful gardens with lots to see. Stunning background for photos and plenty of beautiful plants to see. However, the gardens can get fairly busy during the day Experience the garden grounds at night. The colours are amazing and photos will be absolutely stunning",,
,,Crowded but with plenty of space and beautiful species from all over the world,4,,"It's a beautiful collection of plant species from all over the world; the Australia section certainly made us feel like we were home! It was crowded but the paths were very wide and we didn't have too much trouble, except when people were taking full body photos which required the entire width (however, this is only mildly inconvenient). If you're into plants and architecture, I highly recommend this place as the structure itself is amazing. Bring good walking shoes and a big water bottle as we couldn't find any water refills inside.",,
,,"Exciting , especially when you are with family.",4,,"One of the 'must-see' attractions in Singapore. There are two domes within this attraction. We first went to the flower dome during the daylight. Later by the evening, we moved to cloud forest. And spend time till night.
The flower dome is very good, but not much different from many flower gardens. It was the cloud forest that was more exciting.
There is an entrance fee for this attraction. We took gardens by the bay entrance fee including flower dome and cloud forest.",,
,,Good to spend the early evening.,5,,It's a very beautiful place to relax in the evening and sound and light show is fantastic. Seen similar attractions before and this is unique. Looking skywards while the show is on make you humble to know yourself.,,
,,What an Experience,5,,What an amazing place! The gardens were beautiful we spent a few hours wandering around. We were fortunate enough to be here when they had the tulip display. The added bonus was it was cool inside as it is air-conditioned. Definitely worth a visit.,,
,,Technology and nature side by side,5,,"We went to the Cloud Forest dome first (Tip: If you're sensitive to the cold, bring a cardigan or a light jacket). The Flower Dome was less cold but I personally liked the Cloud Forest more for what they have inside. The Cloud Forest have this walkway that circles up to the mountain. Even if you have a fear of heights, the walkway is safe and sturdy. The last and my most favourite was the Super Tree Grove light show at night. I loved the songs they used: 70s retro music and my parents really enjoyed listening to the classic songs used. It was like the trees were singing and dancing with how the lights were used during the show. Don't leave SG without seeing this! Highly recommended!",,
,,Mesmerizing,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is a top rated Singapore attraction and rightly so. The walk in and around was our most pleasant on a hot day. We approached it after a lunch at the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands. We had the tickets to the two major conservatories, the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. On the way there was a Children's garden with sprinklers that the young ones in our group really enjoyed

The Cloud Forest dome was up first and they have replicated a real mountain complete with vegetation and atmosphere in there. There are periodic cloud formations and mist with sign boards explaining every plant and bush as you move upwards. A lift takes you right to the top and you walk in a downward spiral, seeing everything from carnivorous plants to vanishing endangered species. A tall waterfall is the central show-piece of this attraction. There are audio video presentations explaining the dangers of humans encroaching on rain forests.

Up next was the Flower dome , full of colour and vigour. They have changing themes throughout the year, Tulips was the theme when we visited. There was a large restaurant at the bottom of this dome which was occupied for a private party at the time of our visit.

Apart from the two domes, many small gardens with themes like Sun Pavilion and Water Rocks can also be visited free of cost. The Skywalk is something we didn't opt for although it did look interesting. The Ice Creams and Gelatos outside the Flower dome are a must try too.",,
,,Greenhouse Wonder,4,,"Amazing architecture and structure of plants and exotic trees - fully air conditioned so it makes for comfortable viewing - does activate pollen allergies if applicable , but a good day out",,
,,Great experience,5,,Gardens by the bay is a park full of trees and plants. There are a lot of tree like structures that get lighted at night. There is a light show at 7:45 PM.,,
,,Just flowers,3,,"We were forced to enter here and pay $28 per person for both places, even when we just wanted to check out the Cloud Forest. Just flowers..",,
,,A unique garden,5,,"A wonderful collection of plants from all parts of the globe. Can be packed on weekends, but remember to stay for the supertrees lightshow!",,
,,Wonderful place to visit for all the family,5,,"For a tiny island nation Singapore really knows how to optimize itself as a top tourist destination. And, Gardens by the Bay is probably the best place on the island where individuals, couples, families and friends can visit for half a day and have a really wonderful time.

This was our first visit and it was truly incredible. We started with the Flower Dome which impressed us all, and then moved on to the Cloud Forest which absolutely blew us away, followed by the hawker center called Satay by the Bay (which was disappointing) and then on to the Supertree Grove with a musical light show that was amazing. Both the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest require payment and if you visit both then you get a reduced rate, I think on Klook they charge S$23 for each attraction and S$28 to visit both. Definitely visit both. And one more thing, both the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest are fully air-conditioned.",,
,,Very pretty at night.,4,,Worth seeing the light show in the evening. Its in the Marina Bay Gardens and that in itself is a beautiful park. It is a must and it's located next to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel.,,
,,A must visit for travellers,5,,"There is no place quite like Gardens by the Bay. I鈥檝e been here several times with different guests and each time the experience was great. The cloud forest, the super trees (not sure what they鈥檙e called) and the various themed displays are all excellent. Despite being a 鈥済arden鈥? the air-conditioned area provides excellent respite from the heat",,
,,Good evening,4,,Was an evening well spent. Make sure you enquire and time it for the light show. This happens at the open arena called super grove. Usually 2 shows at 7:30pm & 8:30 pm,,
,,Christmas Wonderland,5,,"A late post but we hope it helps! This was our best decision ever! The light and sound show at the supertree grove, the blizzard, the lovely market place, the luminaire light gates and much more. Everything was so, so, so, so beautiful. The gardens by far were spectacular and very beautiful. We could not enjoy the domes as much because of the crowd. But nevertheless, we were in awe of what we saw! This place definitely requires at least half a day, if not a full day, to enjoy all the attractions nicely!",,
,,In one word... Stunning!,5,,"Dozens of walking paths, including one above the trees in the Super Tree Grove and access to both the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. Spectacular!",,
,,A must visit in Singapore!,5,,"Don't miss this if you are visiting Singapore. Gardens by the Bay is just beautiful and you can walk around the various gardens free of charge. Flower Dome and Cloud Forest have a fee but are both highly recommended. Beautifully done and maintained these indoor garden displays and indoor waterfall are just amazing and the best part is that both domes are airconditioned so you get relief from the Singapore heat while walking around.
Finally the super tree light and music show in the evening is a must see. Absolutely loved this!",,
,,Beautiful,4,,"I started in the cloud forest which was amazing. Walking around without losing interest and the temperature inside is great.
Flowerdome..it's beautiful..but not my thing.
I left the flowerfome quickly to go to the Tree Grove. Unfortunately there was a lot of construction going on on the ground.
I didn't go up the skywalk this time, but it's for sure worth it. I can say that gardens by the bay is for sure in the top 3 must see.",,
,,Lovely walk,4,,"Beautiful well kept gardens to walk through and spend time relaxing in, away from the hustle and bustle of the town. We walked through the gardens on the way to the flower dome.",,
,,Nice at night,4,,Make sure you see the light show - about 15 mins - but don鈥檛 do it from the domes - it鈥檚 better from the walkway opposite,,
,,2nd National Garden of Singapore,5,,"A must go to Garden for locals n tourists. It's so spacious and the nightly light & sound show - Garden Rhapsody, at 7.45pm & 8.45pm is mesmerizing. Different musical line up each month and it's always a joy to catch this show.

The 3 conservatories : Cloud Forest, Flower Dome and latest Foral Fantasy showcases plants, flowers of species that span all the way from Mediterranean..

The current showcase at Flower Dome is "" Rose Romance"", till 14 July... Be sure to catch it...",,
,,Fun visit,5,,A wonderful and very carefully crafted place. Very very nice. You can spend around two hours in this place.,,
,,Worth the visit,5,,"A must see event within Singapore.

We took our family for a late afternoon visit. It was very busy with locals and visitors.

We really wanted to see the gardens by night, especially the the elevated sky walk.

Some pointers for those with young families:

- suggest getting there mid afternoon to visit each of the 2 x domes. Depending on how busy it is, can take an hour rushed per dome;
- if it is busy, prepare for mayhem. It is well organised but queues are long and depending on the time of year can be hit and sweaty;
- take plenty of water;
- plan your trip, prepaid tickets have benefits but have to be collected are the main entrance;
- the elevated sky walk, but book tickets early and be prepared to queue. If you are looking to be on the bridge at dusk, plan your timing;
- the MRT (local tube) is a convenient way to get to and from the venue;
- the local cafe and restaurants and petty good, feed the kids before queuing!

Good Luck!",,
,,More then a Garden,5,,"It as great garden with varieties flowers and plant. The light and music show around the trees was breath taken, and something you have to see.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,A must when in Singapore. Awesome and serene. Allow at least 1/2 a day for the flower dome and the cloud forest.,,
,,Magnificent,5,,The gardens are beautiful and so well maintained and it is definitely worth visiting . We also visited the domes within the gardens-well worth seeking & the light show at night there.,,
,,Great place to Visit,4,,It is a great place to visit in the evening with the greenery all around and the light show. You can spend an hour or so.,,
,,World Classic Garden,5,,So many varieties of flowers and plants from all over the world found in the one place. Very impressively maintained all plants. its unforgettable.,,
,,Cloud forest....Wow!,5,,Just amazing! So much fun and breathtaking. Spent a couple hours and enjoyed every minute. It really is unbelievable that it all hasn鈥檛 been growing there for years. And the AC was a great break from the heat.,,
,,Amazing!,5,,"We visited the Super Tree Grove, Floral Fantasy, and the two domes, the Flower Dome & the Cloud Forest.
Easily accessible from the MRT, air conditioned cafe and gift shop - a welcome relief in Singapore's heat.
The Super Tree Grove was my favourite, we returned another day to experience it at night - this was definitely the highlight!
For the evening visit, tickets for the OCBC Skyway are sold from a booth in the Super Tree Grove itself. Visiting just the Super Trees is free, but the skyway only costs $8 and is well worth it. They sell them in 15 minute admission slots, and we waited an hour for the 7.15pm ones to go on sale - this was the best time, past twilight but not yet completely dark - the views from the skyway are phenomenal.
At 8pm & 9pm, there鈥檚 a free light & music show in the Super Tree Grove, well worth sticking around for - great music & amazing light show.",,
,,"No visit Tom Singapore is complete, without a visit to these gardens",5,,"We first visited the gardens within a month of their opening back in 2012 and have been coming back most years since. They never fail to astound!..new features to discover and to be awed by how beautiful the longer established parts have become over the intervening years.

We are amazed at the foresight, the care and planning that went into their design.",,
,,Fantastic,5,,"If you visit here be sure to do so late in the afternoon as there is a light show commencing at 7:00pm that should not be missed.
The outside are is free but if you wish to visit the glass house, the price is around $40:00 Singapore dollars.
Allow at least 4hrs as there is so much to see.",,
,,Nice Gardens but Crowded and Hot,3,,"Gardens by the Bay is a nice escape from the high-rises of Singapore. Easily accessible from Bayfront MRT.
We did not do the paid domes as they were quite expensive but did do the $8 OCBC Skywalk. This was quite a good view from the canopy of the Supertrees and as it was coming onto evening a nice breeze to cool things down.
The rest of the gardens are nice also, but as they are quite extensive, getting around them in Singapore's heat can be taxing.",,
,,馃尫 GREEN CULTURE 馃尫,5,,"Very nice and refreshing to have a little green area by the bay within all this modern concrete jungle and all this heat. Great place to visit, will come back again, highly recommended.",,
,,Very intesting place,5,,Visit during the Tulip display. Many interesting types of tulips as well as other flowers. Good place to take a break from the heat,,
,,gardens by the bay,4,,made our way via MRT and spent a leisurely 3 hours in the flower and then cloud domes with great displays of flowers and plants from all over the world.,,
,,OK experience for free,3,,We visited only the free areas of the garden. The trees and other plants are fine to get familiar with. Also nice views to surroundigs. Maybe paying in would have given us more - the free areas are 鈥漥ust ok鈥?,,
,,Amazing,5,,The gardens both indoor and out are spectacular. If you like heights you will love the chance to get to the top and see the amazing views. The light show is well worth the wait too. A great way yo spend a day...or two.,,
,,An amazing place to visit,5,,I actually thought I had died and gone to heaven when I entered the Fantasy Floral Dome at Gardens by the Bay. This dome opened in 2017 is a wonderland and a must visit when at the gardens. There is a cost to visit but it is well worth the cost. The free evening light show is spectacular and is free.,,
,,Relaxing,5,,Considering the business of Singapore the Gardens by the bay are an excellent way to relax. Lovely grounds with plenty to do,,
,,Beautiful garden good place to enjoy flowers!,5,,Super pretty! You can walk over the garden and see this beautiful flowers everywhere. There are some place to sit also if want to enjoy the view. There are some bike for rent if you want to ride also in the night there are usually the musical show where the garden turns into light!,,
,,Amazing!,5,,You tend to appreciate the architecture and the serenity over here. Just strolling around amazes you. Beautiful.,,
,,Some beauty hides behind,5,,"I have been to the Gardens by the Bay a few times and always amazed by this natural wonderland. However, this time, while my daughter and her friends went inside, I decided to look at what was behind or around and walked the huge garden. Believe it or not, I made a 10-kilometer walk to see the hidden beauty and the good thing was not many people were out there.",,
,,Flower Dome is special!,5,,Depending on the season the flower dome takes on a completely different look. It was Tulips when we were there and they were amazing. I would try to go mid-week as it gets very busy week-ends.,,
,,Great family activity,4,,Gardens by the Bay is best enjoyed in the morning or late afternoon when the humidity levels subside a little. We didn't bother paying to visit the domes and we still had a fabulous time walking through the Supertree Forest before heading down to the dedicated children's water playground. We capped off the visit with a meal at Satay by the Bay hawker centre (more touristy than typical hawker centres but still great value food options).,,
,,Beat the Singapore Heat,5,,Step inside the domes to enjoy flora from all over the world! The gardens are cool and a great place to get out of the daytime heat. Walkways are easy to navigate there are places to stop and grab a snack. A place not to be missed while in Singapore.,,
,,Beautiful,5,,This is a very beautiful outdoor and indoor garden. We stayed at the marina bay hotel so it was just a short walk for us. If you like plant's then this is a must visit while in Singapore.,,
,,AMAZING,5,,"The place is beautiful at both day and night, the light show was fantastic and I would recommend getting there about 20 mins before the light show starts and try get a space standing up on the sort of balcony levels (check my photo for reference) bring along some snacks drinks beer too and make the day of it, one if the best days we had in Singapore was visiting here and the water show along with some live performances free at the esplanade",,
,,Amazing!!,5,,"The overall gardens are spectacular with fountains, flower beds, trees and lots of greenery. Take the Skyway to be 22mtrs above the ground (level of the rain forest) and get closer to the towers of the Supoertree Grove.",,
,,Not to be missed,5,,"Easy to get to by MRT or bus. Free admission, but fees for special exhibits. Lots of covered walkways added nice shade. We went during the day and at night. Excellent views from the gardens. At night there is a light and music show by the super grove trees which was amazing and fun! Lots of people come to the show. A must see when in Singapore!",,
,,Beautiful and captivating,5,,What a treasure for the people of Singapore and visitors alike. Amazing public gardens and superb show gardens in the various domes accessible for an extra fee. The night-time light show is unmissable.,,
,,Fabuloous!!!,5,,These gardens were outstanding. Allow plenty of time because there is so much to see. Everything is displayed beautifully. This was my favorite thing in Singapore.,,
,,A must see attraction,4,,A unique collection of plants with excellent landscaping.Try to avoid visiting on holidays as the question are huge.,,
,,AMAZING,5,,Was a lot more impressive than I anticipated!! When you enter the coolness and fresh air smacks you in the face and you get a burst of oxygen that revives your senses!! Well worth the money!!,,
,,Must do in Singapore,5,,"So impressed, we've intended to visit the Gardens by the Bay but not made it before. Finally did, expecting really hot but very cool inside, so it is perfect for steamy days. Fantastic collection of plants and flowers, it is huge and spectacular inside and out. The Skyway walk is very high, great views and you realise how big the complex is. The sound and light show at night is spectacular, so please we finally got there and we will visit again for Clouds which we missed.",,
,,Wow factor,5,,"Garden entry is free which includes the spectacular light and music show in the evening at the Super Tree Grove 7.45pm and 8.45pm. There is an entry fee to the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. This place is extremely popular so very busy. Cloud forest is amazing but has user friendly walkways and internal lifts for those unable to walk too far. Check before entry.
For $8 you can get an audio tour in a cart around the gardens.
The light show is fantastic. You must stay for this so go later in the day to do both.
It鈥檚 bedlam when leaving but there is a taxi rank near the exit area",,
,,Amazing building,5,,It is the number one site in Singapore. It is soooooooooooooo big and beautiful. I wish I stay there and go to the pool.,,
,,Gardens of the future,5,,"When you visit Singapore, Gardens By The Bay is a must-see attraction. They are open from 9 am - 9 pm and there is plenty to see. If you aiming for light and sound show make sure you get there before 7.45pm and go up to the skyway to see it up close. This mesmerizing show last for an hour but is really worth it. Gardens are free but there are a small fee to get up to the skywalk. Day or night this place definitely define the future entertainment and conservation with nature.",,
,,Floral Fantasy,2,,"Disappointing. Representatives working there, untrained in the way they spoke, dressed and body language. Example, 4D auditorium, after asking the audience if any of us had symptoms cited in the introductory video, the rep said along the lines ""In that case, I will allow (or permit) you to enter..."". GBTB, with huge investments in architecture, should spend on taking queues from theme parks in the US. For $24 bucks, I did not think it was value for money.",,
,,Incredible design & a must see,5,,Our group spent most of the day there & could easily have spent longer because there is so much to see in the domes but also in the general free admission area as well. The domes were amazing but also the parklands surrounding. A great day for all to experience incredible design that exceeds your expectations,,
,,Amazing,5,,We went to the Gardens and the visit was worth the entry fee. We went early and were able to wander freely round the exhibits however as the day went on it became busy. The plants and displays were excellent.,,
,,How on earth can someone think of this?,5,,"You like nature, you like flowers.... Wellthsi si a place to be. If you don't like flowers or nature still this is a place to visit to see how incredible this man made structure looks and how they have build which looks so real. You have a huge variety of flowers and plants and small artifacts to get the experience to a different level.",,
,,Lovely day out!,4,,Went to Gardens By The Bay on our second day in Singapore. Well worth a visit and all the gardens and grounds were beautiful and well looked after! Admission is fairly priced but you had to pay extra to walk on the skywalk which was annoying but not a costly extra. Good day out for families or couples or solo travellers. 8.5/10,,
,,Disappointed,3,,"Bought ticket day before for cloud forest and flower dome
When we arrived at the ticket office was told that flower dome was shut due to maintenance
They would not offer partial refund or let us go into floral fantasy as an alternative. Was told we could use our voucher to flower dome tomorrow but as I explained we aren鈥檛 here tomorrow as fly to Bali
Apart from this place is beautiful",,
,,Speechless! Avatar?,5,,"The experience is amazing. Starting for the super tress to the water cascade, to all different samples of plants and flowers
Everything perfectly organized, clean and well maintained not to mention the pristine organization they keep inside the gardens
Not to be missed!
But awaiting to see any discount in the entrance tickets or white nights or special festival days at discounted rates.",,
,,Awesomeness!,4,,The cloud forest is a must see with its awe inspiring views. Flower dome鈥檚 tulip show was great and remarkable.,,
,,Garden for everyone,5,,"Went there after hearing so much. Did not disappoint a place should see in their lifetime. A lot of thought has gone into it, should be on everybody's list",,
,,Amazing yet calming attraction,5,,"This place is impressive due to its design, scale and diversity. We were so fortunate to witness the Tulip exhibit/season. A truly unforgettable experience.",,
,,A Beautiful and breathtaking time at Flower Dome,5,,"The Tulips were beautiful. I am really impressed by the varieties of tulips. Went a 2nd time a week later, the tulips were blooming and standing tall.",,
,,The 21st Century Graden,5,,"Gardens by The Bay is a wonderful 21st century creation of human love for nature. Here the the latest scientific knowledge, human imagination and love for nature have been blended together with great harmony and thus created a perfect beauty to enjoy and share with others.
During the evening light shows added another dimension to this place, One will have a feeling ""if there is a heaven on Earth, it is here"".
Very well organised and convenient location, good arrangemenst of transports to visit this place. I would recommend this place is MUST to visit whoever is visiting Singapore.",,
,,Holland Theme with Tulips,5,,This was my 3rd visit to GBTB and this visit was by far the best. Really loved the tulip theme. The layout was very well done and the arrangements simply exquisite. It was a hit for the teenagers and the parents alike.,,
,,Gardens of Wonders,5,,"Gardens By The Bay never ceases to amaze me. Have visited the various attractions many times with family or friends, always enjoyable because it is a great place to relax, play & discover new things.
Visited the new attraction Floral Fantasy on May 20 with friends. It is a marvellous garden with many beautiful & interesting plants, planning to visit again soon with family.",,
,,"Excellent overall, but constantly having to dodge selfie-takers!",4,,"I went as a solo visitor to these gorgeous gardens. It will easily take up half a day, or the large part of a whole day if you wish.

The gardens are immaculately kept, with lots of information on both plants and ecosystems. I arrived after lunch and walked around for about an hour initially.

The domes (cloud dome and flower dome) were paid entry (I bought mine online earlier) and absolutely stunning. I chose to do these after my initial walk around mainly to cool off! Both were fantastic, but I really did feel the experience of enjoying the flowers and trees was marred by constantly dodging people taking photos of themselves. It was like the whole dome was one giant photo op. It was annoying as hell. But the flowers were lovely. The cloud dome was based on a giant indoor manmade waterfall - again photo dodging aside, excellent. The real value was in the after dome experience with a section devoted to environmental issues. I thought this was excellent.

I then headed off to a cafe in the gardens for tea, and proceeded to the excellent heritage gardens. A final walk by the giant baby statue and over dragonfly bridge took me to Marina Bay Sands to de garden for a while.

I headed back to see the supergrove trees lit up after 7pm and had a final walk around at night.

Overall an excellent way to spend a day in singapore.",,
,,Wheelchair and stroller friendly,5,,Great place. you can rent a wheelchair for the elderly and the workforce is young and helpful and eager to please. U feel at ease asking directions and questions and the process is organized and seamless.,,
,,A visit to floral fantasy,4,,Proper signage should show the way leading to Harbourfront MRT. No instructions was indicated in the web and I parked my car in gardens by the Bay and I have to pay $3 for the shuttle bus to get there. Can be improved in this transport and signage,,
,,Brilliant as always,5,,"So many beautiful flowers! Love them all! Diversity impress, especially those balls moving on the selling.",,
,,Nice and beatiful,4,,"Beatiful place to visit and check how wonderful are the nature that could saw differents kinds of flower, three on same place.",,
,,Cloud dome,4,,"I went down quite late - an hour before closing and so it wasn鈥檛 too busy which was great.

I鈥檓 not into gardens and this attraction was one of the only things I had not done in Singapore. But what they have done is just amazing. Especially looking out and seeing glimpses of Singapore beyond. It鈥檚 a really lovely attraction to visit",,
,,Flower fantasy,5,,This is spectacular. Went during day and then back at night. Always something new to see. Just love it,,
,,Shouldnt even need a review haha,5,,Lived up to its expectation! Would recommend day or night but definitely try to get to the night time light show at 7:45pm or 8:45pm. Its Free to walk around the park but a fee to go inside the big domes,,
,,Great Venue to see while in Singapore,4,,We took the tram tour of this venue because our time was limited. The area is very beautiful and worth the stop.,,
,,A Must See,5,,"Quite simply a must see attraction, the flower dome has a variety of areas with different climates and very often special exhibits. The cloud dome is breathtaking and with a serious message too. Price is reasonable, and gift shop is well stocked at all price points.",,
,,Full of nature and beauty,5,,"I love the concept of Gardens By The Bay, full of nature with an added beauty at night. Going at night made for many different photo ops, and was beautiful to see the lights. Could spend some time walking around, and taking in the beauty. A must see when in Singapore!",,
,,Amazing,5,,"It was an amazing experience on Garden by the bay.
Its approximately half day to complete both the dome and the OBDC walkway.
Do not miss the musical and lighting show in the evening.
Would advise to visit tue place around 2pm so that by the time the musical shows starts you have finished all the places.",,
,,Oh what could of been,5,,"Feel that we failed on this trip as we simply did not allow enough time. Didn鈥檛 get to see either of the two internal display areas even though we had tickets (through Singapore Airlines) but wanted to at least do the skywalk and see the light show.
We were very fortunate as we were on the skywalk when the first show started and then went for a bite to eat, (plenty of choice in the dining area for all)
After eating we then saw the show again from the ground, just as amazing.
Would suggest an easy afternoon looking around everywhere then take in the show in the evening so a minimum of 4 hours.",,
,,Not to be missed,5,,"Superb gardens, beautifully kept, lots to see and admire and so allow enough time. Don鈥檛 miss the evening light show, when it鈥檚 busy you may need to get there a bit earlier to get a good spot.",,
,,amazing place,5,,"well worth a visit best to go afternoon so you will be there when it gets dark also. Take you time to stroll around, bring plenty water as gets very hot",,
,,Amazing Place !!!,5,,Beautiful domes with excellent landscape and tree species !!! It represents most of the continents. The waterfall and walkway are amazing... One can't miss them !!!,,
,,Floral Fantasy,5,,"It was so refreshing to step into a cool and fragrant indoor floral display. You are welcomed by the array of colourful flowers so innovatively displayed with different landscape that incorporated mist, stream and waterfall. It's definitely an ideal location for photography. I liked the floral balls bobbing up and down. It is good that the crowd is controlled so that it wasn't overly crowded for photos and for one to enjoy the place. What attracted me was also the colourful poisonous frogs at the end of the garden. These are frogs not commonly seen. They are tiny and it's fun looking for them as they camouflage themselves in the tank. The highlight was the 4D ride on Flight of the Dragonfly that was so cleverly done to provide an overview of Gardens by the Bay. It's definitely a place well worth visiting!",,
,,Whatever You Want to Eat is There,5,,"Had an early dinner before the light show. Lots of kiosks serving everything from burgers to curries, plus there were loads of fish & shellfish dishes on offer. The fish dishes were amazing. Mix & match worked well for us and gave us a chance to sample different dishes. The seating area was a bit like a cafe but we did not care as the food was to die for.",,
,,Mr. Adrian Lee,5,,"Went and visited Gardens By The Bay, was amuse and amazed by their design and architecture of the trees and lightings design. Seems like 3D feeling of going to the futures of what the world will be like 20 years ahead. Love The Beautiful ambience and surrounding so smoothing and the greenery give a sense of inner peace and brighten the day with a smile 鈽猴笍truly amazing 鈽猴笍",,
,,Not to be missed!,5,,"So we visited in December 2018, before Christmas Day. We had been meaning to go for some time and thought there was no time like the 鈥榩resent鈥?

We arrived first thing in the morning around 9am to miss the crowds. Definitely a good idea as an hour had gone past and there were certainly a larger flood of crowds.

We visited the following:

1. Cloud Forest Dome

2. Supertree Grove and OCBC Skyway

3. Flower Dome

Our favourite was the Cloud Forest. You enter a temperate climate dome (a cooling break from the usual Singapore equatorial temperatures) and are welcomed by a huuuuge indoor waterfall. You鈥檒l reach the top of the dome and then make your way down via bridges and internal stairs. A lovely variety of flora and fauna to interest both old and young.

The Supertree Grove and Skyway is what you would normally see on Singapore鈥檚 tourist literature. We had to buy a separate ticket for this. A great view from the top of the skyway, looking over the gardens and the iconic Marina Bay Sands. We鈥檇 picked a sunny, blue-sky morning to get some great pics, but beware of the heat. Make sure you visit in the morning to escape the crowds. There is a limited number of persons allowed on the Skywalk.

The Flower Dome is a lovely, open space expanse. It was Christmas time so they had a Tsum Tsum Disney feature. We actually got roped into a YouTube video that day which was quite funny and embarrassing for us. Lots of varieties of plants and very interesting.

Certainly would recommend the Gardens.",,
,,Amazing experience,4,,"A must visit place where you will see how the nature has been protected and nurchered.
How the huge come has a controlled temperature in order to have the rate plants and flowers grown.
They also preach and promote to save the nature in many ways.",,
,,Light show,5,,"In singapore u can see light show concert in some place. .marina bay sands, garden rhapsody,wings of time ,etc. .this time i choose garden rhapsody in gardens by the bay and i really like this show cause we can relax and lying down to enjoy the lighting turned
For each tree which follow the rhytm of music. .show time at 7.45pm and 8.45pm",,
,,Fatastic experience,5,,"It is a fantastic experience indeed. For adults and kids. Great organization, good value for money. Splendid.",,
,,Beautiful Garden,5,,This is definitely a wonderful place to spend the day with your family. The evening light show is a must see.,,
,,Amazing gardens with variety of activities,5,,"We have visited Gardens by the Bay many times and each time discover something new. Whether your visiting the impressive huge domes, strolling through some amazing out door gardens, entertaining children at the excellent adventure / water playground watching the nightly light show at the giant trees or eating out at Satay by the Bay or the hawker centre / other restaurants there is plenty to do at any time of the day.",,
,,Beautiful display,5,,Our tour guide brought us here for the evening light and music show. It was incredible and deeply enjoyed by all in our group. Fantastic display of environment friendly light show. Those towers absorb energy during the day and use that power to light up the sky. Really something to see in Singapore.,,
,,Make sure to see the lights show!,5,,"I visited Gardens By The Bay for the first time in May 2019 and saw one of the lights shows (7:45pm and 8:45pm most days). I was incredibly impressed. The gardens are amazing on their own, but the light show made them even more enjoyable. Definitely try to see one of the shows if you go!",,
,,Beautiful gardens.,5,,Spectacular gardens with amazing facilities. You could spend a few days just looking around here. It is amazing how they manage to get so much greenery in Singapore. The light show at night is fantastic. It is also great that most of it is air conditioned. Definitely worth the entrance fee to look through the whole place.,,
,,Must see,4,,Not Disneyland but very well set up and certainly an icon of Singapore. You can walk all over and enjoy the lighted trees for free.,,
,,Futuristic garden in a city,5,,Its a must visit place - plenty to see and eat. do have good walking shoes as the place is really big!,,
,,Flral Fantasy,5,,Very nice and well presented. also the 4D show. We all love it and wish to be able to get free admission there too.,,
,,Meh,3,,"The conservatories are well done but very unnatural. There is no ecosystem at all, and the temperature, while a nice break from the heat, felt off as a habitat. More importantly, as someone who has visited nature preserves around the world, this stuff is just super underwhelming. All this messaging on climate change and I wonder how much power it takes to keep these gardens green and the lights on.",,
,,Beautiful garden,5,,Well maintained and beautiful nature. Good range of seasonal plants. A recommended place for the young and for the old.,,
,,Beautiful but not special,4,,"Perhaps a western tourist have seen a lot more than a other one. Being in tropical forest and all between to the dessert trees and flowers are not very new to me.
Creating an environment, architectural beauty's and educational is a very important and good thing to do. Especially for the children and adults who are not able to travel.
So visit them with that in your mind and enjoy the efforts",,
,,Cute,5,,One of the Singapore lovely green is gardens by the bay and one of my fav place on Earth great clean garden,,
,,Cloud Forest - Fabulous.,5,,"Fantastic experience - not to be missed. The attention to detail is just mind boggling.

We had problems working out how to get there and ended up getting a taxi. Once there we realised there is a $3 shuttle from the nearest MRT station Bayfront. It is a loop and the $3 would get you back and forwards all day. Get a stamp on your wrist to do the return trip (or all day) at no extra charge.

If you wish to dine at the Pollen Cafe right in the gardens do make a booking as only a few tables are in the shade.

If you plan to do a morning and then a late afternoon/early evening vist get the wrist exit stamp as well.

If you are traveling with Sigapore Airlines take your boarding passes for 10% discount.

The Flower Dome is also nice but nowhere as good as the Cloud Forest - which is full of flowers anyways.

Final trick - do check online for opening hours and days of being open. There are some bizzarre items - like closed on a Tuesday if Monday is a public holiday. There are also closed for maintenance days

Enjoy!",,
,,Growded,4,,Many people like to visit the gardens so sometimes it is hard to get your own nice view yet it is most definately worth a visit.,,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,What a magical place! Beautiful place to visit. We took our time and spent hours there. It鈥檚 a must do whilst in Singapore,,
,,It鈥檚 ok,4,,"The day we visited we couldn鈥檛 do the sky walk so I do feel like I would have been more impressed if we could.

It was too hot to wander the gardens outside so we really just did the two dimes.

I loved the cloud forest as the orchids were amazing and the high walk really impressive. I could take it leave the flower done.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,Lovely gardens and beautiful lightings at night. The view of the Marina Bay Sands at night is absolutely amazing. We enjoyed the laser show as well which is around 7/8/9 pm three shows per day,,
,,Flower Fantasy,5,,Lovely experience and very well done with organisation and the garden is beautiful. Love the dancing flowers,,
,,Would totally come again,5,,"The whole park will blow your mind. If you love greenery, flowers, anything related to the outdoors then this is a must visit destination. It isn鈥檛 like your typical garden with a couple different flowers here and there. There are thousands of different plant species from around the world.

There are tons of things to do and it can take a whole day if not days to observe everything.

I don鈥檛 know if I can visit another flower park and not feel underwhelmed...",,
,,Amazing!,5,,This is one of Singapore鈥檚 must visit destinations. The Cloud Dome and Flower Dome are just amazing. It is a huge area so allow plenty of time and wear comfortable shoes! Really enjoyed our experience and would highly recommend a visit.,,
,,"Nice gardens, views and food",4,,"Enjoyed the skywalk, Satay by the Bay food, and the evening lightshow. Worth a visit, best to combine with a stop at the top of the Marina Bay Sands.",,
,,Underwhelming,2,,"It鈥檚 a great reclamation project and I understand why the residents of some of Asia鈥檚 biggest concert jungles would find it impressive, but I found the gardens rather depressing. Stiffly organised and littered with high priced attractions it left me cold. The best thing we did here was eat at satay by the bay, interesting, reasonable prices and good seafood.",,
,,Great Garden,5,,Awesome view and experience! We really enjoyed the fun in the garden. Fantastic! Looking forward to come back again!,,
,,Top gardens in a garden city,5,,"Don't miss these gardens , free if you leave the Flower Dome & Cloud Forest for another time, returned the next evening for free light & music show on the Supertree Grove",,
,,Great experience and lots to see,5,,Great experience the cloud mist mountain was great and lots of lovely plants and flowers to see from all over the world,,
,,A unique experience,5,,It is recommended by all travel blogs and after visiting the gardens by the bay I can understand why. A unique experience and if you do nothing else in Singapore you should visit this monumental engineering feat. I recommend you take some time to explore the many areas that make up the gardens and try to get your mind around what it would take to set up and manage this facility. Truly a must see at night and in the day time to get the different perspectives of what I would regard as a major tourist attraction.,,
,,Well worth doing,5,,"A must do. The conservatories are excellent, whilst the 鈥渢rees鈥?and skywalk offer amazing views. The facility is very well managed. A very enjoyable morning",,
,,Wonderful,5,,Absolutely a must in Singapore . What a wonderful experience to have in the middle of a city . It鈥檚 intended showcase of sustainability is amazing and though provoking .,,
,,Gardens by the Bay at night,5,,"We took a taxi down to see the 7.45 pm light show, absolutely brilliant, then we walked over the Helix bridge to watch the 9 pm laser and water show by the Marina Bay Sands hotel. Picked up a taxi by the Fullerton hotel and headed back to our hotel. Lovely evening.",,
,,Flower Fantasy and Tulipmania,5,,"Lovely, serene, blessed and beautiful feeling after viewing the magnificent flowers display! Our family had enjoyed every bit of the visit!",,
,,Awesome Garden!,5,,"Love the cactus, flower festival -Tulips and different kinds of plants/flowers. Good to see it at day time. And, has different aura at night because of the lights.
Outdoor area is another story... great!

Crowded as it鈥檚 Friday. AC inside the Dome is too cold for me... bring shawl or lite jacket if you plan to stay inside the dome for a while.",,
,,Fabulous,5,,"This place is absolutely fabulous, lots to see and well worth a visit. Entrance fee is very reasonable. A must to visit.",,
,,Enjoyable visit!,5,,Relaxing and cooling while at Floral Fantasy which makes your trip enjoyable. Nice water falling design combined with the colours... Thumbs Up!,,
,,Best light and music show,5,,"We were blown away by this fantastic show. Wondered why so many people were lying on their backs and after the 15 minute show I knew why. You could not take your eyes off the trees(ha ha).

A must do if you visit Singapore. Although allow time for the traffic jam in getting out of there.",,
,,Fabulous free oasis,5,,"You can pay for the domes & walkway which are themselves great experiences, or you can just enjoy the whole gardens for free. An absolute gem in the heart of Singapore.",,
,,Best part of Singapore,5,,"This was the highlight of my holiday. We done the 20 minute tour bus, Clouds and Flower room. My favourite was the clouds room with the beautiful waterfall. Such a special place and done truly well. My favourite part was making everyone aware of the climate change to save the planet. If you head to Singapore please do not miss this opportunity!",,
,,Stunning!,5,,"Such a beautiful place and well worth a look.
Allow at least 3 hours, we visited during a 24 hour lay over and 3 hours gave us a good look at the two main domes (there are a few ticket options depending on what you would like to see), if you want to do the whole thing then start early as it is huge!
There is a 4D experience a shuttle service and plenty of interesting things along the way.
Well worth the money as is can be a full day's entertainment.",,
,,Fantastic experience to visit gardens by the bay,5,,Went there together with my parents and they enjoyed it so much that they would love to go back on their next visit,,
,,Time out,5,,So much thought and hard work has created this beautiful place. A lovely peaceful setting so you can wander round and appreciate the varieties from around the world. Amazing to think that if we don鈥檛 do something soon a lot of these plants will be extinct in their natural habitat. Thought provoking,,
,,City of light and Greenery,5,,"Singapore is the city or light, fountains and flowers.. You get to see that at Gardens by the bay.

Must visit atttration in Singapore, one should plan to go in the evening to experience the beauty of light, fountain and flowers. Cloud dome abd flower dome ate aswome. However light show of supertrees is one of the wonders of the world. Enjoy your holidays in Singapore",,
,,Escape the heat/humidity,4,,"My husband and I visited two of the conservatories to beat the heat. The temperature in the flower and cloud forest dome was lovely and cool.

So many flowers and plants to see - and presented so beautifully. There are so many flowers I saw that I want to try and grow back home!

The mix of real and fake flowers in the cloud forest was interesting - perhaps this is for kids?",,
,,Singapore stop over,5,,This is a great place to visit especially at night for the light show. There are lots of ways to get there we did a hop on hop off which works,,
,,Don't Miss the OCBC SkyWalk,4,,"It's a nice place offering lots of free spaces. Especially for families with young kids, they have a lot of room to run and play.

The highlight of our experience is the OCBC Walk. We were lucky enough to have it during the music and lights show. Half of the show we were on the ground and half we're above. I would suggest the same for others to see the different views.

In my opinion, it is best to explore the sky walk at night. During the day I do not think there is much of a difference between a view of the trees from the ground or the top.

We went on a Monday, but the ticket queue was very long. Better buy your tickets early.

Don't forget to bring a jacket or shawl as it is cold in the Flower Dome. Prepare to walk if you plan to explore the whole place, from one garden to another.",,
,,Awesome - a must see in Singapore,5,,"I'm not your 'flower show' type but based on reviews decided we had to go and see the Gardens on the Bay. It is truly amazing and I'd defy anyone to review it badly. It is a no expense spared attraction and we spent 4 hours wandering the pavilions and gardens and were incredibly impressed with how well it has been done. Suggest getting the package to include the pavilions, skywalk and audio tour. We did each but on separate tickets.",,
,,Very nice place to go if you like flowers,5,,"Other than the weather very hot & crowded, everything is great A distance from the MRT so it is better to take the shuttle at $3 to beat the heat Super worth it.",,
,,Visit to Gardens by the Bay and Floral Fantasy,5,,It was awesome. The floral fantasy is a must see thing with beautiful landscape and waterfall. The 4-D sensory ride was a great experience.,,
,,Must see!,5,,Gardens by the Bay is a must see stop while visiting Singapore. The flowers were amazing. The rain forest was spectacular. I could have spent the whole day!,,
,,A great way to spend an afternoon,5,,This is a great way to spend some time in Singapore. There are many interesting areas to walk - including a fantastic tree-top walk! - and lots of great food. Satay by the Bay (on property) is reasonably priced and offers a lot of variety in an upscale hawker environment. Definitely worth wandering around even in the hot Singapore sun.,,
,,Lovely afternoon!,5,,Nice but the additional entrance costs mount up! There are water fountains by the central block for topping up on a hot day!,,
,,Amazing,5,,Well worth a visit - see the sound and light show two performances daily - free entry. Visit the domes and do the sky walk. Not too expensive but well worth a visit - plenty to see and do. Would highly recommend and visit again,,
,,A must see attraction,5,,This is definitely a must see and an attraction for all ages. It is free and we attended the 8:45pm show. Picture a beautiful garden that comes to life at night with music and a light show that is so much fun. The show goes for 15 minutes although you can wander around the gardens for as long as you like. The photos will not do it justice.,,
,,Must see,5,,Amazing engineering spectacle. Light show over rated...see at night only w regular lights. No charge. Can walk to from cruise terminal.,,
,,Fabulous gardens!,5,,"The moment I entered Floral Fantasy, I feel like I'm in a fairy world. As if Im seeing little fairies are waving their wings and flying through the flowers kindom. It's unbelivably fabulous flowers garden! It's so fantasic and colorful and filled with rose smells. My mom, daughter and I all enjoyed ourselves so much! we have taken plenty of beautiful photos with different kinds of flowers. We enjoyed viewing all kinds of beautiful flowers in different design shapes in the cool air and feel the breeze touching our hair... Somemore, it mimics the forest feel with water fall effect and small stream flowing through. It's amazing!",,
,,ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL!,5,,A must visit for anyone going to Singapore. The Gardens are absolutely stunning! A morning well spent!,,
,,Wow!,5,,"You hear stories but until you see it, you cannot fully comprehend it. The Singapore government have done an amazing job. The kids area is amazing! Water park and all for the kids. The trees and plants are so well laid out, it's a great place to stroll through and enjoy nature at its finest. The 2 greenhouses are absolutely stunning! The light show at night is a great watch also.",,
,,Flora Fantasy,5,,It is a very beautiful place with lots of lovely flowers. A good place for photo shoot. The 4-D show about the flight of a dragonfly was also very amusing and fun.,,
,,wonderful experience,5,,"We visited cloudy forest, flower dome and floral fantasy, very special designs,amazing views, my child wants to be there everyday!",,
,,Fab!,5,,This place is amazing by night! We visited the gardens specifically for the light show. The shows start at 7.45pm and 8.45pm. Best to get there a wee bit early to pick your vantage point. The show was fantastic and afterwards we went to the cafe for a bite to eat and some drinks. Highly recommended.,,
,,Best Aircon in the world,5,,Simply fabulous experience. Beautiful and inspiring and so cool in the muggy heat of Singapore. Great way for the weary traveller to enjoy the sights. Watch out for families taking photos and selfies . They do it by the thousands. Saty to the evning for the music and light show. Worth the wait.,,
,,Quintessential Singapore! 馃尯,5,,"Easy to spend an entire day here, walking slowly taking in all the different areas and sights. This really sums up Singapore, exceptional gardens with magnificent views of skyscrapers and attractions. Staff are super polite and helpful. Recommend going early afternoon and staying into the night. Loved the OCBC Skyway and Supertree Grove. Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are even air-conditioned! Smell is delectable and memorable. Highly recommend.",,
,,Man made Nature,4,,"I must say I am impressed with all the mega structures erected to house all the exotic fauna around the world.

I used to run along the vast stretch of gardens and empty grass land that is now so dense with a man made forest.

It is certainly a place to visit, just once or twice .. I Guess.

Looks good from Marina Bay Sands SkyPark thou",,
,,Rooftop,3,,"Had a view from the rooftop of marina Bay sands restaurant. A nice view from the top, pretty sure it's nice from inside.",,
,,Gardens by the bay,5,,"Totally amazing experience. Beautifully done. The cloud and flower domes, were definitely worth seeing. The free light show at the super trees was unbelievable.",,
,,Awesome place,5,,"Went with family and were amazed by the magnificence of this place. It is usually very crowded, so better to keep enough time to cover the entire place. Also, it is advisable to visit in the evening and wait till the light show is over. Close to MRT, you can also get taxis easily although the queue is long",,
,,Most beautiful ever,5,,"Every season has a theme, this one was tulips. The displays of tulips along with hundreds of other blooming plants was so much a dream...waterfalls and exotic plants everywhere. Even a several hundred year old tree is there.",,
,,Wonderful experience,5,,"We absolutely loved everything about the gardens, the flower dome was beautiful and the skywalk was absolutely amazing the views were stunning, obviously if you鈥檙e afraid of height it wouldn鈥檛 be for you, as you are so high, we did see a few people struggling with it .we definitely recommend visiting the gardens.",,
,,Stunning gardens with lots to see!,5,,"Most people come for the main attractions (Supertree Grove, Cloud Forest), but I must say even on itself the gardens are absolutely worth a visit. They are free to enter, open at all times (AFAIK), and the territory is big enough to spend half a day exploring. There are beautiful lakes, fountains, sculptures, elevated walks, and of course lots of trees and flowers! And while the crowd is focused on the aforementioned areas, most of the gardens are quite spacious otherwise. Areas further away from the bay were mostly empty when we visited. And we haven't even covered it all, the territory is pretty big. We will be back to finish!",,
,,"fantastic, great value for monet=y and so easy to get to",5,,"amazing place, properly the cleanest tourist attraction we have ever been to. it is in 2 incredible armadillo type glasshouse which are huge and very well built, they are very cool inside, i say this because i thought it was going to be the opposite - hot - due to the plants in there, but no, very cool. the displays are just fantastic and so well done, we strolled around the 2 building for around 4 hours and was amazed by all of it. all for 23 singapore dollars each - about 拢13. we took the underground straight to it and a short walk from the station. well done Singapore",,
,,Good Day Out,5,,Make sure you visit both indoor areas and use your Singapore Airlines boarding pass for extra discount,,
,,High Tea with a great view of Singapore.,4,,"Made the decision for my very first high tea experience for SGD$38/pax at 1500hrs. (+sgd$5 for free flow of coffee/tea, all prices excludes service charge & tax.)

Definitely got the best view in the restaurant as the Marina Bay Sands is just right above my head! All the pictures taken are definitely insta-worthy! And the free access to the Garden Dome, is definitely worth it!

Service staff on 15 May 19, 1500hrs, was really courteous and polite. Adheres to requests almost immediately and a big thumbs up to the service crew! Job well done! :)

Savouries in the high tea menu was good especially the lotus chips.

However, one star down due to the desserts. Desserts are way to sweet even for a person with sweet too like me. Can only taste nothing, but sugar.

Overall experience is good, ambience is VERY good. Please remember to put on sunblock as the Pollen might get really sunny when the light enters in the dome.

Service crew did a very good job, puts up a big smile on the face and very attentive to requests.",,
,,The Bay of Colours with exotic species and superb architecture,5,,"Do you ever think you have been to a truly enchanted fantasy? Well, this is the place. You can purchase package tickets to go for the two different places (find out more yourself) that you do not want to miss. A beautiful place that you could view the rainforest and at the same time the high rise colours tree, mmm the name ""Gardens By The Bay"" as mentioned with relaxation and some truly experience when you actually went in there. Guess no more how you can feel and what you can see, try yourself and get there to experience this wonderful place!",,
,,Must visit,5,,The best and also the awarded property singapore has one must visit can puschase the tour online will cost you cheaper i bought it from a indian sight mmt,,
,,Overseas friend came to visit,5,,"My third time here in 6 months, enjoyed it. Always beautiful and clean. Some parts may be a bit too wet and steep and may be less suitable for folks with mobility concerns.",,
,,Tulipmania,4,,Love the annual display of Tulips. Would like to see annual display of roses too. Wish the staffs are more stringent on the visitors who like to touch the flowers display.,,
,,Don't miss it,5,,"Truly an amazing visit. Would highly recommend to anyone. Make sure that you stay for the Super Trees show in the evening,",,
,,As good as Kew gardens,5,,"Really well laid out and well worth a visit. Inside the domes the temperature was cooler than outside and easy to walk around. Lots of colourful plants with good explanations to origins, uses, etc.",,
,,Feast for your eyes,5,,So many colours and different things to do. So much to see. So many lovely flowers and colours. You need to want to walk around. There are shuttles but to really experiance it then you need your walking shoes on. Can get quite hot and humid so have plenty of water and rest breaks. Lots of photo opportunities. A pleasant day out for all and caters for all. Great views from here.,,
,,Not worth for tourists,2,,I hope this place has been designed for locals to see the plants/flowers in cold climatic regions. Indoor AC temperature maintained grown Tulips and other species of plants/flowers. Didn't feel it was worth a visit having traveled from UK and already been to Keukonhof tulip gardens.,,
,,Tantalising your Senses,5,,"Couldn't Agree more, one of my favourite places in Singapore!
I was extremely impressed when I first visited this beautifully uplifting Garden when it opens its doors officially in 2014!

#Great Dating HangOuts

We chance upon a young lady who was standing with a board stating guided tours, i was like yes we would like to learn more and guess what they are mostly volunteers.
She was brilliantly knowledgeable and could answer to all our weird queries without making a face not even for a moment!

Personally, I would strongly recommend spending some time on a guided tour if you happen to see one, as you will gain more take-away knowledge instead of just clicking pictures and not having to even read what's written!",,
,,Not to be missed,5,,"Always a must visit no matter the Seasons ( hot / hotter). May get too crowded at times in the forest exhibit due to the lift. Apart from that, everything else is just amazing.",,
,,A must see,5,,"We have visited smaller versions of this in the US but this place is stunning, especially the Cloud Forest. We tired out before exploring the whole complex and amazingly had the best food of our trip at the Supertree food mall. The Vietnamese lemongrass chicken was great as was my wife's sushi. So much for the overpriced and highly rated restaurants we visited and were disappointed with.",,
,,"Amazingly beautiful, awe-inspiring",5,,"We loved this place so much we went back again the following day. Fabulous gardens and brilliant engineering, and the evening light show was wonderful. Good choice of places to eat, and the cloud forest dome is magnificent. Highly recommended.",,
,,Just beautiful day and night,5,,We visited the gardens both during the day and the evening. Of course the world famous light show accompanied by classical music was amazing. But also during the day the massive greenhouses full with tropical fauna and flora as well as the massive impressive in door waterfall was so impressive. A must see!,,
,,Beautiful and clever,5,,"We bought tickets for both dome's in the gardens (cloud forest and flower dome at $28 pp) and it was so worth it, the cloud forest is so clever creating a high mountain altitude and you can walk down the very high walkway past the waterfall. The flower dome had 'tulip mania' on when we went with a big section just for Dutch flowers and tulips but it was all very colourful and nice.",,
,,You will get bored pretty soon,3,,"Although is interesting to see thousands of cactus and trees from different places around the globe, you will get bored latest after one hour. It is pretty crowded and you list be a plant lover to spend there more than an hour.",,
,,Amazing,5,,What a place! Such an eye opener when you go through Cloud Land in regards to Climate Change! Did Cloud Land and the Flower Dome then the free bus tour around the rest of the Gardens. To much for us to do in one day and a lot of walking involved which did aggravate my Mums sore knee. I would take it over 3 days if possible! My Mum and I did come back very inspired to get back in the garden!!!,,
,,Must see in if you are in Singapore,5,,"Wow, this place is amazing. So much to do and see. The cloud forest, flower dome , super tree and skyway are stunning. Make sure you do the skyway light and music show at night.",,
,,You must go and see,5,,Also if you come to singapore not for the first time... you have to go and see it. It is really unbelievable.... Better at the sunset or you will 鈥渄ie鈥?for the heat ...,,
,,"Great gardens - beautiful, well maintained, and amazing design",5,,"The Gardens By the Bay are well worth the visit. The Flower Dome itself is amazing architecture and then add the flowers and plants. While we where there they had a tulip exhibit, in addition to the regular exhibits. The Cloud Forest had great water falls and plants. There is a lot to see in Singapore, but recommend this as part of your visit (and I am not normally a big plant guy)",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"Visited twice. Once during the day when we saw most of the beautiful gardens. Then, the following evening for the musical light show. Fabulous!",,
,,Impresive Gardens !,4,,"My husband and I were there all afternoon watching the amazing gardens,during day theres lots to see as they have also special areas with forest, orquids, waterfalls etc .. the design of the gardens is so nice and be sure you could get beauyiful pictures with a ton of flowers if you visit it in april ..BTW the tulip area is just amazing and it includes a wind mill and a small holand house surounded by the most wonderful tulips .. if you stay until the sum goes down you will see the atmosphere changing as there are the most famous trees onstructed that will make u azed with its lights .. definitely its a spectacle that would make you feel like in a movie .. the staff all around is friendly and the price is mot bad .. you can purchase also the small train service to get to the cave and waterfall .
Dong miss this spot while you are in Singapore!",,
,,Fun but busy visit,4,,"We went in the early evening just as it was getting dark.

The place was packed a bit too much for my liking but this was probably tocatch the light and music show.

Super tree grove was stunning and we walked around the gardens which were nice too. We wanted to do the walk along the skywalk but the line was long and were advised the wait time was probably an hour and half before even getting close to entering. We decided to leave it. I wish we had time to go back in the day time when we would have more time to do everything and visit the conservatories as well. For our next visit.",,
,,Gardens by the bay,5,,One of the attraction of Singapore there are lots of stuff for children to see and enjoy those are flower dome and cloud forest it's like we are in the heaven . Words are not enough to explain the beauty if this place . Another attraction is laser show which starts at 7.45 pm.,,
,,fantastic place,5,,So much to see in flower dome and cloud forest as well as the gardens. The sculptures in the gardens made it come alive and added so much more to hold a persons interest,,
,,Another Wonderful day at the Gardens,5,,Been to Gardens by the Bay a few times already. Truly a world-class attraction with special special Super Trees and nice flora and fauna,,
,,Highlight of Singapore,5,,"Gardens By The Bay area was fantastic, and exceeded our expectations. I would highly recommend to check out the Cloud Forest and the light show in the evenings at the Super Tree Groves. An absolute must do in Sinhapore! It is a little touristy, but worth a visit.",,
,,Fabulous!,5,,"This is one of our 鈥渕ust see鈥?place in Singapore, next to Jewel Changi. Be prepared to do some walking (tram is also available but only to go around the park or take you from the entrance to the domes). We first took the audio tour which takes you around, this is an important & informative tour as you learn a lot as well as see lots.
Going inside the domes is a walking tour. The domes are comfortably cool and lots of benches for you to sit & rest. If you love flowers, they鈥檝e got them all here.
Don鈥檛 forget to bring your cameras & water bottles.",,
,,Beautiful and spellbinding,5,,"We visited the first full day we鈥檙e in Singapore and had walked here from our hotel in Clarke quay via the river, so through the financial district and over the helix bridge (that is a beautiful bridge and a sight to see and wonder at). It was mid afternoon when we arrived, and if we had our time there again we would have gone much earlier, only because there is so much to see. We bought tickets for both the floral dome and the cloud dome and both were spectacular! Although the cloud dome was our personal favourite! Once outside the snack stall was surprisingly cheap for a tourist destination. We then walked through into the gardens to see the super trees, we decided to do the skywalk between them and couldn鈥檛 have time it better as it was sunset whilst we were up there (7pm in May) we then discovered that the light show was on at 8pm so we sat with everyone else on the floor and awaited and fun and lively light and music show set around the super trees, it was free and fun to watch and sing along with. We then walked back to our hotel ( at this point I think we were mad on jet lag, given how far we had already walked ) we wish we had had more time so we could explore the gardens around the super trees as even in the dark these looked beautiful and with plenty of interest. We lived Singapore and are intending to visit again - we will definitely be coming back to the gardens!!!",,
,,Fascinating scenery with vibrant colours,5,,"We entered this dome with breathtaking view of different colours of plants and flowers. My favourite part of the garden is the cactus section. They are arranged beautifully and l learnt a few of their different names too. We learnt different plants from different countries and whats interesting they are set in the country's mood and atmosphere as well!
Overall is a great place for photo taking and great escape from our humid weather.",,
,,LOVED IT,5,,"beautiful, amazing, special the light show in the night, wait until the last trip to go up, it wondeful",,
,,Leisure trip,5,,A beautiful place to visit the Nature love. Amazing infrastructure with well maintained n good crowd control. A must place to visit,,
,,A must see,5,,The gardens by the Bay is definitely the highlight of Singapore. Allow for a good few hours here to see it all and there is quite a bit of walking involved in order to see all that is on offer. There are two domes which you can visit and they close at 20h00.,,

Your heart goes up many notches as u enter this delightful place lined with beautiful flowers and mobile flower balls displays. Gently soothing music playing in the background and the water falling , pine tress add to the drama.
Before exiting , you are treated to a slightly under 15 minutes 4-D movie 鈥?Flight of the Dragonfly 鈥?
An interesting experience !
No worries about overcrowding as they allow visitors in only on the hour .
Well organised indeed and value for money",,
,,Just awesome.,5,,"We spent hours in the gardens and visited both the cloud forest and the flower dome. Both were incredible and would rate highly on my list of things to do again.
The super trees are amazing and the light show that takes place each evening at 7.45pm and 8.45pm is definitely worth catching.
Great place to visit. Highly recommended.",,
,,Fantasy as it is,5,,Our main visit is to the Floral Fantasy. It is really worthy of the name and the price at the promotion rate!,,
,,A Must See stop in Singapore,5,,"We had such a beautiful afternoon spending with friends to view and take in the awesome numerous species of plants,flowers, shrubs and trees... and the atmosphere at this place is so so interesting.",,
,,A MUST-SEE WHEN IN SINGAPORE,5,,We recently had a stopover on our way home from Europe specifically to visit these gardens which were not there the last time we stayed. They are well worth the time and money. The general gardens area is free to enter and consists of several different garden types but the real stars are the domes. It costs S$28 per person to go through both domes. We spent hours exploring these domes which are magnificent. One has different gardens from around the world and the other is called a cloud forest with a huge waterfall taking centre place which you can walk around and through. If you have any interest in gardens this is a must see.,,
,,All the view and flower are nice.,5,,All the view and flower are nice. All the locations are nice views.We can spend all the times in the garden.,,
,,Beautiful,5,,"Free to roam around the stunning outdoor gardens with plenty of different fauna to see. Can provide incredible views of the city skyline. The domes itself are paid entry but definitely worth at least once, especially the cloud dome with it's amazing indoor waterfall. 100% worth a visit.",,
,,Amazing indoor plant display,5,,"The two air conditioned indoor domes contain a multitude of plants from all over the world. At the moment there is a beautiful tulip display. In the other dome be surprised by the indoor gardens and waterfall.
Outside is a lovely park with various statues and the tall artificial trees that light up to a marvellous sound display at night. A wondrous attraction not to be missed.",,
,,Beautiful attraction,5,,"This is my 2nd time at Gardens by the Bay, my husband has never been before but we were both surprised at how beautiful the gardens were.

The ticketing staff were friendly and helpful in explaining to us the different ticket types available for us. We opted for the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. We wanted to do the Supertree OCBC Skyway but we ran out of time.

The most useful part were the lockers! As we were transiting, we had our heavy backpacks with us and as it was quite warm/humid, we didn't really want to lug around kgs of stuff so we were able to store them in lockers for S$4.

Facilities were very clean and the dome and forest was air-conditioned which was very refreshing as it was quite humid outside.",,
,,A week would not get you seeing everything,5,,What an amazing Gardens and innovative achievement. Spent two days here plus came back in the night for the light show in the tall trees. Started with a visit to the Fantasy Garden and 4D film of the flight of the dragonfly. Amazing!!! Will come back to Singapore just to see more of these spectacular Gardens.,,
,,Great place,5,,Go at night and enjoy the beauty and the light show. Happens around 730 each evening and lasts for around 15 minutes,,
,,Absolutely must visit in Singapore,5,,"Gardens by the bay is awesome!! You seem to be in a movie, the attracitons: flower dome, cloud dome and Ocbc skyway are awesome. It is worhty to visit at the noght also, to see the colors and the music show, daily!",,
,,Great place,5,,Really nice place and a lot of attention to detail. Can get busy at night though. Defo worth a visit when in Singapore.,,
,,Trip to New Zealand and Singapore,4,,Was recommended to visit the gardens by our hotel we chose to walk which was hot but worth it. Some superb structures and planned gardens well worth a visit.,,
,,Amazing artificial tulip garden and cloud forest,5,,i was amazed the way dutch tulip garden and cloud forest are structured and maintained at gardens by the bay and kudos to the tourism board,,
,,Amazing 馃槈,5,,Family-friendly... If you are nature lover this is the best place to visit. Eye-soothing. We had a great time馃槏,,
,,Gift shops ruins the experience,2,,"My husband and i were in the flower and the cloud forest. We enjoyed very much the 2 places : architecture, plants, flowers, signage, design...
Also the last 2 rooms in the theatre of the could forest: videos about human pollution / destruction/ exploitation.. (sponsored by ST engenering)...
That was perfect to end with the kind of message... you can think about 芦 what can i do for a better eco world ? 禄
But just after the 芦 reviews electronic kiosks 禄 you arrive in a GIFT SHOP : world of plastic, where you can buy orchidea flower emprisoned in resin...
Furthermore, the bar just outside will provide you single plastic box for your hotdog",,
,,Awesome,5,,"Just stunning with lots to see and do with or without kids. Must do鈥檚: Skywalk Domes .... both Cactus garden Kids water feature Great value whatever the weather and most of it鈥檚 free, excluding the domes .",,
,,"Great Experience, Rain or Shine",5,,We were here during rain and shine. Utterly breathtaking. I recommend Floral Fantasy first if you're visiting for the first time. You'll get a nice overview of what to expect. Then spend most of your time in Cloud Forest. Supertrees are best at sunset and during the night show.,,
,,Amazing,4,,Magnificent Engineering and environmentaly pleasing considering its all man made. Some of the exhibits were closed at the time we visited so missed out on a few things that looked amazing.,,
,,Absolutely magical at night,5,,We spend a few hours in the gardens and absolutely loved. At night the light show is absolutely magical. Bring a jacket with you as it's very cold inside.,,
,,Sightseeing,5,,"I brought few people from Denmark there and they love the place. As a first timer, i was always so impressed with this place.",,
,,Gorgeous Gardens,5,,Visiting Gardens by the Bay is such a lovely way to spend a day in Singapore. Even though it's hot and humid there are places to shelter from the heat. Both the flower dome and the cloud forest dome are spectacular and well worth a visit.,,
,,Something for everyone and all ages.,5,,"Glorious indoor - outdoor botanical, aquatic and sculptural gardens.
You can admire many of Singapore's iconic landmark buildings from different locations in the gardens.
A feast for the senses whether it be day or night.
The futuristic 'Supertrees' transform at night into a soft neon sensation.
The scheduled light and sound show centered around the Supertrees is mezmerising and should not be missed.
Only word of caution is - crowds. This attraction is very popular and we visited during the height of school holidays so it was very crowed in the Dome Garden attractions.
We visited when there was a celebration of the Japanese Cherry Blossom time. The display was really something to see, however the crowds made it almost impossible to experience it fully. This problem may be averted if you picked a more suitable time to visit.",,
,,A definite must-see!,5,,This area is vast and encompasses so much that we split it into 3 visits. First we visited the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome which both have stunning displays and require a decent amount of time to fully enjoy them. We returned at night to the Supertree Grove for the Garden Rhapsody sound and light show which was so spectacular we stayed for a second viewing! The third visit was spent wandering through the outdoor gardens which are beautifully landscaped to showcase different gardens from around the world.,,
,,Time well spent,4,,"I can understand why people purchase the annual pass. We spent four hours there and only scratched the surface.

It is well organized, with wide paths and good signage, for easy walking.

The flowers are beautiful, and the hard scape and sculpture is very interesting; and sometimes thought provoking.

It some cases the Marina Bay Sands serves as a backdrop.",,
,,Enjoyable,4,,Always enjoyed myself walking in the Flower Dome. Love the flowers display and the many display of plants and succulents.,,
,,Floral Fantasy,5,,Most beautiful.. Ticket allocation ensured total comfort in enjoying and admiring all the floral. Very nice!,,
,,Not to be missed!,5,,Incredible outdoor and indoor spaces decked with foliage from around the world offset with awesome architecture.,,
,,Wonderful experience at gardens by the bay,5,,We went to floral fantasy and flower dome. My family is friends of gardens by the Bay and there was opening promotion for floral fantasy. We enjoyed the floral display and 4d ride. Overall very enjoyable day out to gardens by the Bay.,,
,,Must visit attraction in Singapore,5,,This is a must visit attraction in Singapore. I visited only two domes Cloud and Flower and both were very good.,,
,,Memorable trip,5,,wonderful place in singapore.. Place surrounded with artificial plants look like heaven ..light show is also amazing .. Must visit place for tourist ..,,
,,Nice,5,,We visited Floral Fantasy with family last Sunday. It's quite nice. Just the signage for Floral Fantasy is not prominent so people may confuse and walk till shuttle bus area.,,
,,Interesting and enjoyable,5,,"The Cloud Forest Dome and the Flower Dome are top of the list at Gardens By The Bay. A must see while in Singapore. Admission prices are reasonable for the domes. We spent about one and a half hours in the Cloud Forest Dome, and about 45 minutes in the Flower Dome. The Pollen Cafe inside the Flower Dome is lovely and a great place to relax. The Domes are air conditioned and it is easy to get around inside. The Cloud Forest Dome requires patrons to use the lifts to the sixth floor to access the Lost World and Cloud Forest Walkway which gives you a birdseye view of the dome's amazing flora - a truly unique botanical experience. There are also great views of Singapore from the Cloud Forest Walkway. From there you work your way down on escalators to the Treetop Walk and other attractions on the lower levels. We would definitely revisit Gardens By The Bay to explore more outside the Domes.",,
,,New Attraction: Floral Fantasy,4,,Nearly opened in April 2019. Features thematic indoor gardens displaying floral artistry. Beautiful! The attraction ends with a 4D ride showcasing the Gardens in VR. Fun introduction to what the Gardens has to offer.,,
,,Gorgeous!,5,,"What a beautiful place to wander around, pristine gardens, very enjoyable. Went up to the tree walk which was great to see the park from.
Wish we had taxi'd there as you can wander for hours, and the enclosed gardens make a nice respite from the heat with plenty to see.",,
,,Great Place to Visit,5,,"Beautiful and clean place. Great for a family day trip.Do bring a jacket along,as it gets cold in the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome",,
,,More than just an impressive Garden,5,,"If you have time only for 1 attraction in Singapore, you definitely have to visit Garden by the bay. Plan your trip early so that you have ample time for the 2 flower domes, the newly openly Floral Fantasy and marvel at the nightly Garden Rhapsody at 745pm or 845pm.",,
,,Beautiful park鈥揻ree!,5,,"First morning in Singapore, we headed to Gardens by the Bay (via MRT). The free gardens were splendid. The various arches and huge standing rocks along the paths were astounding. The Super Trees were amazing. Took many photos. Although I'm a senior, I enjoyed Children's Gardens with the water feature鈥搈uch appreciated because of hot weather.",,
,,Floral fantasy is small,3,,Floral fantasy is small. Can easily walk through in 30 mins but have to hang around to take photos to make my money worth 馃槀,,
,,Floral Fantasy,4,,1. Attraction a little short-- should try to extend 1 or 2 turns in the place. 2. 4D - should be more intense with the last dimension eg Fragrant stronger and bubble longer 3. sort of visit-- include old folks (below),,
,,Floral fantasy was amazing!,5,,"I really loved the floral fantasy. The flowers were really beautiful! If you鈥檙e a fan of fairytale like garden, this is definitely it! Minus the animals! Haha! It ended with a great 4D experience with the rose scent and gush of wind in our face as we flew as a dragonfly in the 4D theatre! Really enjoyed the experience!",,
,,Floral Fantasy is awesome,5,,It was a spectacular entrance to Floral Fantasy with myriad of colorful flowers hanging from the ceiling. The range of flowers are wide and the ambience is very cool and pleasant with the curtain of water near the poison dart frogs. The 4D simulator ride is also a good experience so overall I had a very fun time with my friend. Thank you and please continue to maintain the flowers in good condition as we saw some small part where flowers starting to turn brown.,,
,,Visit,5,,Take photo and enjoy viewing beautiful tulips Even visited Flora Fantasy many flowers lovely... will visit again :),,
,,Loved loved loved!,5,,Both museums were amazing and very different. My boyfriend liked the indoor waterfall/rainforest more. I enjoyed the botanical gardens. Everything was immaculate and so gorgeous.,,
,,Great time out,5,,Visited the gardens in the bay we had a great time it鈥檚 hard on your legs but it was a wonderful afternoon out you visit to domes you go up in the lift and start at the top.you must go.,,
,,Mind Blowing,5,,Evening sightseeing is best so you can see the light show. The views of Marina Bay and the backdrop of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and resort are awesome! Only had time to go into one of the 3 Domes so we chose the Cloud Forest...Spectacular!,,
,,Unforgetabble Vacation,5,,"My wife planned going to this Garden By The Bay. It is beautiful and beyond our expectation. We purposefully went there mid afternoon around 1:30 PM because we planned to be there until dark and see the light. Inside the dome is nice and cool. We can see many plants from many countries around the world. There are many place where you can take a great picture. It has water falls, flowering orchids, flowering plants of all kinds. At night you go outside and see the artificial trees adorned with LED lights and it changes color. There is only one restaurant there.",,

Highly recommended and must see attraction for tourists...,,
,,Great Venue,5,,"What a wonderful respite in a very busy city. Brought advanced tickets through Trip Advisor for the two domes and they worked great and a highlight of the complex. Also bought tickets for the opening of a new display called Floral Fantasy that included a 4D exhibit, also very good. You could spend hours here but of course the heat and humidity might not allow it. The domes were air conditioned so that was some relief. The displays in each were outstanding. Especially enjoyed the succulents.",,
,,One of a Kind! Unique and Beautiful!,4,,"Normally I am not a fan of the Man Made, and prefer what's natural. But this is a Man made wonder. Simply beautiful. Unique and one of a kind. Take time to enjoy the gardens as well as the surroundings. Definitely better than most of the other hyped up attractions on the island city.",,
,,Floral Fantasy Truly Fabulous,5,,In advance of our visit to Singapore we received email advice of the Floral Fantasy exhibit and decided to buy our tickets online. We were looking forward to visiting Gardens By The Bay again and were absolutely delighted by the exhibition; as it was very clear were all the other visitors. Congratulations to the staff for an outstanding floral experience. We have never seen anything like it and were greatly impressed.,,
,,Superbe!,5,,Imagine a tropical country with temperature ranging from 24 to 35 deg C! This place doesn't just offer you hot and humid weather but also cool conservatories with good variety of plants and flowers!,,
,,Wish my dog was there with me!,5,,You can spent the whole day there and perhaps have a small picnic. I wish my dog was there with me to enjoy the beautiful gardens. I loved the little river and pond.,,
,,A Must Go,5,,"There are different flower shows on display, it is seasonal. It is Tulip Festival this May. Whatever the season, if you have not been there, do give it a try. I love the two light up performance on the Super Trees in the evening - 745pm and 845pm. It's free and it is just sensational!",,
,,Superb,5,,"We visited the gardens early May and were very impressed with the display of tulips on offer at this time. The domes are airconditioned which we were unaware of at the time of going, but they are a God-send when the humidity is high! It made the whole experience of visiting the gardens so much more enjoyable! A definite destination for visitors to Singapore.",,
,,Great visit but the crowds can be a bit much,4,,"The gardens have become an iconic symbol of Singapore, so with it being 15 years since our last visit to Singapore, this was one of our first places we wanted to visit.

Ticket wise we bought our tickets for the domes on the day. We did have to queue about 30 mins in the heat which we thought was a bit of a mistake. However the queue also seemed to include people collecting pre-booked tickets so I鈥檓 not sure of the benefits of booking in advance. Probably one to do more research on!

All in all we were not disappointed. The gardens themselves are beautiful. We probably only covered a small percentage of it due to the heat/humidity but it was great to explore. I do suggest taking some drinks as you will need to take a few breaks.

The much photographed Super Trees were nice to see. We didn鈥檛 bother doing the skywalk between the Super trees as it鈥檚 not as high as we expected and to be honest the views from the Marina Bay Sands SkyPark (which we had done just beforehand )make any other raised views of the park a bit insignificant.

The domes themselves were a great visit. Both for a break from the humidity but also the sheer size, scale and experience. While we were visiting the Cherry Blossom in the Flower Dome was in full bloom, which meant that the crowds were huge. It was difficult to take any nice photos and at times hard to see the flowers for people taking selfies. The Cloud Forest however, was less busy and has a better flow to the crowds. The construction itself is incredible, but the planting makes it an amazing place to visit.

Food wise, I would recommend the Satay by the Bay. A short walk from the domes along the bay side. Not the best Hawker food in Singapore (it is a high bar after all!), but still good value and a break from the crowds. Plus you may well get to see the family of Otters on the walk ( as seen on David Attenborough鈥檚 鈥淲ild City鈥?documentary.)",,
,,A wonderful light show,4,,"Saw the supertree light show on a Saturday night. It was really hot and crowded, but the retro light show overshadowed most of the discomfort. A must see!",,
,,"if you love plants and flowers, do visit this.",4,,"a wonderfully curated set of flowers and plants with explanations. tend to be expensive if you are not very keen on seeing flowers and plants. the water fall was nice, but for me, didn't appeal as much as many of the natural waterfalls I have seen. remember the access to the two domes (the main attraction) closes by 8 PM, you need to spend at least 2-3 hours to do justice to the place. so plan your trip accordingly. best way to reach here is by a taxi or grab, with MRT you need to walk quite a bit.",,
,,Garden Oasis!,5,,"The Gardens by the Bay was our favourite place visited in downtown Singapore! Access to these beautiful gardens, which include two amazing bio-domes and the fabulous Supertree Grove (charges apply), is free! We will definitely return for further exploration of these gardens!",,
,,Holiday,5,,Lovely getaway for the day. Lots to see and do. Was a relaxing time away from the hustle & bustle of the city.,,
,,tulip exhibition,4,,there was an arrey of different types of tulips and also flowers and plants from different parts of the world,,
,,Beautiful flowers,4,,This is a must to visit when visiting Singapore. Enclosed area so you鈥檙e not in the sun! Special events like the Tulipmania 2019!,,
,,Amazing flower collection,5,,"I lone Gardens by the bay. Being in a tropical country, we get to enjoy all types of flowers of the world. That is really amazing.",,
,,For the garden lover!,4,,The gardens are beautifully manicured as you would hope and the orchids are truly spectacular. The cloud forest was my favourite the atmosphere is out of this world with so much to see in just one section. You would not believe you are in a city with these kinds of gardens. The gardens are a short stroll across from Marina bay sands.,,
,,Floral Fantasy is like a fairyland 馃槏,5,,We highly recommend Floral Fantasy for a family outing. It is a great place for family with grandparents and teens. Mesmerized with beautiful flowers and refreshing air and a wonderful experience to end the walk with the 4D show!,,
,,Amazing experience,5,,"I would suggest to keep atleast 6hrs aside for this attraction. We spent abt 3-4hrs and missed exploring all the displays. The flower dome is a bust of colours, however the supertree is icing on the cake. We experienced the light and sound show at 7.45pm and my god it's breathtaking. For 15mins songs from 80s and 90s is played with super light play. Food court and toilet are adequately placed. Keep aside 1/2day for this..",,
,,Floral Fantasy,4,,"we were very pleased to see such a grand display of flowers and show that lot of good work had been put in for this new event.
Tips: need to create new event with expertise presentation, does not need to be grand but must be specific on the theme.",,
,,Lovely Tuplis @ Flower Dome,5,,Spending family bonding time with my daughter at the Flower Dome & Flora Fantasy. Enjoyed oursevles taking many beautiful pictures with the fowers & landscapes. LOVET IT!,,
,,Floral Fantasy,5,,Went for the Floral Fantasy event and was mesmerized by it. Very nice and impressive. My daughter loved it very much.,,
,,Paradise,5,,All kinds of different species of beautiful flowers . The flower arrangement is very professionally done . The mixture of colour is gorgeous n attractive. The sweetness n colours of flowers bring joys to one鈥檚 heart,,
,,Lose yourself in wonder,5,,"There aren鈥檛 enough superlatives to describe this fantastic experience. It is beautiful, spectacular and on a giant scale. I felt that almost every step was a 鈥榳ow!鈥?
We recently visited the Floral Fantasy, Flower Dome and Cloud Forest as well as a walk through the gardens. Unfortunately the Skyway was closed for maintenance that day (1 day a month).

The conservatories are air conditioned, and an architectural marvel. The displays are by turns colossal, intricate, a riot of colour and fifty shades of green and brown; beautifully tended and nurtured. The planning and cost of maintenance must be mind boggling!

There are a number of educational areas on climate change, the environment and sustainability; interesting and informative.

There are plenty of places for food and to take a break. We stopped at Bakerzin for coffee (excellent!) and a tasty snack. There are plenty of menu items, all very reasonably priced.

We spent just the morning but you could easily spend the entire day, and then return for more!

Would like to return for the Skyway and to experience the evening light show.",,
,,Garden worth visiting,5,,Worth a visit while in Singapore. It offers an interesting and educative experience regarding the flowers-though more emphasis has been on the Tulips.,,
,,A Must Do in Singapore,5,,Beautiful displays and overall relaxing experience. I loved the forest done and all of the flowers every step in there was picture worthy. I could definetely spend a whole day there just taking in the views and little details.,,
,,The Gardens are beautiful,5,,"The gardens themselves are wonderful, but it is the nighttime show of the trees that we went for. That is spectacular. We didn't bother with the bridges/walkways above that connected the trees because we has seen them from above from the view at Mandalay Bay. We just got a seat on the grass as the time grew near and watched the show. It is amazing that they do this every night and it is free of charge! I would recommend this to anyone.",,
,,Must see,5,,I went to this part of the city really early in the morning when there was no inside. It was magical. I recommend!,,
,,Worth the Visit!!!!!,5,,"If you are in Singapore, don't miss out on visiting gardens by the bay. Its a awesome place to be. Its a place where you can go with your family as well. Would go back there again.",,
,,Astonishing.,4,,All superlatives are applicable. Relative expensive for Cloud forest and Floral Fantasy and Floral dome. But first 2 are superb. Floral dome was not so much to our liking.,,
,,Afternoon visit,4,,Nice place pleasant place to spend some time very busy not very well sign posted great food court quite far from the main attraction though,,
,,"Hey world, this is how it's done right!",5,,"I thought I dropped into the mythical garden of Eden.
Singapore doesn't build, they create and nurture. You'd be right to be intrigued by these colossal metal trees with plants growing on, through, atop and around. It's a captivating sight to behold both day and night with a sky walkway through the branches.
I was fascinated to learn that these structures serve as water purifiers, hidden solo panels generate the spectacular light shows in the evenings and much more.
Surroundings are spectacular, tropical rain forest infused with modern technology, jaw dropping skylines, themed gardens, magical domed landscapes.
Audio tour $8 gives a deeper insight of what Singapore is striving to achieve in way of less pollutants, cleaner air, eco-friendly products... hopefully they ban the plastic wrappings, bags, bottles soon.",,
,,A must see,5,,The gardens are extensive and free. You only have to pay to enter the domed conservatories or the skywalk. The light and music show on twice a night is a must see but try and get right near the trees for full effect.,,
,,Garden of heaven,5,,A masterpiece is that garden obviously. You can enjoy the nature with the absolute art of man work in there . You can take some nice pictures also . It is next to Marina bay Sands visit it .,,
,,Cloud Forest Dome for the win!,4,,"Whilst the entire gardens are lovely and the light show at night is great, the highlight for me was the Cloud Forest dome. It was amazing, well laid out and just beautiful. Whether you stay for the cloud misting or not, its a must see. The Flower dome, whilst nice has more plants than flowers so that was disappointing. But it is certainly a must see when in Singapore.",,
,,Great spot to visit,5,,"We visited GBTB with our 5 month old and loved it. It has easy acess for the pram, and a feeding room nearby which was clean. Lovely attraction with lots to see, and being air conditioner was a life saver in the humidity of Singapore.",,
,,Garden nestled in a city,5,,"Big beautiful garden opened to all with both free (most of the park) and paid (the two bio-domes and sky bridge) areas. Large spacious outdoor garden with collection of plants and herbs with setting featuring collection from various region as themes. There is also a child water play park.Situated next to the sea, the area is breezy and many park users are seen exercising and having family activities in the morning and evening. The sky bridge allow for a good aerial view of the surrounding at an affordable price. There is also free light show at the Giant Tree structures every night.

The two bio-domes, architectural wonders in their own right as they are built using pillar free structure with plenty of natural light let in, are named Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. Both these domes are air-conditioned to keep the environment optimal for the floral and plants in there. The Cloud forest features plants and flowers living in high altitude, lime stone structures as well as an interactive education area with short video filming on climate change. Walkways are built up in the air to gives the feeling of visit and viewing to high altitude ... looks very futuristic. There is a high indoor waterfall as well.
Flower Dome features flowers and plants from different countries in permanent display as well as a Themed Central Display area that features different seasonal bloom at different periods in the year like Cherry Blossom, Tulips etc. These are crowd favorite.

Food is no issue as there are plenty of eateries in the area including a hawker centre style area at Satay by the Bay with many different food stalls featuring food from different area as well as a big concentration of mini restaurants at the main area as well as the Meadows.

Within walking distance is the Marina Barrage which is worth a visit to know about Singapore's journey towards water self-sufficiency as well. After walking in the park, drop over to the iconic Marina Bay Sands for shopping and more food.

The place is well connected with MRT and buses serving the area as well. Worth a visit to this Singapore Icon.

.",,
,,Man made wonder,5,,"It鈥檚 a man made wonder - the attention to details shows . Both the domes are an architectural wonder with lovey flowers , a wide range of biodiversity and flora and fauna from all the parts of the globe. There is a sound and light show every night in the Supergrove which is a worth a visit with music and lights which leaves you awe struck. These days Tulipmania festival is going on which features wonderful tulips from Holland .",,
,,Beauty at its best,5,,"What can I say, this is definitely a must do whilst in Singapore.
The gardens are spectacular, we visited during the day. The gardens are free but you have to pay for the attractions but they鈥檙e well worth it.
The flower dome was amazing, it was definitely the highlight of our Singapore trip. The cloud forest was stunning. There鈥檚 just so much to see & do.
We didn鈥檛 get to see everything & we wouldn鈥檛 hesitate to go back.
We walked toward the Marina Sands & crossed the dragonfly bridge, it has excellent views of all the gardens.
We had a memorable day.",,
,,Evening visit,4,,This place is nice to visit in the evening. There is musical fountain show every hour. Show is nice but now happening in many other countries as well.,,
,,Too much to enjoy on one visit,5,,"Entry to the gardens is free and there is plenty to enjoy, including the iconic Supertree Grove but you pay to go into the following attractions: the Flower Dome, the Cloud Forest, the OCBC Skyway and the Floral Fantasy. The Cloud Forest and Flower Dome are particularly spectacular. The Cloud forest features many different attractions including a waterfall, a variety of sculptures, a remarkable range of orchids from ones you look at through a magnifying glass, to ones you smell , and ones you just enjoy, exhibits and films about climate change, stalagmites and stalactites, and a hidden garden. The Flower Dome features garden displays from different continents, Aloes in Wonderland and changing exhibitions - we saw Tulipmania. Floral fantasy has four different landscapes with floral art and a 4D ride where you are travelling on the back of a dragonfly. There is a wide variety of places to eat",,
,,Wow the view.,5,,Super planning of planting and development of the tree plants and flowers. Very nice and clean only staff of Singapore country I saw pleasant and smiling. Best place to visit this with family n kids.,,
,,Beautiful and you don鈥檛 have to spend much!,5,,"My main reason for visiting was to see the giant plant trees lit up at night having seen them on TV but it is so much more than that.
The gardens are easy to access via the excellent and cheap Singapore metro and admission costs nothing so it鈥檚 a great day out on a budget. The gardens are huge and have beautiful fountains and a variety of plants and themes from around the world. It鈥檚 a very peaceful location. The giant trees are stunning in the day and at night. The cost to go on the high walkway is very reasonable and worth it for great views.
If you return at night time you have a whole new experience. The place is beautifully lit and there is a free sound and light show twice a night which is amazing and brought a tear to my eye.
I spent almost two days just wandering round this place. There are plenty of toilets and access to water fountains so you really can budget. Going into the domed gardens was a bit more expensive but if you love plants you鈥檒l love it.
Can鈥檛 recommend this place and it鈥檚 ecological ethos enough!",,
,,Beautiful Gardens,4,,"Well worth a visit to the gardens - possibly would rearrange for later in the day when cooler and the lights were on. On the plus side, the views were spectacular and the gardens are very beautiful so the daylight is good for photographs.",,
,,A Singapore MUST,5,,"A delightful experience, especially the Cloud Dome. Come and see the light show each evening in the Supertree Grove, at 7:45 and 8:45pm.",,
,,You have to go and see this place,5,,"We didn't have a lot of time but we were not disappointed with this place. Plenty to see and great walks with water parks, lush gardens and Gardens By the Bay lightshow in the evenings. Would highly recommend if you are into that kind of thing",,
,,An Absolute Must,5,,"This might be one of my favorite locations I have visited around the world. Stunning, clean, pricey but not prohibitive, and child friendly! We were able to rent a stroller very easily. The food at the outdoor eating area was cheap and delicious. I highly recommend this place!",,
,,Tulips tulips tulip,5,,"Got to see the Tulips, with your eyes to experience it鈥檚 beauty .... beautifully done by GBB, Singapore 馃嚫馃嚞.",,
,,Amazing Gardens,4,,"This facility almost blows your mind, particularly when one considers the enormity of its scale and the variety of flora on display. To have a facility of this size and maintain constant climatic conditions is almost unthinkable in most developed countries throughout the world. The photo opportunities are endless and the venue is well worth the price of admission.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,"It is one of its kind place. Well organized and beautifully kept, it is a not to miss place in Singapore. But, schedule your visit in the evening (around 5 pm) so that you can see what it looks like in day light. By the time you are done both domes, night lights will be on - and that is another sight. All in all an amazing experience.",,
,,Beautiful. Worth a visit,4,,"I have been to Singapore many times but I have never ventured to Gardens By the Bay. I had pretty low expectations as I didn鈥檛 think it would be my thing. But I have to say I was pretty impressed.

It feels a bit of a trek to get there if you are walking through from Marina Bay Sands but once you are you are blown away by the beauty of the gardens. It鈥檚 done incredibly well and the upkeep and overall maintenance of the gardens is excellent. The Cloud Forest and Flower Dome are both lovely. Cloud Forest is the better of the two. The waterfall is stunning and completely awesome. The trees in Supertree Grove are majestic if a little weird. The light show was great and as it was Star Wars weekend it was amazing to see the show set to the legendary Star Wars soundtrack.

All in all it鈥檚 gorgeous and worth visiting. Gets quite busy but seeing it late afternoon / early evening is best as cooler and you get added benefit of the light show.",,
,,Great place to visit great for families,4,,If time permits good place to visit and explore but ensure good weather as we had not so good weather so could not fully explore but so great potential to visit again in future and recommend if enough time,,
,,Garden by the bay,5,,Right smack in the middle is this lovely place. Spectacular sights in the evening when the lights are on.,,
,,Should not miss if you are in Singapore,5,,The gardens are very well gathered species of plants. They are very well planned and the paths are well laid out with clear instructions and signage as to where you are and which direction you should go. The light and music show in the evening is phenomenal.,,
,,Beautiful Gardens,5,,An amazing day out with two unbelievable glass houses. Well worth a visit and good value for money. Within walking distance of the Helix Bridge and the major hotels.,,
,,Lovely day trip,5,,We did this trip in particularly bad weather which meant we couldn't do the sky walk ! But the park itself and the cloud forest and the flower dome were lovely ! Tip take a jacket as very air conditioned ! Transport too the gardens very easy and well signed !,,
,,Amazing place!,5,,"This is a wonderful place!
Everything is so perfect and very very clean.
All the gardens are wow, everything is signed, you cannot get lost.

I visited the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest.
To be honest it surprised me a lot, I love visiting parks and gardens, this is the perfection.
Staff is amazing, everything is too easy, the best thing for a visitor.
Well done everyone.

Place strongly recommended!",,
,,Amazing but quirky.,4,,"This is an architectural spectacle. The plant life is fabulous and in amazing condition regardless of the hordes touching and falling into everything they want to take a selfie with.
Weird sculptures and Stalicmites are scattered around the place. Love to have a 鈥榪uiet鈥?rule as the squealing of the masses is quite unpleasant. The plant life is great. The quality and condition of the gardens great. The light show- lots of fun. The 鈥榬etro鈥?event should encourage dancing as we plow through the disco era. Great space. Overloved tho. Signage could be improved to help people escape to the waterfront for the harbour show. Timed so you see one, and wait a good while for the other.",,
,,Magical place,5,,Visited with my family. It has 2 places to visit - Flower dome and cloud forest. Both will provide different experience. In flower dome you will get to see hundreds of flower varieties. During our visit we were lucky to see thousands of tulips as well which was out of this world. Cloud forest is huge waterfall surrounded by plants and flowers.,,
,,"Glad we went, wish we stayed for the laser show",5,,"We went with young kids on a hot day. Did the supertree grove and skywalk. Got great views on the skywalk. Took public transit. It was easy to get to. Kids played in the waterpark for a while, more so because it was hot rather than because it was a good waterpark. The waterpark was pretty plain, but it was actually supervised with attendants making sure the kids don't bend the water straws. There was a shaded area to sit by the waterpark but the waterpark itself was not shaded. There wasn't much shade in general. After the waterpark, we walked to Satay by the Bay, a outdoor eating area. It's about a 10 min walk. Food was good and reasonably priced. Make sure you bring napkins, otherwise you have to pay for them.",,
,,Awesome day with nature and technology,5,,A must-visit attraction while in Singapore. The flower dome and cloud forest are not to be missed. It can get really hot in the outdoor park in the day time. Plan your visit so that you can have time to enjoy both the outdoor and indoor parks. The technology and concept around the idea of the gardens is fantastic. It's like nature re-enacted within the concrete city jungle.,,
,,Super beautiful!,5,,"Oh my god, i was so impressive with this place from the smallest thing. I love Singapore because tree are everywhere. Even though this is not a natural place, but the way they combine everything is so smart. Would definitely come back again",,
,,Stroll in the park,4,,Good place for fresh air And walk with nature. But too hot as the sheltered area limited. Should have public water cooler and nearby toilet,,
,,Worth a visit,5,,"My daughter and I only went for the night show because we were stretched for time. We went to the late show about 8.45pm and got a great view from down by the river in the gardens. We thought we would be smart and took the subway. The train fantastic but when we got out at our stop found the signs very confusing so we walked a long way just to get out into the open then a long way through the gardens. If you are not a huge walker like me, I am 69yrs old, don't attempt it because we walked for miles. Got a great seat on the river to watch the lights and worth the walk but afterwards we had to find our way back to marina bay hotel with the throngs to get a taxi back to orchard rd. Worth seeing the lights but not advised to use public transport if you are in a hurry, might be worth getting a taxi to wait.",,
,,science meets nature,5,,it is height of imagination by creator. they have cultivated nature in its fantastic form and closed it in AC ENVIRONMENT.,,
,,AWESOME,5,,"It was a great experience going there. You have to wear comfortable shoes. If you are a plant lover, this is a must.",,
,,Lights and sound show with nature background!,4,,"Coming from Dubai and being used to the magnificent Burj Khalifa show, the Lights and sound show at the Gardens by the Bay cant stack up but it surely stands out since its against the backdrop of nature and greenery. The atmosphere and scenery while watching the show is equally refreshing and calming giving it a different experience altogether. Entrance is free. Kids loved it.",,
,,absolutely gorgerous place,5,,the place is large and clean. very green. strongly recommend the indoor gardens and light show every evening. the place is big but there is shuttle you can take (3 dollars).,,
,,Outstanding!,5,,"We spent hours here and still did not see everything. Floral Fantasy, Flower Dome, Cloud Forest are amazing. Allow lots of time and have comfortable shoes! A must see in Singapore if you love plants, crazy architecture and amazing designs",,
,,Floral Fantasy,5,,New attraction at Garden By the Bay. Beautiful flower display and landscapes! Do also enjoyed their 4D show at the end of the journey!,,
,,Fabulous,5,,"A must visit nature park on your trip to Singapore ,about $33 for person , Recommend to visit at night times .",,
,,Amazing,5,,From the time I entered this building I was able to see such a wide variety of plant life from all over the world. The tulip display was particularly amazing. Well worth visiting .,,
,,A great day out,5,,We visited Gardens by the Bay several times during our recent stay in Singapore. The park is serviced by ample places to eat and good toilet facilities. The park is wonderfully maintained and a delight to walk around and is an amazing free amenity for the people of Singapore and visitors. There are lots of open areas and some special gardens dedicated to different areas of the world. These are also two large domes and a SkyWalk that can be visited by chargeable ticket entry. We were staying at Marina Bay Sands hotel so had excellent views of the free 15 minute sound and lights show in the artificial trees area of the gardens at 7.45 pm every night - well worth seeing and attracts a lot of visitors. The gardens also has a souvenir shop. There are some beautiful sculptures in the gardens - I especially liked the huge metal dragonflies in the lakes.,,
,,You don`t have to be a Gardener,4,,"You don`t have to be a gardener to appreciate how beautiful this display is. There is a wide range of plants from different countries around the world. The centre piece, when we visited was a tulip display, absolutely stunning. Whist you are admiring the flowers you can`t help but admire the architecture of the building. It is well worth a visit, you should also visit the Cloud Forest next door.",,
,,Don't Miss Gardens By The Bay,5,,Evveryone Who travell Singapore must add Gardens By The Bay in your Travel itinerary. It's amazing place can't explain in few words. The tree walk is breathtaking and provides a great view over the park and on the Marina Bay Sands. The light show at Gardens by the Bay is amazing local time 7:45 PM.,,
,,Cherry Blossom time,5,,"As it was so hot in Singapore we decided to visit Gardens by the bay, it was so much better than we could possibly have imagined. The Cherry Blossom was in season so there was a Japanes theme. We had an amazing time and it was a shame to leave! 10/10",,
,,Be sure to go,5,,"Well we nearly didn鈥檛 go, but sure glad we made the effort, this is an incredible venue and the gardens are well done. Highly recommended.",,
,,Super duper!!!!,5,,Love everything about this place! It鈥檚 amazing and breathtaking! Love love love! Price is Sing $23 using Klook. Worth every cent! Make sure you have your camera!,,
,,Singapore's appraoch towards Nature is Fantastic,4,,"Truly amazing, conceptually and overall. Must see ! Their thought process towards conservation of Nature, animals and growing of trees is so evident. Throughout city the sightseeing points will tell you the same. You inertly start believing n want to help more here",,
,,Wonderful,5,,This place is amazing. I鈥檓 not into gardens at all but wow this was unbelievable. So much has gone into this to create what it is. Highly recommend going even you other guys who don鈥檛 like gardens.,,
,,Absolutely mind blowing!,5,,Visited the gardens and festivities during the 'Full Moon' festival during night time. Absolutely wonderful experience which will be remembered forever!,,
,,Lovely,5,,"Arrived via taxi, time your visit for the night time light show which took place at 7.45 pm. You can easily spend a good. 5 hours here even more if you wander the outside gardens. Really lovely.",,
,,Beautiful gardens,5,,"A must do if visiting Singapore , absolutely beautiful place to to spend a day (and night ). just walking around escaping the hustle and bustle of the city , plenty to see to keep all ages interested",,
,,Beauty and views everywhere,5,,"The gardens alone are amazing - every time you turn a corner there are more beautiful views, either of the garden or the surrounding city. There is no cost to just walking around the gardens and a small fee to make use of the shuttle that takes you to the far side of the gardens where the domes are situated.
The sound and light show at 7:45 and 8:45 pm in the Supertree grove is a lot of fun - a real photo opportunity. We went up onto the skyway that connects these massive structures which provided even more amazing vistas (requires a ticket). Just be aware that if you don't like heights, the walk way gets quite narrow at certain points.
There are 2 display domes and an extra ticket covers entrance for both domes. I explored the Cloud Forest which is amazing with it's waterfall and colourful splashes of tropical orchids.
There is a food court near the Supertree grove that provides lots of food options at a range of prices.",,
,,Tulipmania,5,,I never saw so many tulips at the same place fabulous for photos well organized for the visit and confortable,,
,,Amazing plants,5,,The light plants are amazing and it was an incredible experience. They also add wood carvings and artwork which adds to the whole ambience of the place. It鈥檚 a must-see in Singapore.,,
,,Best day!,5,,I could come to the gardens every time I鈥檓 in Singapore. This time it was a tulip festivals and the escape from the heat was a welcome bonus. My favourite part in the flower dome is the cactus gardens and I love the waterfall in the cloud dome.,,
,,The Garden By Bay,5,,"Excellent place. A Must Visit This Place if you're first time visiting Singapore. And if you go by a group of more than 4 people, you can get a maxi cab taxi or call +6593364142 for more information.",,
,,Pictures don鈥檛 do it justice,5,,"I have just come back from a fantastic trip in Singapore, and the Gardens by the Bay were my absolute favourite. I did the cloud forest and the flower dome, this costs $28 for both and you can鈥檛 just pick one of the two. If you can, walk everywhere! So many hidden little treasures and absolutely worth it! The light display was truly fantastic, a show done to the music of Star Wars!",,
,,Stunning!,5,,"We went in the evening for the light show, it was magical and wish I had time to go again! Best view is in the middle and you can sit on the grass to view the show, there are food & drink places near by, so you could eat and drink while watching the show. Must visit place while you are here!",,
,,A must see,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is a wonderful place to visit. must see both during the day and at night. The domes offer different experiences to your senses sight, feel, smell. Throughout the year, the Gardens change their themes meaning that you won't tire from visiting.",,
,,Stunning and spectacular installations,5,,"Not one to have green fingers, this place is stunning and can be enjoyed by all.
The installations, the quirky touches and twists.
My recommendation is to go early o avoid the crowds, I went when it opened and it was a rather quiet experience, a bit later, you鈥檒l run the risk of more tourist and school excursions.",,
,,"We visit this place every time in Singapore, it was amazing for Spring!",5,,"Visited again this May we had a lovely half day going into each area of the dome. Each time we visit we see suttle changes, and new things. It was fresh and exciting being amongst all the new growths. The daffodils were breathtaking, set around windmills and cloggs!
Plenty of toilets there and foods and drink.
Not expensive to get in, and well worth the visit.
For children very educational, especially in the large screen demonsdtrations of the plant and changes to it.",,
,,Amazing Light and sound show!!,5,,This attraction really lives upto its hype. One can enjoy the music and lights show twice. Once while relaxing in the grass and the other while perched on the Skywalk. The wait time can be a bit long but the view from above is worth all the wait. Definitely deserves a visit while in Singapore,,
,,A wonder,4,,"Tulip festival was on when we visited. Nice, vibrant place. Feel close to nature, although being indoors.",,
,,Great to look around,4,,A visit to the cloud forest and supertree groves is a must. Plus check out any of the ongoing exhibits.,,
,,Breath taking,5,,"One of the must see attractions when in Singapore, absolutely a must see. Very commercialized though.",,
,,Not to be missed!,5,,This is a must-see when in Singapore. The architecture and botanical genius is worth your time. It definitely makes for stunning photos!,,
,,What a special place,4,,"Really worth visiting, it鈥榮 a unique place and the lightshow was lovely. Would go there at sunset to see it at daytime and in the dark.",,
,,Absolutely incredible,5,,"Compared with the experience of the marina bay observation deck (see other reviews), this was way better and better value.

The gardens themselves are wonderful, but the cloud and flower domes are both brilliant. The cloud dome was better for us 鈥渨esterners鈥?as the flowers were something different and the largest indoor waterfall was superb.

The flower dome was great too, but we have many of these flowers in our gardens, so may be a better experience for non westerners.

And from 7:45 there鈥檚 an evening light show which is not to be missed. All for roughly the same price as a trip up to the marina bay sands observation deck.

I鈥檇 go again tomorrow ......",,
,,Night Show is a MUST!,5,,"Seeing the gardens by the bay is great during the day But every night at 7.45 and 8.45 there is a light show to music. This an absolute must! The gardens are free however if you want to go on the skywalk it is $8 and the 2 indoor gardens there is also a cost, we didn't go.",,
,,Gardens by the day,4,,Wonderful place to visit the indoor misty domes. The theme exibit is also good to see along with tallest manmade indoor waterfall. Light show in the evening is mesmerizing. Have lots of food options to dine too. Best time to visit is 4pm-8pm.,,
,,Interesting place,4,,Very attractive place to go for with family & friends where u can take very nice shot and nice place for tourist!,,
,,Whoa.... better than the pictures,5,,"I didn鈥檛 really know what to expect but what I experienced exceeded my expectations.

The gardens approaching the domes are immaculate and so developed in a short space of time.

The ticketing was easy and finding your way around was simple.

The displays are beyond belief when you consider the size of some of the trees and where they came from. Eg the olives from Europe... huge examples.

Both domes are a sight to behold and well worth the entry fee.

There were a decent number of places to eat and varying cuisines to choose from.

Thoroughly enjoyable few hours meandering around.",,
,,Love the latest exhibit!,5,,Visited the floral fantasy after a long day of work with my 5 Yo. It鈥檚 such a beautiful exhibit resembling Avatar. Do visit this exhibit if you are at the Gardens by the Bay.,,
,,Fantastic Experience,5,,Absolutely loved the gardens by the Bay. Visited during the day and also went back fir the light show at night.,,
,,"Garden of the future, right in the middle of the city",5,,"Mention Singapore's Garden By The Bay, most would think of its 2 fantastic dome(Cloud Forest & Flower Dome), and the gigantic Supertrees. However these are just a small portion of what you can find at the area called Bay South. Garden By The Bay consists of 3 waterfront gardens, Bay South, Bay East and Bay Central.
Most of the main attractions can be found at Bay South, and its the nearest to the MRT station. My favorite would be the Cloud Forest, an indoor forest, with a regulated climate similar to mountain top, in which the waterfall is the center piece. With a few levels showcasing different flora at varying altitude.
The Flower Dome showcases many different species of flowers from different regions. The flowers get updated on a regular basis based on the season, like in March, the lovely sakura flowers and even a row of torii gates were showcased.
For a bird eye view of the whole garden, I would highly recommend visiting the OCBC Skyway, a hanging bridge linking 2 supertrees.
For families with young kids, your kids would loved the Childre's Garden, where they can play in the water playground. The best thing is this playground is free.
There are more you can explore. In the morning or evening, the garden is a very nice relaxing place to take a stroll or jog. You can also cycle or skate on the path at the waterfront.
For a fantastic view of the city skyline, the domes and even SIngapore Flyer, make your way to Bay East.",,
,,Visited the cherry blossom event,5,,had a great time taking pictures at the cherry blossom event! even saw some ladies in kimonos! amazing experience,,
,,Want to go back,5,,We loved visiting here. Did both domes and the tree top walk. Would like to visit in the evening as well.,,

,,Excellent,4,,"An indoor forest is the city. Very well designed. Lots of plants to learn from. Atmosphere is cool, and the best one is the waterfall.",,

,,Amazing!,5,,Beautiful musical light show at night at no charge! A highlight of our visit! Great walk with so much to see!,,

The most wonderful place to go. I always feel transported to an amazing rainforest surrounded by the most amazing orchids and anthuriums. Simply AMAZING !!!
Have been here with family and friends it is most definitely worth a visit if you are in Singapore. To see things at a leisurely pace you will need to spend a few hours. There is a lot to see even out side the domes.",,

,,Garden in the City,5,,"Definitely a must-visit when you travel to Singapore! Allot ample time to visit each attraction, Flower Dome, Cloud Forest, Super Trees and OCBC Skyway. Best time to visit is from afternoon until evening to 7 and 8:45pm. For OCBC Skyway, make sure to first get a time slot at the OCBC ticket counter before heading to the entrance going up. Visitors can stay for 15-mins on top.

We bought our vouchers via Klook and redeeming the tickets is very convenient since you no longer need to wait in line to get the ticket. But going to Red Dot Museum to collect the tickets is quite a walk, so be ready. 鈽猴笍",,
,,Beautiful and unique display,5,,"We have been to this place three times and every visit made me love this place even more, its a garden with Air conditioning (partly).The flower dome is my favourite, you can expect it to be colourful and peaceful when u walk through them.

Allow enough time and don't leave it too late in the evening to go as the tree-walk and other activities have long waits- we had to go twice as we missed seeing what we wanted to in just one visit. It is well worth visiting.,,
,,A must-go place when in Singapore,5,,"Gardens By The Bay is worth a visit. Three simple reasons:
1. A beautiful garden right in the middle of the city (well almost!) to enjoy either a leisurely walk in the evenings (preferable) and take in some fresh air and get some exercise. The place is also then decorated for different festivals and celebrations. A treetop walk lets you get a treetop view of the surroundings.

2. Two beautifully curated exhibition spaces for flora & horticulture from literally around the world that is well maintained and thriving. Both, the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest, are a must visit. One showcasing the plants from all corners of the world while the other housing a man made waterfall and providing a lush forest like place to walk around. A real stress buster or place to rejuvenate yourself.

3. A bunch of restaurants serving good food to fuel you up... you don鈥檛 have to venture out to enjoy different cuisines.

A convenient, comfortable and easygoing place to visit.",,
,,Spectacular,5,,"Visited both day and evening. Either way you鈥檝e got to be amazed at Singaporean can do!
Flower dome and Cloud domes are a must see, day and or night. Cool inside so don鈥檛 worry about the heat. The plant assortment is amazing.

The super trees are strange things but the night time light and music show best uses their appearance to great effect. Shows at 7:45pm and 8:45pm.",,
,,Have to see.,5,,"The gardens by the bay are just amazing with the educational value and the two domes, so much to see and the artwork/sculptures are amazing, you see more detail the more you look. The night show was just spectacular.",,
,,Enjoy it inside or out!,4,,"Conveniently located right behind the Marina Bay Sands you鈥檒l find the beautiful Gardens By The Bay...and boy are they breathtakingly beautiful!
Singapore does a lot of things right, and this is one of them!
This can be a free day out, strolling around the perfect manicured gardens, or you can pay the reasonably priced entrance fees and enter the magical realms of the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome. We purchased tickets for both and weren鈥檛 disappointed, it鈥檚 truly beautiful and awe inspiring inside!
There may be a long waiting time for the elevator inside the Cloud Forest, but once you鈥檝e been taken up to the top (it鈥檚 six floors high!) you can wander back down at your own pace and leisure.
The Flower Dome had a tulip display when we were there, and we found it difficult to get to the main display because of the crowd, but we were still happy with what we鈥檇 seen.
It was dusk by the time we left both domes, so the Flower Funnels were lit up out in the gardens, they truly are a sight to behold. And the Marina Bay Sands was looking resplendent as a back drop. The Singapore Flyer across the water was lit up too, begging for a photo, and I still maintain that Singapore is the most photogenic city I鈥檝e been to!
It鈥檚 a must do in Singapore!",,

,,Fantastic and free,5,,"The Gardens By The Bay are well worth a visit, particularly if you go around 6pm while it is light and then walk around until 7.45pm when the trees come to life to music for 15 mins of wonder. It鈥檚 a light and music extravaganza. They repeat the scene again at 8.45pm.

There are so many activities during the year you have just to carefully check their calendar for find the one is more interesting for you. Sometimes you have some bills surprise, I recommend to bring with you something for snack or drink or buy them before visiting as the local vendor are averaging very expensive. There are some acceptable price restaurants and food court. Don't forget to enjoy the sunset on the top of the super tree bar, with the entry ticket a drink is included.",,
,,The Best Part of our Singapre Holiday,5,,"It is worth it to visit Singapore just to see Gardens by the Bay.
We went twice. The first day to see the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome.
The second day to see the Super Forest Grove as well as the Kids Adventure Trail and Meadows.

Breathtaking. Just breathtaking. You get the feel of an Amazon Rainforest combined with Landscaping of Elite Botanical Gardens. They had the best Dutch Tulips imaginable in the Flower Dome.

Just go and enjoy for yourselves.",,
,,Go for the light show,5,,The light show at Gardens by the Bay is well worth an hour. You can combine this with a visit to Marina Sands for a drink. (You can even see the light show from the top of the hotel. The music is great and the colors are beautiful. Go for the earliest evening show and then head for a great Singapore dinner.,,

,,Flower Dome,5,,Lunch at Pollen and complimentary visit to flower dome. Nice food and ambience at Pollen. Pretty flowers and photo-taking at flower dome. Strongly recommended!,,
,,Go here!!,5,,"These gardens are at the foot of the massive Marina Bay Hotel. They consist of two huge indoor domes and an elevated walkway that takes you on a Alice in Wonderland trip around the huge metal 鈥渢rees鈥?Think Crazy Rich Asians wedding reception.

The indoor air conditioned domes house the meticulous plantings of the world. You can see Holland tulips, California palm trees, and even a life sized Lego display popping out among huge ferns. Every plant is well, perfect. And there is an indoor waterfall that fall from top to bottom of one of the domes

It is magical.",,
,,Always wanted to come and see this,5,,"It didn't disappoint, Undoubtedly the highlight of our visit to Singapore. The gardens themselves are free, includsing the light show in the evenig. I think dusk is the time to go as everything colours up, and then they put the lights on. Find a spot in the middle and sit on the concreteor steps (the whole place is very clean) and don't miss the show. (If you want a taxi home after suggest booking one in advance, otherwise you'l queu with a hundred other folk for one - it's only 10 mins walk to the MRT at the Bayfront). THe skyway walk is ok, and worth doing forthe few quid it costs to get a good view, note this is quieter in the mornings! Also do recommend the two domes, they are just fantastic - that is the flower domne and cloud forest, don't miss them. You can spend a whole day at the gardens",,
,,Beautiful green house,5,,"You may spend a half day at the Gardens By The Bay. If you only riding a bicycle or walking around the park, no need to buy tickets!I visited the greenhouse and need to buy a ticket!just buy it at the entrance or from the klook which is a little bit cheaper. I used the bar code to enter the park so no need to line up for the queue.There are so many plants to see. And some artificial waterfalls! I felt very comfortable to walk inside especially when it was really hot outside!Don鈥檛 hesitate to take a taxi there!The taxi at Singapore is so cheap and you may save lots of time!But you may also take a bus but you may need to transfer and need double of transportation time!",,
,,beautiful,5,,walked to this attraction as it wasso close to our hotel really enjoyed the experince welllaid out and beautiful,,
,,Gardens by the bay,5,,Wonderful place to visit. Have been here on many occasions. Very well maintained. The only thing I would comment on is the lack of eating facilities.,,
,,Exciting nature experiance,5,,Highlight of the garden by the bay is defenetly the two domes with the mediteranian and the tropical climate. But also the other gardens outside are impressing and nice for relaxing and very informative.,,
,,Day out,5,,"Singapore version of our Eden Project but much better. Very impressive and full of WOW factor. Love the fragrant orchids garden. Should put up a sign for awareness..children under control with supervision. Noticed some children picking the flowers with no attendants present.
We are amazed znd curious where the staglamite comes from as we are aware it is a precious limestones from caves. However the attendant was unable to give us any clues.
Overall worth a visit. Best attractions.",,
,,Must Do,5,,"A very nice, world-class attraction. Easy to get to by the subway. Good crowd management. People from all over the world enjoy this place.",,
,,Exceptionally Beautiful,5,,"It goes without saying, your trip to SG is incomplete if you haven't visited / experienced the beautiful Gardens by the bay. Visit early evening and you will take few hours to complete the whole walk around. By 6 30 / 7 pm with the lights on, you will never forget how beautiful this place is.",,
,,"You can't disagree with 30,000 other reviewers !",5,,"This is brilliant. For anyone interested in plants or gardening of any kind it's a must do. It's vast, it's immaculate, it can be tiring and apart from special exhibitions it's free. The walkway through the metal trees , which you pay for, is a great experience and the views are amazing going far to the horizon. We were staying in the Marina Bay Sands Hotel so it was an easy walk through to get there but there appeared to be ample parking etc. Eating area on site had great air con, plenty of seating , and a variety of different eating options. The coffee bar at the entrance did a Rosemary Chicken sandwich which was brilliant and one of the best latte I had in Singapore. Would I reccomend? Without a doubt. Would I like to go back tomorrow? YES, but I'm 7000 miles away now.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay Floral Dome and Cloud Forest.,5,,It's a very nice place to visit. Very relaxing and also suitable to bring your baby. They can appreciate the nice colors of the plants. The trip is about 15mins each dome and each dome have a cool temperature around 21deg if I'm not mistaken. You can visit the 2 dome at the same time if you are not pressed for time. I book through Gardens by the Bay website and I find the price to be cheaper than other site for locals. It was a very pleasant experience.,,
,,Floral Fantasy at GBB,4,,Especially enjoyed the 4D multimedia ride. I feel as though I was flying in an helicopter and looking at the world below... Awesome!,,
,,Coolest public garden ever,5,,Unexpectedly unique. A visual treat especially for the amateur photographer. The imposing Supertree Grove is a spectacular and beautiful structure and a stroll along its elevated walkway must be really fun (unfortunately it was closed because of high winds the day that we were there). Our favourite experience there was a walk through the Cloud Forest- a misty indoor mountain of sorts with an elevated walkway that encircles the structure. So cool.,,
,,"Loved the Cloud Forest, amazing",4,,"Great display, so well done it was worth the visit, Took longer than expected. Go in morning - too busy in afternoon",,
,,Not to be missed,5,,"We couldn't miss a visit to these amazing gardens whilst we were in Singapore. You definitely need a good few hours to walk around especially in the 32* heat we had on the day we were there, but the gardens are so peaceful and calming and there's so much to explore. Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are definitely worth the extra charge and the plants and structures are stunning. Of course a visit to the iconic Supertree Grove made our day and there's a Skyway walkway between the trees that can be done for $8. As mentioned there are several light shows throughout the evening which we chose to watch from the rooftop of the Marina Bay Sands hotel.",,
,,Need to visit when in Singapore!,5,,"The gardens are top! You can't come to Singapore, without visiting the gardens! The fee is so worth it enjoy!",,
,,One of our holiday highlights,5,,"Access to the gardens is free, there are lots of things to see & do for couples as well as families, the children鈥檚 area was really popular & looked like a lot of fun with dedicated facilities for those using the area. Plenty of toilets & water drinking fountains throughout the gardens.

The whole area is well maintained & an absolute pleasure to stroll around but for me the light show just made it perfect, we鈥檇 done the skywalk paying $8 each & that was great but for us the highlight was the light & music show, I was mesmerised, it takes place twice per evening at 7.45 & 8.45 & your best vantage point is in front of the skywalk opposition the large super tree grove, the music is brilliant & the atmosphere electrifying, one piece of advice is if travelling by MRT, buy your ticket beforehand as the queues afterwards are absolutely horrendous & take around an hour to diminish. You鈥檒l be really smug if you take my advice! Whatever you decide though, just have yourself an amazing time!",,
,,Tropical paradise in the middle of a bustling city,5,,This was a very pleasant visit given that Singapore is all about hustle and bustle. The environment was tropical and there was so much to see and do. Worth the visit.,,

,,Wonderful My day,5,,Love all the florals. Really feel in fantasy. Love the 4D too. My family really enjoy the ride. Feelin destress.,,
,,Floral fantasy a fantasy place for me,5,,"Very nice place with many flowers. Love to see so many species of flowers.
But the queue for the 4D ride is too long as it only admits 24 pax per session which last for 15min. The 4D ride is nothing special to me as is just an introduction of the whole garden by the bay...",,
,,Cooling rainforest retreat,5,,Great for a late afternoon walk for a few hours. The cloud dome takes the longest but well worth it and a welcome relief if its a sticky afternoon.,,
,,Floral Fantasy,5,,"All the attractions included in the floral fantasy were fantastic and it was an Excellent Experience,Really enjoyed the way it has been presented.",,
,,Fantastic attraction,5,,Gardens very varied and beautiful. Waterfall was breathtaking and the best part of the attraction until we watched the light show at night. Must see tourist attraction in Singapore. Buy your tickets online as good savings.,,
,,Floral Fantasy,4,,"A small version of flower dome. Very beautifully decorated with orchids and many flowers.
Many photographic spots.
Has a 4D show in the end before exit which showed the gardens by the baton a different perspective of a dragon fly - my kids and we too enjoyed well.
Make sure you enjoy the floral displays well before you enter 4D show, since after 4D we need to exit the floral fantasy.",,

,,Check out the Cloud Forest,4,,"Worth checking out this gimmick - so beautiful and overwhelmingly incredible. Flower Garden was nice, but nothing you haven't really seen before. I really enjoyed the Cloud forest as was like a mini rainforest and very unique to walk around and see ll the different plants. Try do your tour in evening as there are free lightships at the Supergroves (the bird nest things) at 7.45pm and 8.45pm nightly.",,

,,A lovely morning.,5,,We set off early and enjoyed a lovely morning in the gardens. We visited both domes (28 $ each person) and were very impressed. So cool inside and excellent exhibits to walk around. Worth a visit.,,
,,Awesome,5,,"Went during the day and just spent hours walking around , the aircond domes are great just to walk around and get out of the heat. We went back at night time for the light show stunning , everybody should put this on a bucket list.",,
,,Paradise on earth,5,,"101 hectres of creative innovation on natures' incredible gift put together by intelligent human minds in creating such a wonder on a reclaimed land! Not the usual botanical gardens! With well planned & organised landscaping of trees, plants, schrubs, flora & fauna and more Gardens By The Bay is A MUST EXPERIENCE when in Singapore, aptly called City In The Gardens! Supertree structures 'mushroooming' towards the clouds housing 'creeper schrubs' envoloping them and 'boasting' an incredible light shows at 19:45hr & 20:45hr nightly illuminating the night accompanied by tantalising music we were at awe and excitement! Learnt that the Children's gardens alone costs millions of dollars to build. The OCBC Skywalk - bridge 'hanging' in the air bringing thrilling moments strolling from one supertree to another with breathtaking view of the sea, the bird's eye view of the gardens and the iconic Marina Bay Sands and Singapore' beautiful city skyline. We can see Indonesia from there too. The epic was our out of this world experience in the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. They are 2 gigantic glassdomes with temperature cooler than the exterior yet NO AIRCONDITIONER used i was told! Magical! The permanent display in the Flower Dome are trees more than 1000 years old and the entire display in it are based on a theme of the period. We were there and Tulips was the main exhibition. It felt like we were in Holland with all the decor of that indoor garden cleverly done to suit the theme. Cloud Forest at one instant truly made us imagine we were walking on clouds with those mist and gorgeous vertical landscape and odd shaped bridges going in and out of it with freshness in the air it make you feel healthier from before entering these paradiso! So many more i would like to share but its best to self experience it to truly appreciate life and nature. Incredible that the gardens is free/complimentary/gratis! But the 2 domes, OCBC bridge and tramrides are with a fee but it is acceptible and can be very a needed convenience for many. So go visit pronto!",,
,,amazing lightshow,5,,"Gardens were beautiful, it was busy but well worth the trip. The light and music show was spectacular. would definately go again",,
,,Mr,5,,"We were surprised with the helpfulness at the ticket office. Shuttle service was great. The maps available was a great help for first time visitors. Pleasantly surprised with the setup and layout. Woh for the cloud dome, what an exprience to walk through. The rapsody's light show in the evening, what an experience. Great to visit this whole area.",,
,,Unseen before,5,,Commendable effort and investment. The whole world should look up for these people who truly made the world the better place.,,
,,go at night for the light show,4,,"I visited twice, the day time is much quieter, better to view the cloud forest and gardens etc. At night it is very busy as everyone is there for the light show. Tickets do not specify a day so I would suggest seeing the gardens during the daytime and come back for the light show only.",,
,,Saw this by day and night,5,,"We went in the afternoon to see these fabulous gardens but the evening was amazing. The night we went to the light show with music in the trees and walkway, was a homage to 70s disco, which was fab.

This show was for free and I would suggest you take something you can sit or lay on, on the ground so you can look up at the light show, I left with a smile on my face. I wish I could have bought the music to take home or even somewhere I could have danced!

Thanks Singapore.",,
,,Awesome place mostly free,4,,"Lots to see and do here mainly free of charge including a great light show at 1945 and 2045. A free extras to pay for if you want to like the conservatory, plant worl and the forest.",,

,,Wow,5,,"The gardens are well worth visiting...and the domes are amazing! Yes, contrived, yes lots of people but all done so well. Stunning. We spent pretty much all day there...money well spent.

,,A must for one of your days.,5,,"You can probably combine the Marina Bay Sands lookout deck and the Gardens by the Bay in one activity trip.
The enclosed gardens inside the temperature controlled domes are amazing, along with waterfall and cloud forest area at the top of the building. They had a special Tulip display when we were there.",,
,,One time visit,5,,"This is one of the most beautiful places you'll ever be especially if you're into botany etc

The cloud some was my favourite and just looking at the super groove tree will blow your mind make sure to eat something before you visit here as the eating options inside is very limited and expensive

I bought my tickets for this at the hotel itself which were around 鈧?300 (19$)

Also you'll have to shell out extra if you want to walk between those big super groove tree",,
,,A must,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is a must. You really only need to do the Cloud Forest and the Supertree Grove. The other garden is ok. You can spend hours inside the Cloud Forest. Get the return stamp and come back at night for the tree light show at 7:45PM or 8:45PM

Also the only place I found milk tea frozen yogurt in a Mcdonalds.",,
,,Fantastic! That's what a modern park is supposed to look like!,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is pretty much the prototype what a new urban park in the 21st century is supposed to look like. A great mix of parklands, fantastic architecture and plenty of attractions.

My favorite part of the park is probably the Supertree Grove with its spectacular lightshow once it gets dark.

Other attractions include the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome. Admission to the park itself is free of charge, but there is a separate entry fee for most attractions.",,
,,"Impressive in many ways, but a somewhat sterile experience",4,,"A somewhat bizarre experience, with lots of people experiencing 鈥榥ature鈥?in a largely indoor highly planned environment. Also the contradiction of a display indicating the impact of climate change on the environment in a venue utilising lots of energy.",,
,,So much more than I expected,5,,We were amazed at Gardens by the bay. Incredible things to see and you can enjoy almost everything for free. We were there with the light show that鈥檚 on every night. Definitely recommend people to experience that.,,

Not as crowded as I have expected on a Friday late morning. Small place but quite spacious. Worth a visit if you have not been yet.,,

,,Beautiful and educational,5,,"Loved this place... we unfortunately only had one day in Singapore and it was POURING with rain. We decided to visit the gardens and go to the flower dome and cloud forest. We鈥檙e so happy we did! Cloud forest was an educational experience - with so much information about cloud forests and sustainability. Not just beautiful, but informative.

Flower dome was really busy as the tulip festival was on, but still gorgeous.

The rain cleared up and we were able to enjoy the rest of the gardens. The cacti garden was my favourite.",,

,,Spectacular,4,,Went to Gardens By The Bay to see the light show at night. Very busy place to be. Light Show was brilliant. Didn't pay to go to the Flower Domes. Another time.,,
,,Amazing gardens,5,,"This is a must see for any traveller to Singapore. It's an amazing oasis with something for all the family. The highlight for me and my family was definitely the giant artificial trees. We walked round the elevated walkway in the trees in the daytime and went back to see the spectacular light show at night. My kids enjoyed the waterpark which wasn't just fun, it provided a lovely cool down for us Brits who weren't used to the heat of Singapore. The two greenhouses were amazing.

You pay for the greenhouses and the walk around the top of the trees but, apart from that, it's free, which in itself is amazing. The place is a feat of imagination.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,What an amazing place. The conservatory displays are amazing. Floral design is a must to see. The light show of a night is not to be missed. Is a must see if in Singapore.,,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,"Easy to access thru MRT. A wonderful place to spend time. Colourfull emberella's show are 7.45pm & 8.45pm

Gardens are also nice to walk especially in a cloudy weather.

World's biggest indoor WATERFALL is also there, fully aircondioned & colourfull with flowers & greenry. Closing time 9pm

A very amazing DANCING FOUNTAIN show is daily at 8pm & 9pm . A nice place to walk along the lake & crusing.",,
,,Flowers,5,,Fabulous day out ! well worth the vist & the money ..the evening flower light show was phenomenal. Very clean and accessible for all patrons young and old,,
,,A must visit,3,,A very good place to start the tour . For once u will be astonished to see a complete forest like ambience being artificially built . And don't miss the night light show . Best time to visit is around 4pm .,,
,,Follow up visit to the gardens - daytime,5,,"What a spectacular place , so interesting and beautiful can only describe these gardens. The amount of time , money and content is just breathtaking. Would recommend a must visit. Endeavoured to post even one , however appears too large !",,
,,Rates with any other iconic structure on the planet,5,,"Absolutely stunning pieces of architecture and I cannot really describe how good this precinct is, you just have to go. Access by rail is easy although you have to have some level of fitness as the walk for the platform to the domes is over a km. There were electric carts that would take you there for $3Sg but when a rail trip from the centre of the city is $0.80 it's a bit steep. Take your time and enjoy the walk.",,
,,Great,5,,Great place to wander around! We went in the morning to try to avoid the hottest time of the day..... Still very hot! Take an umbrella for shelter,,
,,Beautiful,5,,"This was a beautiful place to visit, seemed quite busy but the climate control made the slow stroll very enjoyable.. Skywalk was neat also. The kids loved the splash pad.",,
,,Worthwhile!,4,,"While I鈥檓 not much of a plant person, the architecture and views inside the buildings are impressive and the park is lovely. Great to see near end of day with sunset and light show at 7:45!",,
,,"Beautiful, magical",5,,"We visited late afternoon (6:30pm) to avoid the heat. With the lights, it feels pretty magical. We did go up to the platform as you have to get an allocated time and the wait was too long (2 hours). Instead, we strolled around to take in the scenery and take some pictures. It is definitely worth a visit.",,
,,Amazing! Couldn鈥檛 fault,5,,Gardens by the bay are like nothing you have ever seen before! It can take all day to visit everything around the park but it is well worth it! Go in the day and the night because they are both spectacular!! Seeing the night show was the highlight for me!,,
,,Beautiful and extensive,5,,Beautiful gardens with lots of space to walk around. Didn鈥檛 go into the domes due to time and a cost of $28. Lots of variety. The light show was fantastic. Unable to dine after the light show was the only oroblem,,
,,Beautiful garden,4,,Its a beautifully set up garden offering different themes. For an additional fee the skywalk which puts you 22 meters in the air on a 128-meter aerial walkway through the Super trees. Its gives a nice view of the park.It's a lovely experience for kids.,,
,,Highlight of Singapore,5,,"I probably enjoyed this the most of all the attractions. The gardens are superb. There's a great children's playground, the Flower and Cloud domes are amazing and the super grove trees, spectacular! There are lots of park amenities including cafes, food court style options and fancier restaurants (even unfortunately, a McDonalds). Countries around the world should look to see how well Singapore integrates nature, conservation and public amenity.",,
,,well if you like waiting for ever in the heat ...,3,,"To be honest it's a nice place to walk , walk in the park ...and if you like waiting for ever in the heat than you will love this place , I am not sure what to see when you can to the botanic garden and enjoy a quiet and peaceful environment .",,
,,A must see,5,,"I saw this place on a TV show back home two years ago and vowed then I wanted to see these amazing gardens. I just have and I wasn鈥檛 disappointed, the Gardens are breathtaking, a must see if you鈥檙e in Singapore. Loads of places to eat, reasonably priced and staff who look after you very well. Thank you to everyone at Gardens By The Bay, a wonderful experience.",,
,,A must visit,5,,"Whilst only visiting part of the Gardens, this was an amazing experience and truly lives up to the standard of Singapore.",,
,,A nice activity in Singapore,4,,"There are many things to do here. You have coffee, have lunch at McDonalds, there are kids water activities and log winding trails to different parts of the park. Probably very good for families/large groups. There is a taxi stand at the entrance. Great views of Singapore city and Marina Bay.",,
,,Beautiful and very well set up!,5,,"The whole experience on gardens by the bay was fantastic! We really enjoyed all it had to offer. We went to the later showing of the light show at 8pm and this was a little less crowded than the 7pm showing - - get there at least 20 mins early and position yourself under the central tree - lie back and take it all in. The light show lasts 15 mins and is accompanied by music - make sure you can see at least two or three trees from your position. This is a free event and one of the highlights of our trip!
The next day we paid to go into the two domes - these were a real welcome relief as the temperature inside is about 15 degrees - I would recommend the flower dome first which is well maintained and has various beautiful flowers in each area - we then went to the cloud forest / the waterfall on entrance is an obvious highlight but then you walk down through the trees and was really enjoyable.
I would say just over an hour in each dome was enough for us however if you are into flowers you can spend much longer there.

Overall would recommend the light show as must and the domes if you have time!",,
,,Perfect for family bonding.,5,,Went to the gardens by the bay yesterday and we had so much fun. Everything is awesome and organize what a nice way to spend time with family and friends. Went to see the lighting show evening time around7:45 and it lasted for more than 10 minutes. I love the theme because it was Disco. It made me feel like dancing all trough out.,,
,,Just in awe,5,,"Wow. So much has changed since the last time I visited SG. GARDENS BY THE BAY is # 1 must to visit. And there's so much to do around the area without spending any dime. we went to the place around 5 PM. Did our leisure walk from the grove trees area to the merlion statue. Though it was a bummer as the statue was going through renovation. We ate at the food court for dinner (there's so many options. There's hawker place on the opposite side of the river.


A lot of people mlm doing their active exercises- jogging,walking, and running. Next time I'll bring my running gear!

We stayed there until the 745 PM lights show. This was also free and open to public. I wasn't too much impressed with the sound quality. They could use a better system. But overall experience was 9/10!",,
,,Stunning,5,,"What a masterpiece Singapore certainly do things well, this man build gardens inside climate controlled domes with large waterfall were so beautiful I would highly recommend visiting this location nice and cool also to avoid the hot weather then the outside music to lights show in the trees is definitely worth staying for also",,
,,Gardens at the Bay,5,,"Beautiful gardens under 2 domes that were temperature controlled. You could spend a whole day here, there is so much to see. Very well designed with great signage and lots of information about the different countries and the species of trees and plants they have.",,
,,A bit disappointing,4,,"We went to Gardens by the bay because of all the raves and buzz this place got. Be careful, the entrance can be hard to find. Enter by the Marina Bay Hotel, as you will be able to admire a charming view of the park, which seemed really nice and beautiful. However, we remained a bit disappointed : the garden was really huge, but most of it was concrete and kitch ""gardens"" which -supposedly- represented different cultures. They have an water area for children who enjoy it a lot. Gardens by the bay is a very nice place indeed, but not one which's worth a lot of time there.",,
,,Great way to spend half a day,5,,"Had to see the Gardens By The Bay as they had not been built the last time I visited.

It is a great day out for any age with lots of garden space for walks and the kids to run around.

Did pay the additional to visit the cloud forest which I enjoyed and had wanted to do the treetop walkway however due to bad weather this was closed, so do double check before you arrive.

Loved the light show, the music and lights matched perfectly and was a lot of fun.",,
,,Awesome Garden by the bay,4,,This is a great place to visit. They have tram services inside and also it is completely mind blowing. Various species of flora and fauna,,
,,Stunning,5,,Beautiful gardens with diverse areas including the super trees. The two pavilions are a must and are good value as well as being a welcome break from the heat. Easy to get to by foot or public transport. An absolute must. We will go back for the night light show.,,
,,Beautiful gardens,5,,Beautiful gardens & worth a visit. Be prepared for long walks between attractions & check the weather as if it rains you will get soaked.,,
,,Fabulous,5,,Really great thing to do on a hot Singaporean day. It is quite cool inside. So great thing to do when it鈥檚 hot.,,
,,Well worth a visit,4,,"This is far more than a single attraction with both outside gardens and indoor, paying things to do. We really enjoyed the evening light show which was very well done with a real 鈥淒isney鈥?feel. The Cloud Dome was also very interesting. Easy to spend an afternoon/evening here. Some newish food outlets help!",,
,,Beautiful place but crowded,4,,"Really impressive structures, both of the domes, and beautiful plants and gardens. We were glad we saw them and it鈥檚 worth doing once, but it鈥檚 so crowded that we were ready to get out after a couple hours. If you can figure out when the least crowded times to go are, that would be a good idea. All in all a cool experience though!",,
,,A Must See When In Singapore.,5,,"This attraction is definitely an amazing display of all plants, trees, flowers etc from all parts of the world with garden areas superbly set out to be admired by the tourists.
Where would you see & experience such magical colour with so many varieties of flowers,plants in one area under a magnificent dome roof with perfect temperatures.
It was a joy to admire these gardens on a large scale, with scrubs, plants etc from all around the world.
Staff are to be congratulated on maintaining this garden by the sea & is a credit to the landscape gardeners for their amazing layouts in all areas.
Pleasure to admire this fabulous garden.
Aussie Tourist.",,
,,"So beautiful, must see!",4,,"We bought tickets to see both conservatories - I loved the Cloud Forest more than the Flower Dome. The waterfall in Cloud Forest is amazing. I felt transported to a different world, don't miss the mist timings in the Cloud Forest. The Flower Dome is also picturesque, with different sections from all around the world. Outside the Supertrees are amazing to look at. If you can, spend some time at night to watch the light show. Many food options available in the area too.",,
,,Its okaish,3,,"Its much hyped but good for nature lover ,nice maintenance done by staff and its chilly ,have to walk more",,
,,Stunning light show to retro music,5,,"You can鈥檛 come here and not come to the light show !
It鈥檚 amazing and set to retro music from the Beegees and beetles - truly spectacular
Be warned though - the traffic and chaos to get in and out is horrendous - seriously crazy queues for taxis !
There is a good bus service available",,
,,A fair place to go,4,,A lot of types of plants/ trees that I have never seen before. It is a must-go place for people who enjoys plants.,,
,,night show is amazing,5,,travel evening so you can cover night show. both domes are amazing too. plenty to do for kids and adults,,
,,The Most Amazing Garden Dome Ever,5,,"We went to Singapore recently in March 2019 and it was a fortuitous time too as Gardens By The Bay was having their annual Japanese theme of Sakura Matsuri with gorgeous blooming cherry blossoms as well as numerous beautiful flowers and fauna.

The dome temperature was perfect at 16 degrees Celsius and on such a hot day of over 30 degrees Celsius outdoor, this was heavenly.

Lots of people were there both local and tourists.

We spent almost 2 hours in there and even had tea in their cafe.

Amazing experience and fully recommended for family and friends to visit.",,
,,Pay the admission price,5,,At first I thought the admission price to the closed parts of the gardens was a bit high but it was well worth it! The experience is completely new and a lot of work goes into the preservation and presentation of the vegetation.,,
,,Walid Abou Farhat,5,,An amzing experience you find nowhwere else. We enjoyed every moment spent. Great organization. We felt as if we left planet earth for a while and landed in Docflied planet(Goldorak)馃槉馃槉. We had a pleasant day among mother nature.,,
,,Wonderland,5,,Amazing collection of plants .... displayed in the most artistic and creative manner .... u HAVE to see it to believe it 馃憣馃徎馃憣馃徎馃憣馃徎馃憣馃徎馃憣馃徎馃憣馃徎馃憣馃徎,,
,,one of the best places to visit in Singapore,5,,"It is a must-visit attraction in Singapore especially, if you are traveling with family, parents, and kids.

The in-house attractions like cloud forests, flower dome, OCBC skyline were some of the serene places to take some good pictures of your loved ones.

Also, the musical light show was simply mesmerizing which gives a wonderful experience overall.

Connectivity to this place is super easy as it is hardly 300 meters walk from the Bayfront MRT.",,
,,Great experience,5,,An awesome experience but if you want to view the show from the walkway between the towers make sure you get there early otherwise you will not get in. You can always watch from down below which is also great,,
,,Good place to have a quick sightseeing,4,,"It was nice that the Garden by the bay is free of charge to enter. But if you would like to try to go upstairs, make sure you are there before 8:00pm since the last admission is at 8:00pm. And if you are there by 7:00pm good time to enjoy the Groovy Trees.",,
,,Gardens left us awe-struck,5,,"Seriously this has to be one of the most amazing man-made wonders of the world. Exotic plants, climbers, flowers and succulents, rainforests, desert natives beautifully landscaped and sculptured. All thriving in mostly green climate controlled temperature zones. We were totally staggered by the diversity of plantlife displayed over both of the complexes. And now with the opening of the 'Jewel' complex at Changi Airport - Singapore you rock!",,
,,Great location,5,,Definitely worth going several times! The park is very beautiful and the greenhouses are just awesome! If you get tired walking just get one of these electric scooters!,,
,,A future-like garden,4,,We have visited Gardens by the bay by night and we really felt like visiting a garden in 2050. It really deserves a stop while in Singapore.,,
,,Absolutely stunning!,5,,"If you appreciate flowers, plants, waterfalls, and natural, this is a must see! The huge waterfalls, misty air, gorgeous green & flowers... Wow, wow, wow ! just breathtaking!",,
,,A must see,5,,This place is spectacular. Everyone knows about it and all we can say is go there. It is a highlight.,,
,,Impressive but complete ecological hypocrisy,3,,"This is a really impressive area and good to look at, but what disappointed me, given it鈥檚 pitched as a temple of sustainability and ecological awareness, was the total lack of thought given to food and drink packaging.

Everything is made of or wrapped in plastic, including straws and cutlery, and much of it non recyclable. As you leave one of the big dome things you watch a video that鈥檚 meant to inspire you to save the planet, then you step outside and all you can buy to eat or drink anywhere is the most unsustainably packaged, rubbish food you can imagine. At best it鈥檚 a massively thoughtless missed opportunity, and at worst it鈥檚 wilful hypocrisy.",,
,,Wonderfull!,5,,"Wow, what a great place. We went during the day and walked around the domes and in the 鈥榗anopy鈥?and then came back at night for the light show. Kids loved all of it.",,
,,Like no other place on earth - gardeners paradise!,4,,"Visited the gardens early evening. It felt like you had gone into another world. We visited both the domes first which had so much to look at including the very impressive waterfall. We then walked into the trees to watch 1 of the 2 light shows they have on daily which was really something to behold. Definitely worth a visit even just for the light show which is free entry. Had a brilliant atmosphere and as always with it being such an impressive spectacle, it was busy!",,
,,Must visit,5,,"Loved the tulip mania at the flower dome. What variety of flowers,it's a flower lovers dream. The show at the supertree is great and one has to reach there before time to avoid the crowd ! Tulipmania displayed beautiful tulips ! Very well maintained. Do not miss 'Gardens by the bay'",,
,,Must visit!,4,,"It is hard to imagine that the entire huge area so beautifully done has been done on reclaimed land. The Gardens by the Bay offers delight to eyes and mind. Vast area full of different gardens and the renewable energy harvesting Super-tree grove is a sight to behold.

Be prepared to walk a lot as this area is huge. Starting from the ticketing counters, one can either walk over the dragonfly bridge (recommended) or take a shuttle to the flower dome. Walking is recommended unless you are short of time or came here to only visit the cloud forest or flower dome.

Crossing the dragonfly bridge, you reach the gardens and from here you have various options to explore. Either go for the cloud forest or flower dome or take in the sights of super-tree grove along with a sky bridge that connects two of the biggest artificial trees. If you dont want to do any of these, then just explore different themed gardens.

Entry to the gardens and the supertree grove is free, you need to buy tickets for the cloud forest, flower dome and OCBC skyway. Shuttle sets you back another $3 per person.

Be prepared to spend a good amount of time and take pleanty of photos. Suggestions on spending time
- Flower Dome - 1 - 1.5 hours
- Cloud Forest - 1 hour
- OCBC Skyway - 30 mins
- Rest of the gardens - until you are satisfied (But a minimum of 2 hours)

Keep in mind that on holidays and certain times, there would be queue for the skyway.

Also, the light show at the end 7:45pm and 8:45 pm are worth watching, Come to the super tree grove and find a place in a round shaped lawn that offers the best views. Make sure to come early and reserve your spot!

I would have rated 5 stars only if
1. There were good vegetarian options for food
2. The food and beverage prices were not so ridiculously priced",,
,,Got to visit!,5,,Just the most beautiful experience & perfect way to spend a few hours in comfort! I look forward to our next visit as it changes all the time!,,
,,We missed the last show at night,5,,I missed the show but the lights are still on and they are all beautiful. We were a bit lost going home after discovering the whole area. Will come back to check out the place!,,
,,Very Worthwhile Visit!,5,,The Gardens By The Bay must have taken years of planning. What an amazing and beautiful experience. The highlight of the day/evening was the light and music show. There are towers of flowers by day and by night they are lighted and synchronized to music by the Bee Gee's. It was beautiful and a must see experience when in Singapore.,,
,,Worth a visit,4,,We walked the gardens and paid the money to go into the flower dome and the cloud dome. The first was frankly disappointing as my expectation was maybe too high - so with reduced levels of anticipation the cloud dome proved very interesting and pleasing.,,
,,Pleasant way to Spend Time,5,,"It's very pleasant to quietly meander through the Gardens by the Bay complex. You cannot help but feel impressed by the imagination and skill of Singaporean engineers. How on earth, you wonder, was it possible to winch in several very old and extremely heavy olive trees and see them survive. Spending time admiring the beauty and variety of nature is never wasted and the gentle plea to return our much ravaged natural world to some sort of sane balance is an inspiring message to all ages.

Well worth a visit, or better still two: one during the day and the other at night to enjoy the spectacular light show.",,
,,Brilliant at Night Time,4,,Go at Dusk and visit the Gardens and hang around for the light show. Great experience and not to be missed when visiting Singapore,,
,,Fantastic Place,5,,"In the past, we've seen TGBTB from a distance and frankly thought it wasn't worth a visit. The tall artificial ""trees"" looked too kitchy for our tastes and made the area look less natural.

This time we decided to take a closer look expecting to spend a couple of hours at most walking around. Boy were we wrong!

Those ""couple of hours"" stretched into almost the entire day.

TGBTB has two bits.

(1) Extensive free walks and gardens.

(2) The pay-an-admission venues:
(a) OCBC tree walk (SG$8 pp) and
(b) the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest conservatories (SG$28 pp).

If you're on a tight budget, you can have quite a nice time with the free bits.

If you can afford it, the conservatories are worth the visit.

Re the free bits, there is a nice walk around the perimeter of TGBTB. Some of the many sites to see are: The boardwalk along Kingfisher and Dragonfly Lakes. The Chinese, Japanese, Malay and Colonial Gardens. A rock garden. A heritage plant garden, etc. Lots to see. Lots of nice walks.

Now to the paid attractions.

The OCBC Skywalk is relatively short, but you'll get some great views not only of the surrounding area but also a look down on trees. See the attached a tree turns into a flower picture. When there are lots of visitors, expect to be moved along for a 15minute stay.

Flower Dome is quite extensive. There's a mind boggling amount to see. More signage describing the plants would be ideal.

Cloud Forest has the tallest indoor waterfall in the world according to TGBTB..

In addition to permanent exhibits, there are seasonal ones.

Right now Tulipmania (until 20 May) a massive collection of tulips @ Flower Dome.

And Scentsational Orchids (until 22 September) @Cloud Forest - various types of orchids classified by scent type along with the reasons for the scents. What sort of pollinators are the plants seeking to attract, etc.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"What a gorgeous place to visit. Try visiting at night time to watch the amazing light show, it鈥檚 all free so make sure you get there.",,
,,Amazing,5,,The fusion of lighting and plantation is amazing. The best place to view in my opinion is near the centre. Either on the bench or just sit on the floor or even lye down.,,
,,Brilliant,5,,"If you go nowhere else, go here. Do the high-level walkway and then stay for the light show after dark. Fantastic!",,
,,A Concert in the Sky,5,,We arrived a the Super Grove in time for the blue hour - a great time to take pictures. We purchased two tickets for the skywalk at 7:40 PM. We were able to line up at 7:20 PM and reached the skywalk just in time to experience an amazing light show and music concert - a memorable experience.,,
,,Great Spot,5,,This area is real cool and the gardens are a must see. Pay to visit the indoor gardens. A great light show at night as well.,,
,,fantastic,5,,"this is one of the high lights of Singapore and well worth going , the cloud forest in particular is just awesome",,
,,"What Singapore lacks, Singapore creates...",4,,"Visitors are in town; so we head to GBB as it is a relatively new attraction in Singapore - for them. This is a weekend and of course, the crowds are there (and to be expected). Typical Singapore efficiency on display - queues are well managed, visitors moving right along and snapping pictures and just generally doing ""their thing.""

Bring on the botanics, the horticultural stuff, the lights and you have a crowd-pleaser. Air-conditioning for plants and humans in humid Singapore is never a bad thing. And the tulips are now the 'flavour of the season' and the crowd is suitably enthused.

There are many other attractions at the GBB but because of time limitation/s, we went to the FLOWER DOME and the CLOUD FOREST. If you suspend your disbelief and questions, this is a great national endeavour. But if you love au naturel stuff and appreciate flora and fauna in their natural habitats, this may not be your place. Every thing here is ably constructed and curated for a good visitor experience. What must be acknowledged are the colours and unspeakable beauty that Mother Nature continues to reward us no matter where we find her.",,
,,Do NOT miss this,5,,"We went with zero expectations, thinking it was a Singapore 'box' to tick but it ended up being an unexpected highlight of our holiday. Like everything in Singapore, it's flawless, classy and exceptionally executed. Both domes offered different experiences both for the architectual brilliance as well as their incredible nature displays. This is one for the Must Do list in Singapore.",,
,,Very nice,5,,Gardens by the bay is a must for any tourist visiting Singapore. You can just sit and relax admiring the water and views around you,,
,,Future is now!,5,,"What a great place! A walk here, across the gardens, the real trees and the supertrees, makes you feel in a different (good) world. The Cloud forest is magic and impressive. Go there in mid afternoon.",,
,,Nice field trip!,5,,Please just go visit this man made wonder. The variety of vegetation is stupendous. You will not be disappointed!,,
,,Well worth the visit,5,,We walked to this from our hotel and our walk took us through the new hotel which was a bonus. The Gardens are stunning and so well done. The Domes are great too. A hit with all the family.,,
,,An absolute must!!!,5,,"Thoroughly enjoyed our visit (well, we actaully went twice - first to the Flower Dome and then back the next evening for the Gardens by the Bay light show! Unfortunately the Cloud Forest was closed for maintenance. I have heard from other people that it is amazing!! On the list for next time through Singapore!! I would highly recommend the Gardens by the Bay to anyone who goes to Singapore.",,
,,Amazing place,5,,"You will be amazed how it was built. Best time to visit is in the evening. The light show is very nice , you can just sit and relax .",,
,,Glorious Gardens by the Bay,5,,Stunning! I don't have enough adjectives to describe how beautiful this place is. The outdoor gardens are a delight to walk through but the flower dome and cloud mountain exhibits are breathtaking. It's a must see!,,
,,Nice family activity,5,,"We enjoyed visiting the Gardens by the Bay in combination with the Cloud Forest. The Cloud Forest was slightly more spectacular, but both were worth the visit.",,
,,Wow!!鈥?5.0,,"This is the one of the most spectacular places I have ever been to.
We visited in the early evening when it was a little cooler. We had plenty of time to visit the cloud forest but less time for the flower dome.

The cloud forest with the waterfall and flowers was sooo beautiful. Walking around the different parts was so magical and out of this world.

We didn鈥檛 have time for the sky walk but it looked quite a short walk.

The show in the evening was amazing with the backdrop of marina bay sands hotel. Stunning music and light show. We all thoroughly enjoyed it.

We booked the tickets online before we arrived so could go straight to the conservatories.

Magical place which is a must visit.

Wish we had more time here.",,,
,,Beautiful afternoon at the bay,5,,"Managed to get the best of the afternoon and then the evening show. Lights are fantastic, atmosphere was lovely. Free to enter, incredibly clean well worth a visit.",,
,,Oh Wow!!,5,,"No words for this place. It seemed magical, like some sort of fairy tale land. All the flowers were beautiful and the petrified animals were amazing to see.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"This was number 1 place I wanted to visit in Singapore, and it did not disappoint me ! I had seen pictures and it is even more beautiful than pictures show. It is a free attraction, so you can just go and spend an afternoon walking around, or you can visit the suspended walkway, but then you have to pay for it. There are also other attractions you have to pay to have access to, but only if you really want to visit.
Most visitors wait until around 19h45, for the music and lights show on the big trees area. Really beautiful !!!",,
,,Absolutely breathtaking,5,,"The amazement is that this is all man-made!! A definate must-see!! The cloud garden is fantastic, the sculptures are all of the highest quality & you're taken on a worldwide journey through the stories they tell amongst all the relevant plants. Unique & well worth the visit. We had bought a visitor a pass which included free entry to the gardens, but I would definitely pay to see this is you don't have a free pass!!",,
,,An Unforgettable Experience!,5,,"Gardens by the Bay has multiple attractions within in. However, you are free to roam around the gardens at any time and enjoy the free nighttime light show that they do twice a night!

I saw the light show from the ground as well as from the roof of my hotel (Marina Bay Sands) and I have to say it is so much better when you are on the ground! The shows are at 7:45 & 8:45 PM each night, but I recommend arriving at least 30 - 45 minutes in advance in order to get a decent spot (they are all pretty good). You can also be on the Skyway during it, but have to get there super early for that as they have entry times during the light show.

The music is great, the lights are mesmerizing, and it's like nothing you have ever seen before. If you do nothing else in Singapore - come to Gardens By The Bay. It is 100% worth the visit and I cannot wait to go back to Singapore just to go here!",,
,,Loved it! Separate ticket for trees needed,5,,"Well 28 SGd for the cloudy mountain (incl flower hall) plus separately 8 SGD per Person for the Supertree Grove doesnt come cheap but for us it was well worth it.

Got to say comming from Seitzerland with the flower island Mainau nearby that was a let down. It felt a bit like seeing the Garania flowers from grandpa. Considering the mysthic cloudy mountain this was a bit of a let down.

The tree restaurant wasnt open hence watch out to book it if you want to see it.

Tipp: get there early - otherwise its just too many people.",,
,,Pleasant Atmosphere,4,,"The Garden was quite impressive. The Cloud Forest was the most impressive, it costs money thought. The next was the OCBC Skyway. Also costs money but cheaper. The one that was average was the Flower Dome. When I visited they had a Tulip Garden in association with KLM. The Garden itself is actually quite good. By the Way the closest MRT Station is Bayfront.",,
,,Flower Dome and Cloud Forest,4,,Nicely decorated. Worth a visit. Provides a good shelter even it鈥檚 raining heavily or too hot outside.,,
,,Wonderful flower dome #TulipMania,5,,I鈥檝e been here for multiple times and I can鈥檛 deny I still amazed on how they arrange all the flowers that I haven鈥檛 seen in my life.This season is #TulipMania 馃尫 馃拹 setup.,,
,,Brilliant Show of Light & Music!!!,5,,"If you plan to visit gardens by bay make sure you attend the light and sound show at 7:45 pm and 8:45 pm. Take a place under one of the trees and watch super tree dance literally to the tunes.
Adjacent to it are many more gardens and conservatories which are an engineering marvel.
You can alight at bayfront MRT station and follow the signs.
No tickets.",,
,,Skywalk and auto rider,4,,"Don't miss the skywalk among the supertrees: that's really something. Very informative the auto ride. Flower dome ok, not as beautiful as the botanic gardens. Clpud forest i think will be especially enjoyed by kids. Breathtaking views of the marina bay sands",,
,,"Great gardens but pick your time to visit, summer could be a bit hot and humid.",5,,"Had to see as it was on the bucket list and had no regrets,visited first on the day after we arrived, a Sunday as it happened, obviously very busy with locals using it for an outing, loads of kids enjoying the water fountain park, surprised by some of the comments about loads of Asians taking photos, strange that seeing as Singapore is in Asia, bit of racism there maybe.We found the people gave the gardens life and as it is mainly a free park only to be expected. We visited in January and found it warm and humid but to be honest we probably would find it very uncomfortable later in to the year, summer temps could be unbearable worth thinking about if planning a trip to Singapore. Because of the flight and jet lag etc we didn't get to do as much as we wanted on the Sunday but as our onward flight was not until Monday evening we revisited on the Monday to visit the Conservatories. Had food on the Monday at the Satay by the Bay food wasn't as cheap as the hawker places but still not too bad, and most had photos of what you could buy made it easy, very tasty.Keep a look out for the Kingfisher statues and views of the three towered hotel and of course the trees, metal ones, oh and the some of the birds you will not see at home, well not in the UK anyway, and some you may recognise.Plenty of birds near the cafe tables.",,
,,Nice place for photo,5,,An escape from the heat outside. The aircpn inside is very strong. The flowers and plants are incredible,,
,,Another world at sunset!,5,,"The tall 鈥渇orrest鈥?of fanciful trees is outstanding, particularly at sunset. The sky walk is absolutely worth the price of admission if you can time it for the light show. Not to be missed!",,
,,Tulipmania,5,,There are Vibrant coloured tulips on display. They looked fresh and lovely. These beautiful flowers give out a light and lovely scent. It鈥檚 worth a visit with family and friends.,,
,,Absolutely Amazing,5,,would definitely recommend seeing this. Beautifully manicured gardens. The trees were amazing. the cloud forest was definitley worth seeing,,
,,Beautiful,5,,Seeing the Gardens By The Bay during the day and then during the night what a difference and very lovely.,,
,,A real Natural beauty,5,,Nice place to walk and enjoy your morning Let your eye be attention to beauty details May little bit hot and humid so be careful grab you sunvisor or cap And keep drinking water or isotonic drinks,,
,,Natural Wonder,5,,Went to Gardens by the Bay.. Solo. It's easily accessible by bus or MRT I chose the bus route. Start by going for the cloud walk it's a 8 dollar ticket but totally worth it. Followed by a walk around the garden and the water pond. Very scenic u can click loads of pictures. Don't miss the cloud walk. It's got a ticket but again once u see it's the money will not matter. You can also pre book it. There is a garden for kids and water park. Satay by the bay has good food too. You can spend a day there enjoying the views and food. Very helpful staff and pleasant environment.,,
,,Fabulous,5,,This is a must see while in Singapore. It was stunning and there is so much to see. The treetop walk was great as was the flower dome.,,
,,This is a must do!,5,,"Absolutely loved this. I am a part time gardener so was totally enthralled. Worried about my teenager but she enjoyed it as much as me, Lots to look at and trails to follow. Would recommend the trip to the top of the waterfall and take your time to look at all the wonders. Until your inside the dome you cannot appreciate the gardens etc",,
,,Just go,5,,"If you only have a few hours to do one thing in Singapore, do this. It is worth visiting. Spectacular on a global scale.",,
,,Worth a visit!,5,,"I arrived around 2pm, and planned to stay in the garden till dark to see the light show. There is no entrance fee for the garden! This still surprises me especially it鈥檚 so well maintained and clean! I was only really interested in Cloud Forest out of the 2 domes, but since I鈥檓 a visitor not a resident, I had to buy a tickets for both (S$28). The Flower Dome happened to have the special Tulips exhibit so that was lucky~ the wooden animal sculptures are very beautiful in there. Then Cloud Forest, the 鈥渨alk in the cloud鈥?was very cool! I don鈥檛 wanna spoil anything haha. I also went for the skywalk of the supertree (S$8) and really enjoyed the view! Finally the free light show at 19:45, I suggest to get a spot on the grass by the food court by 19:00, so you can lie down to enjoy it :) overall experience for me is 110%!",,
,,Amazing,5,,"Gardens immaculately kept , the tree walk is a must , so impressive. Make sure you check out the two conservatories, well wort the entrance fee. Great day out, stunning flowers and trees",,
,,Pretty Impressive,5,,"I'm not a huge gadens person but have to admit this one was pretty impressive. A huge garden to walk around, a walkway tree bridge that costs $8 so you can see the city which was also pretty cool. There is also dome centres that you can walk through as well but we didn't bother to do this as we had already spent a couple of hours out here doing other things. Worth a visit!",,
,,Had a good time!!!,4,,Took my 80+ years parents. They were thrilled. Had a good time. The area is friendly to move around for old age people. The staff there are also courteous and ever willing to help. I just wish there are some joints that can offer vegetarian fast food.,,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,This was a fantastic trip and great outing. For those interested in flowers and plants it is a must. Perhaps beware of a bit of walking for the elderly.,,
,,Amazing,5,,"We have visited Gardens by The Bay many times. Each time, there were different exhibits ranging from prize orchids to Japanese Sakura flowers. All the flowers were beautiful and fragrant. In the centre of the lower level, there was a main exhibit. There, there would be a Christmas tree during Christmas, and a ketupat (rice packet) during Hari Raya. At the end of the exhibit, there is even a 3D video about how trees grow. However, it is cold, so you should bring a jacket. And that was just the Flower Dome! In the Cloud Dome, there is a huge waterfall, and a video on saving the Earth. It is titled +5掳C. There is even a pond called Butterfly Pond. I have personally seen otters there. However, do not pet them as they have been known to bite. To get there, take the MRT to Bayfront Station.",,
,,Amazing!,5,,"Singapore have certainly got this right! Bringing beautiful green areas into a bustling city, quite remarkable!
Seeing is believing, this is truly a stunning place to visit, a work of art.

It is well worth the extra to go up the 'trees' and walk along the connecting walkway, stunning and excellent views. Get there first thing in the morning, you have the place practically to yourself!
Sept 2017",,
,,Well worth a visit,4,,"It was raining so we looked for something to do that wasn鈥檛 shopping the Gardens by the Bay was a good recommendation.
We used the superb MRT to get there. Something we did all the time in Singapore and that took us pretty much straight to the ticketing entrance.
You can wander around the gardens for free but you have to pay a relatively modest amount to get entry to the two domes. When we arrived the rain had caused the skywalk to be closed which was a shame.
We wandered through the gardens to the domes and did the rainforest one first. It was busy but a combination of good layout and good organisation meant you were always walking. It was a fascinating experience and a shame that so many of the visitors seem to point the camera the wrong way. When nature is so stunning how many selfies can you need people????
You walk around the dome at various levels giving different perspectives as you go around the elevated platforms. There is plenty to read but we mainly looked.
The flower dome was less spectacular but still extremely good. Again the selfie brigade staring at a rose were probably as entertaining as the flora itself.
After this we started to walk away for a drinks break only to realise the skywalk was open. Excellent. Not very expensive at $8 and a wait for less than 10 minutes (you have allocated time slots). More amazing photos to be had.
Then finally at 7:45 (and again at 8:45) the light show. Amazing. Retro 70s music and stunning visuals. Well worth waiting for.
A really good afternoon",,
,,Must visit tourist attraction when in Singapore,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is definitely worth visiting when in Singapore whether you are coming during the daytime or evening time. Definitely should check out the Flower Dome (as there is a wide range of flowers that you get to see), Cloud Forest (the awesome waterfall centerpiece at the entrance is an attraction alone) & the OSBC Skyway 锛坕s also as it has the best view of Marina Bay Sands)",,
,,One word...stunning,5,,"You will lose a day here and it鈥檚 completely worthwhile, truly stunning in every way and there is so much to experience it is hard to put into words. The two domes are stunning, the 4D experience excellent.",,
,,Amazing but you need time!,4,,"You could spend a full day here! We didn鈥檛 have long enough. Two light shows at night, 7.45 and 8.45pm. Cloud Forrest is amazing. How do they get all those plants to grow and thrive under the same conditions even when they鈥檙e from opposing ends of the earth! Well worth the visit. Nearest walking MRT is Marina Bay which can be accessed via Bayfront MRT.",,
,,Lovely place to visit,4,,"Beautiful gardens. Lot of thought has gone into these gardens with solar panels in use and effort made to conserve energy. Covers a large area with variety in plants, trees, shrubs and water bodies.",,
,,Awe inspiring,5,,"Having visited GBTB in 2013 we were keen to visit again. The Floral Fantasy exhibit was truly out of this world. So many colours, sights and sounds and the 4D film at the end defies description. A must do!
The Cloud Dome and Floral Dome has had attractions added since our last visit and we were delighted to see the Australian collection in the Flower Dome, the plants look better than what we have in Perth.
Due to a tropical downpour we were unable to do the Sky Walk, hopefully that will be later in the week.",,
,,Taste of nature within,3,,The place was cool in fact!! Kids would love it! Very clean and neatt!! The trees pretty amazing and the pond!! As mentionned you should visit at night as the lights produce a way way better effect and change the type of experience you would have!!,,
,,a fantastic place at night,5,,"the show with,the music and the lights is impeccable and fun, technically well done, the garden itself is worth the walk, the flowers and plants are rich even the air is fragrant, even with a little rain, it's worth the visit, i'll do it again during the day",,
,,Great place to visit,5,,"Beautiful places, with great gardens, and different sceneries. a Must if you visit Singapore, gift shop is great, have very nice items, sellers are very nice and not pushy at all.",,
,,Amazing architectural and horticultural experience,5,,"The must see sight in Singapore. The geodomes are unbelievable, especially the Cloud Dome which has a huge waterfall. You travel from the top of the rainforest canopy to the jungle floor through varying vegetation. The structural artificial trees and aerial walkway are awesome and whatever you do don't miss the night time light show. You could easily spend a whole day there.",,
,,Great!,5,,Spent about an hour here before our flight. Hot day but inside the domes was cold! Beautiful gardens.,,
,,Not cheap but worth it,5,,Flower Dome beautiful but loved the Cloud Forest even though suffer from vertigo and had to be lead by my husband in a few points. Most impressive,,
,,Indoor waterfall,4,,"We visited on our last day in Singapore, we enjoyed walking through the two large glass houses. The sculptures amongst the flowers are beautiful to look at. The cloud forest was our favourite with its paths that weave around the waterfall. My 9 year old enjoyed exploring and finding out facts from the information boards.",,
,,Beautiful at night,5,,Lovely destination for a nighttime stroll with friends or as a couple. Very safe. Beautifully illuminated and you won鈥檛 have to compete with the crowds for photos. Fantastic in the day also.,,
,,Simply stunning,5,,"Broke the gardens trip into two parts, went to Flower Dome, Cloud Forest and Skyway early in the morning. Caught train to Bayfront and walked to garden entry. Purchased tickets for Flowerdome and Cloud Forest, then caught shuttle to Flowerdome. Wasn't expecting too much, but was very surprised. Flowerdome was excellent and Cloud Forest was spectacular, make sure you are there on the hour when the misting happens. Both Flowerdome and Cloud Forest are air conditioned. Skyway was nice and quiet during the morning, nice walk back from SuperTrees to Bayfront Station. Went to the light show as few days later and it was very busy. Entry to the show is free. Find the Supertree with the restaurant on top and lay on the ground to watch the show, simply stunning. Line for Skyway was way too long at night time.",,
,,Touristic - but a Must See,5,,"Green, flowers, nice view, garden is free of charge, just pay for the tree top walk. Take time, it's very restful after a day at down town",,
,,Amazing Gardens,5,,Nice experience to walk around in the air-conditioned environment looking at all the plants and trees from all over the world. Ideally you would be needing a 2 to 3 hours to comfortably see the place.,,
,,Stunning gardens in air conditioned domes!,4,,"The cloud forest was amazing, flower dome a bit underwhelming and the light show was incredible! Check it out from the marina bay sands observation deck for the best view",,
,,Beautiful,5,,I loved it out was like a mini out door Vegas experience. Everyone lay on the ground looking up admiring these avatar like trees. So beautiful and we got to see the light show from our hotel room also.,,
,,"Amazing to visit, very crowded but worth seeing",4,,This place is amazing. Cost was S$28 for a coach to pick us up from hotel and drop to front area of Gardens. The flower dome was crowded but you could move through easily enough. Loved the cactus area with all the different varieties. The colours of all the different types of tulips were like looking at a carpet made from a rainbow. The dome was cooler than I expected so good to get out of the heat of the day. Would recommend a visit here,,
,,Lovely and beautiful,5,,"I enjoyed every moment here. Very beautiful scenery and the flowers, oh so breathtaking. You MUST come here when in Singapore. Absolute MUST!",,
,,Simply awesome....!!!,5,,"Kindly check the garden special attractions when you are visiting the gardens. Throughout the year 2019, they have planned different attractions at different time intervals.",,
,,Amazed,5,,"Our visit to the Gardens by the Bay was fantastic. Let me be honest i鈥檓 not a gardener and not interested in plants...at all....but these indoor climate controlled gardens are spectacular. The glass domes made for a wonderful experience and i did appreciate the different themes and how well done the displays were, This is an absolute must if visiting Singapore, we ended up spending about two hours in both domes.",,
,,Well worth a visit,5,,"One of the most extensive collection of flowers, plants and trees on offer under two separate domes. It is simply breathtaking and well worth your time for a visit. It does tend to get a bit chilly in there (well, at least when I was around), so keep that in mind while you enjoy the wonders of nature.",,
,,Well worth a visit,5,,"We travelled to the Gardens by subway and enjoyed wandering around the various parts of the landscaped area. Although it was busy it never felt crowded. We stayed to watch the light show in the evening and it was quite spectacular, with a wonderful range of music and co-ordinated light effects on the massive tree installations.",,
,,Fabulous,5,,"We thoroughly enjoyed the aerial and botanical gardens. Avoid the heat of the day, so you can enjoy the gardens without being overwhelmed by the heat. Very interesting gardens.",,
,,We enjoyed this tour and the loveley scents!,5,,Excellent place to tour and view the Marina Bay Sands hotel from below. The location is excellent and very clean. It can get a little crowded but we enjoyed the break from the heat. If you are a gardner you will love the flowers and the displays.,,
,,Simply amazing,4,,The layout of this garden is an engineering feat. The plants are well labelled and grouped attractively. the one way walking track assists in fluid movement around the displays.,,
,,THE GARDEN OF DELIGHT,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is a huge, colourful, futuristic park in the bay area of Singapore. The park consists of three waterfront gardens: Bay South Garden, Bay East Garden, and Bay Central garden. This flower dome is the largest glass greenhouse in the world. Imagine a place that is always spring where flowers are constantly in bloom, and the sweet fragrance fills the air. I was so impressed by the beauty of this garden. it's like I just stepped into the garden of Eden, literally. The flower dome is like heaven on earth with plants and trees from eight different regions around the world. The place is so calming and so relaxing, you just got to breathe it in. A truly remarkable experience indeed! It's a must see attraction when in Singapore.",,
,,8.45pm Supertree Grove!!!,5,,"Whilst there is the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest that I would highly recommend, we didn't visit it this time. However, the free light show at 8.45pm is brilliant. You can watch the 8pm Spectra light show at Marina Bay and then walk to the Gardens by the Bay from there by walking straight under the Helix bridge. Just follow everyone else. Lots of people do this combo and it's so worth it as both light shows are free. Dinner beforehand at Gluttons by the bay or the food court in Marina Bay Shoppes is also good. My 3yo son and both my husband and I loved the light show at gardens by the bay. It goes for about 15 mins and is wonderful to just rest and be immersed and lost in the moment. Lights are timed and so beautifully to the music. I went 3 times during this trip and loved it. Again, Singapore exceeds my expectation.",,
,,Beautiful!,5,,So much to see and do here - allow plenty of time to explore this magnificent area. The highlight for our family was the Rhapsody Light show in the evening - just beautiful.,,
,,Definitely worth the visit,5,,I visited the Gardens by the Bay! Definitely recommend visiting this place! The gardens are amazing and a great place for young kids!,,
,,Trademark of Singapore,4,,"This is highly recommend as it offers variety of flowers, trees from across the world. You will see trees of Africa, Amazon. You can visit both during day and night but evening is preferable.

It's a good place to take your children , there are enough washroom available.

Normally crowded in weekends. But it is a must visit place in Singapore.",,
,,Enjoyable place,5,,"There鈥檚 so much to see. You can practically spend the whole day there. They have the flower doom, cloud forest, floral fantasy, skywalk around the super trees and vast gardens for you to explore ftom morning till night",,
,,Sensational,5,,Well worth the visit. we spent 3 days here but could have spent all week. great gardens and attractions,,
,,JUst Magnificant,5,,"You can't go to Singapore without seeing the Gardens By The Bay. There is so much to see (all for free) with loads of different garden areas and pathways to follow. Lots of amenities, water coolers/drinking fountains to keep you going.",,
,,Must see,5,,Absolutely exquisite and magnificent. Flower dome is amazing. I鈥檝e never felt closer to nature in my life.,,
,,Awesome,5,,Great place to visit. Take your time and take in what it has to offer. All air conditioned. Clean. Family friendly.,,
,,GARDENS BY THE BAY,5,,Stunning Gardens to visit and a must see too. Amazing display and presentation at so many levels within the larger building. Ingenious presentation of so many plants.,,
,,nice place to relax after seeing the shops at Marina Bay Sands,4,,It does not take long to go through the gardens. It is very pleasant place to relax after shopping or other activities around the bay. If you are at the bay you want to take the short walk to see this.,,
,,"Excellent to visit both day and night, you won鈥檛 be disappointed!",5,,"By far one of my favorite places in Singapore to visit, I could go over and over again! The flower dome is just spectacular! During my visit there was a special 鈥淭ulip Mania鈥?display that was just gorgeous! I went to Gardens By The Bay three times during in five days, one of those times was in the evening. It is something everyone should put on their list to see in my opinion. Every restroom I used was spotless, there were a lot of people but there were never any crowds and taking photos was never a problem. The days I was there the heat-humidity index was 108 yet there was enough under cover, air conditioned areas that it all was really ok. The flower dome is nicely cooled and very comfortable.",,
,,"Beautiful, interesting and absolutely worthwhile",5,,We spent a morning here with our two girls and it absolutely didn't disappoint. In my opinion you cannot visit Singapore and not see the Gardens by the bay - definitely worth a visit,,
,,"Just do it, you won鈥檛 be dissatisfied!",5,,Probably one of my favourite places in all of Singapore! We have been every year since opening and i am always amazed!,,
,,A MUST visit!,5,,"Do not miss a walk through the gardens when visiting Singapore. Beautiful day and night. Follow me on Instagram for more pics, videos and reviews @gentlemans_journeys",,
,,Cheap entertainment.,4,,Beautiful gardens and views of the city a top the Marina Bay Sands hotel. The cloud forest is a cool escape from the heat and the paths around the waterfall boast some of the most amazing botany.,,
,,Amazing Place,4,,"Well worth visiting, we went during the day and came back at night for the light show, simply amazing!!",,
,,Beautiful!,5,,"Besides housing the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome, this ""park"" has many other smaller gardens showing displays from many different countries. It is definitely worth a walk-through, even on a hot and sultry Singapore day (better of course if there's a breeze, but...)",,
,,very inspiring,5,,"Four of us from a cruise ship went the gardens in a set price limo from the cruise ship, WE should have taken a metered cab as we paid far to much for the short journey.
THe gardens are not open until nine am, but we could do all of thhe wakinng areas from five am so there was plennty to look at until we paid to hhave a ride of about 30 minutes in a little tram to hhave a good look about. If some amazing structures containing plants and some great layouts are of interest them it is worth the tim. There is no coffee until nine am.",,
,,There is a lot to see and feel...,5,,"These are amazing gardens with the layout having great ambiance, flowers and plenty of places to sit. Go there and see it both day and the light & sound show at night.",,
,,Great trip,5,,"Nice scenery on the gardens! Staff was helpful in giving directions, not only standing there. Stay by the bay was also amazing,not only the atmosphere but the food as well",,
,,Beautiful,5,,Serene and inspiring. Beautiful place to visit and rest. Also provides a break from the heat and humidity.,,
,,love the garden,5,,Garden in the middle of the concrete jungle! Kudos to Singapore for building this garden. It's a breath of fresh air amid the hustle and bustle of the city.,,
,,Amazing,5,,"Wonderful place, great for all ages and a nice escapes from the heat if you go into the domes. We love it here and visit every time we come to Singapore",,
,,Flower Dome is breathtaking,5,,"Could have spent hours in here. It鈥檚 hard not to want to touch everything though - the plants are Devine. Kids enjoyed it as well but probably could have taken slot longer walking through without them.

The List City at the top of the Cloud Dome was also in incredible.

Finish your night at Satay On The Bay. Everything we tried was tasty and the Tiger Beer icy cold.",,
,,Family friendly and great show,4,,"Great architecture, easy walking around, splendid light and music show on the steel trees, topped off by sstays by the bay.",,
,,2 lovely air conditioned greenhouses,5,,Lovely afternoon wandering around the gardens and greenhouses. We went back later in the evening to see the light show..well worth it,,
,,"Incredible experience, one of the best in the last decade",5,,"Even if you are short of time, even if it is raining, even if you are tired you must come and visit the Gardens. Normally I never put the highest point to any hotel, restaurant or attraction place. However, this is something you鈥檒l never forget - the construction itself, park around, flowers which impress you one after another, etc. Very well organized, with wonderful explanations, with beautiful waterfalls and hundreds of places to take picture. The must experience in Singapore, and is good to visit with friends, with kids, in couples or alone. Magnificent place! I will come one day back to Singapore just to repeat this experience.",,
,,Beautiful cooling scenery,5,,Better to go during day time as photos taken are nice in the cloud forest and flower dome. Cloud forest have waterfall and flower dome have cactus and many colourful flowers. Buy tickets for those two at a cheaper price. Expect a little long queue at cloud forest. Will go to flower dome again. Do take note not to touch and step on the flowers,,
,,Name says it all,2,,"The name says it all , if you are plant lover and than this is it for you. perhaps a place to safe guard nature for future generations but not worth the money.",,
,,Worth it!,5,,"This place is fab!
We were a group of 10, 6 adults and 4 kids aged 11,12,13,14. There is so much to see!
We bought an online package through Klook for the Cloud Dome and Flower place as well as the Skyway walk for about $28 per adult or something.
On the day we went my niece was really sick but still wanted to go, but was exhausted walking around so we tried to get her a wheelchair. They hire them out for $2, just need photo ID (AU drivers licence was ok) but only to the elderly. So we got my Mum (62yrs) to pretend it was for her and then when we got to the domes they switched over.
The domes are amazing and you really need to allow at least an hour for each one.
We had planned to do it all on one night but ran out of time to do the Sky walk so we went back a 2nd night to do that. We got there about 7pm hoping to catch the light show at 7:45 and then do the walk however, we didn't realise even though we had a ticket, we had to get a time slot ticket. The earliest we could get was 8:40pm. So we found a spot to watch the light show and then waited until 8:20 to line up for the Skyway. The bonus of this was that while up there the 2nd viewing of the light show started so we got to see it from the ground as well as the top. It is a fabulous place and you can spend a lot of time there if you want. If you go between 11am-1pm they have driverless cars!! Going in the evening was great seeing it by day and leaving by night and it was just a stroll over to the Shoppes at Marina Bay where you can catch the 8pm or 9pm light show them head to Rasapura for dinner. Perfect!",,
,,Fantastic experience,5,,"Went to the night light show and it was unbelievable , well worth the trip . Keith was the tour guide and was very knowledge and added so much value to the trip .",,
,,Beautiful gardens,5,,Impressive gardens with two domes for flowers and higher climate plants - stunning exhibition and easy to see everything. Very well organised. Large outdoor area to explore too. Must see the super trees and the light show in the evenings. Highly recommend as one of the must sees in Singapore!,,
,,Awe must visit,5,,It's very beautiful place and you can spend two hours easily.. The show is very nice.. I can say it's heart of Singapore,,
,,Loved it!,5,,"What a cool place - loved walking around the entire Gardens. Some great views and photo spots, plus some unusual things to buy in the gift shop in addition to the typical souvenirs.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,Very very beautiful. Peaceful and relaxing. The show was very nice. Kids loved to watch and dance even.,,
,,Its amazing!,5,,Its such a beautiful experience and its really beautiful. Highly recommend a visit there in the evening and stay watch the show!,,
,,Excellent Tourist Location,5,,Amazing greenery in the middle of the bustling city. Makes you want to go back again and again to escape from the heat. The Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest should not be missed.,,
,,A must see in Singapore,5,,Loved the cloud forest and the flower dome Gardens by the Bay. Great value for money. This time we also walked around in the outdoor Gardens and they were beautiful however it's very hot outside so make sure you take water and a hat. The Symphony of Lights nighttime show was amazing.,,
,,Amazing!!,5,,"An absolute must - we did it all, Cloud Forest, Flower Dome, Skywalk and the light show. Love love love. Beautiful space and brilliantly kept. A must see!",,
,,Wonderful way to spend an afternoon,4,,"Easy to get there via the MRT, getting out at Bayfront station. The two domes are air conditioned which is fantastic to spend a lot of time wandering around looking at the flowers, cactus, succulents and trees.",,
,,New Attraction at Garden By the Bay - The New Garden is Floral Fantasy ...,4,,"Floral Fantasy is the new garden at Garden By The Bay. To enjoy this new creation, maybe is to immerse in that moment and feel the beauty in a different way.

A relaxing place to be in and good for those who doesn鈥檛 have much time to visit the other attractions in Garden By The Bay. Plus it is very near to the Bayfront MRT station, good for those who doesn鈥檛 want to walk too much. You can also enjoy light bites at the little nice cosy cafe - Cafe Aster, with beautiful view and the pricing is reasonable and affordable. Or get some unique items from the Gift Shop.

There鈥檚 a 4D Ride 鈥?Flight of the Dragonfly in the Floral Fantasy. Feeling the amazing flight patterns of the dragon fly, it鈥檚 able to change direction swiftly, gliding through the air with no apparent effort. This beautiful little insect has a beautiful spiritual meaning - the dragonfly totem carries the wisdom of transformation and adaptability in life!",,
,,So interesting,5,,"I could only pick 10 photos! There are sooooo many more! This place has so much to see, you can鈥檛 really do it all in one day. The gardens are spectacular! When the heat and humidity get to be too oppressive, buy your ticket for the Cloud Dome or the Flower Dome, they are both freezing inside and it felt sooo good. The Cloud Dome has this huge waterfall right inside the entrance, which was fun to walk around and up to the top of. The Flower Dome has a very diverse exhibit of flowers, they are from all over the world, from Baobabs in Africa to cherry blossoms from Japan. It is amazing how they get all of them to grow in basically the same climate.

Now, if you want to go onto the OCBC Skywalk in the Supertree Grove, you absolutely have to buy a ticket. I think you can buy in advance, but definitely do not walk up to the ticket office when you want to go. There was a 2 hour wait when we went. There is also a restaurant in the tallest one, Indochine, which would allow you to have a similar view. They did a light show with classical music that was really fun to see. Definitely recommend this attraction.

You can get here by cab or bus, or you can walk through the Marina Bay Sands shops and hotel, which isn鈥檛 too bad.",,
,,Beautiful by night,5,,We visited the gardens by night to see a fantastic light and sound show. It is definitely worth going if you are in Singapore,,
,,A Destination in its own right,5,,You shouldn鈥檛 just decide to go when you are in Singapore you should go to Singapore to visit these Gardens.Go and see them they are fabulous,,
,,Nice place,5,,"This is a very nice place to visit. We spent a very enjoyable day there. By tickets to the indoor domes, and if you have kids visit the kids area / playground.
Also spent the dollars on the shuttle to save you some steps in the day heat.",,
,,Stunning gardens,5,,Excellent gardens with a range of stunning plants and flowers. Lovely morning out. Well worth visiting these gardens. We went 9am and the crowds were not that busy. Later the queues were busier. Get there early if you can.,,
,,Supertrees! A must see in Singapore,5,,"Entrance to the gardens is free but you need to purchase tickets to the flower dome and the cloud domes. We visited the cloud dome which was stunning but the real stars of the show here are the Supertrees. We visited at night to see the light show at Supertree Grove, I didn't really know what to expect but it was out of this world! Definitely a must see for anyone visiting Singapore.",,
,,Gardens by the bay,5,,"Fantastic place to visit day or night You will not be disappointed Do the skywalk, the bar at the top of a Super tree , and the not to be missed music and light show (free) every night",,
,,Best tourist attraction!!,5,,"The Floral fantasy attraction for April is wonderful! So colourful, beautiful art work of flowers. The cloud forest is a great display of tropical plants and the ever changing flower dome seems more touristy but well planned. The gardens themselves are free to wonder around in with cafes, gift shops and drink stands available. Stunning views, incredible grounds keeping of the Singapore people.",,
,,Best thing to do!!,5,,"Absolutely stunning! A real must do when in Singapore. We did both domes which I would recommend. They are so well presented and also provide a little break from the sticky heat outside. Unfortunately we spent so long in the domes we ran out of time to do the tree walk, next time!!
Photo heaven.",,
,,Must see this !,5,,"Had a wonderful day here in both the greenhouses.

Great exhibits in both the rainforest dome and the Flower Dome.

Lots of information about environmental damage and ways we can help including information boards exhibits and video films. The domes are self sustaining so they practice what they preach.

Beautiful planting and sculptures within a fantastic modern design and the architecture of the structures is fascinating.

Wear good walking shoes as there is a lot to see!

There is a shuttle train($3 ), to take you to the domes if you want to save your feet but it's only a 15 minute walk from the ticket office.

You must visit the highest indoor waterfall !

There is a restaurant serving variety of dishesfir lunch and also an informal cafe for simpler food and drink.

We had a great day here. I would say value for money as it kept us entertained for around 4 or 5 hours.

Good labels on the planting in the Flower Dome so would be great for avid gardeners and anyone with a general interest in art and the natural world.

Very sobering thoughts about the state if the environment but ends on a positive note giving advice on how we can change our behaviour to reduce the risks to the planet

Lovely grounds. There is a guided tour train around the grounds in the afternoon at extra cost that looked very good too.",,
,,Amazing,5,,A stunning place to behold. The domes were incredible. And with two hot tired children discovering the Children's garden with free waterpark to play in was awesome.,,
,,Beautiful,5,,I really enjoyed the place. Free to walk outdoors but you need to get tickets to get indoors. Lovely trees and flowers from all over the world.,,
,,Amazing experience,5,,"Gardens by the bay were an amazing experience
Price to enter domes were very cheap great value
it was so beautiful the only issues was we didn't have enough time
I suggest 2 days
the light show was gorgeous we views it from the bridge entering
from the hotel",,
,,Beautiful tropical gardens and indoor botanical colllections,5,,"An amazing place with so many plants, sculptures, and attractions to see. The skywalk and the indoor attractions are a must see. A romantic place to take your loved one too. We had a wonderful visit.",,
,,Amazing construction and free light show,5,,"Return visit after a number of years and the plant development was amazing The two domes are amazing constructions To walk in and be confronted by a massive indoor waterfall was a real treat To then go to the top and spiral down with views on one side of the plants and then the harbour was a wonderful experience
It is typical of Singapore that the light show with an accompanying soundtrack was totally free It was fun sitting on the lawn surrounded by local and tourists all enjoying the performance",,
,,Magical indeed,5,,"The garden is actually open to public. Only the Flower Dome (air conditioned) and Cloud Forest (air conditioned) and OCBC Skyway (open air) is pay to enter. Do allocate minimum 1 hour for each dome as you need time to look at the plants, snap thousands of pictures, not forgetting the crowds as well. I spent approximately 3 hours for all 3 attractions and even skipped a few educational program offered in each dome, I visited during midday which the sun if most ferocious, thankful that this is an indoor air-conditioned garden, it certainly helped the scorching heat outside.

We are also lucky that the week we went have a garden of Tulips, colourful Tulips.

Re-entry is possible for each dome, just get the stamp on your hand while exiting, you can return anytime only on that day.

The OCBC Skyway, I would suggest a sunset time as there are light show I believe and it is not that hot compared to morning and midday.

Tourist can get their tickets at the airport booth that are selling, tickets purchase on-site are normal price, somewhat 30%-40% more expensive. Even online does sell these tickets and they are authorised such as travelrecommends.com and klook.com.

An activity well spent and its an attraction highly recommended for first time tourist!",,
,,Beautiful place,5,,Recommended for you if you travel to singapore. Beautiful place ever. Easy to go there. Just use mrt to bayfront and walk to gardens by the bay.,,
,,Out of the World !!,5,,The sheer # of reviews for this speaks volumes. The best blend of nature and human.. The light shows are the best free ones I ever seen. Absolutely stunning and extremely well maintained.,,
,,Gardens by the Bay lights Show,5,,"If you are staying in Singapore overnight then you must not miss the Light Show put on in the Gardens by the Bay. This starts at 7.45pm every night and admission is free. The easiest way to get there is by taxi which drops you off at the entrance. The walk in isn't too long and is accessible by everyone. It pays to get there a little early as every man and his dog goes an positions fill up!
The lights which are accompanied by music are absolutely fabulous and are not to be missed. If you have the time during your stay the Marina Bay Sands also has a light show which starts at 8pm and 9pm.",,
,,Amazing plants in large conservatories,5,,"I wish I'd understood that there are 2 large conservatories. We spent too much time in one and then found the next one was even more spectacular. One has plants from all over the world in various settings, the other is a huge mountain of rain-forest type plants with large waterfall. You can climb up using easy spiral walk to the top of the waterfall. Great spot.",,
,,Tulip exhibition,5,,Wonderful bright colours but a huge Easter crowd making it a little less pleasurable to wander than normal,,
,,AMAZING,5,,This is the best garden you will ever see that is man made.The detail is close to perfection and the set out is the best. Give youself a full day to explore this Amazing garden.,,
,,Absolutely beautiful,5,,"This place is definitely worth a look, there is quite a lot to see so make sure you have a few hours to spare.
There are 2 big domes which cost money to get into but worth it as they are air conditioned for a start. The displays in these domes are magnificent, the cloud dome has a huge waterfall inside and the flower dome is full of beautiful flower displays.
The most spectacular display is at night when they have the light show. This is totally amazing, something you don't want to miss.",,
,,Lots of perople on a weekend - big crowds. Many Plants!,3,,The best thing about this is that the entire dome is airconditioned which makes a nice respite from the oppressive humidity and you get to kill few hours viewing plants you wouldn't ordinarily see. Kind of got boring for me after 2 hours though. Helps if you like plants and crowds.,,
,,Peacful & Relaxing,5,,"The gardens are huge and well maintained. There are many areas to sit and stare at the beautiful gardens, lake & fountains. An escalator to take you down to the ground level, stairs & lifts to get around. A ""village bus"" also takes you around to the main areas, additional cost for the bus. You can spend many hours wandering looking at the plants. The super trees are amazing, the flower dome, all generate their own power and water. Great technology and a great place to visit",,
,,Good half day trip,4,,"You can easily spend half a day here taking pictures of the super trees, wandering the gardens. Keep in mind that some attractions within will require an entrance fee. The gardens are well connected to public transit and offer some of best views of the marina area.",,
,,Beautiful man made marvel,5,,"Beautiful place to visit, be it day or night. I especially love the super trees lit up at night. Be sure to catch the free light and sound shows and then u can head over to Marina Bay Sands to get some dinner after the show is over. There is a connecting bridge that will take u straight to the shoppes",,
,,Mr,5,,Well worth visiting!! Quite astonishing landscape with a vast array of trees shrubs etc. that simply relish the climate.,,
,,The Eden project of the far East,5,,"This was a delightful surprise. A taste of many different flora under one roof and so beautifully arranged to give a whole experience of world flora in it's natural setting. difficult to leave. The orchids, who ever knew there were so many. The rain forrest with a magnificant waterfall and plants in their natural setting. Spent the whole afternoon there. Not to be missed but outside the special domes, it is very hot and humid, that said fast entry to all special domes but lots of walking. There are seats to rest and lifts for those needing extra help. keep bottle of water handy and comfotable walking shoes. can be wet in places where wind may blow the waterfall. Incidently the highest I have ever seen,",,
,,best,5,,it was mesmerising. Amazing place. So much to see. Worth all the hype and money. I want to revisit this place if i go singapore again.,,
,,A gem in the city,5,,"What a fabulous place! You can walk around the gardens free of charge. What you have to pay for is the forest dome, cloud forest, the tallest tree bar and the high level walkway. Just take your time! The different places you see and the smells are brilliant, To tell you would ruin it so I鈥檓 not, only to say you will love to visit the gardens and you will come back as you won鈥檛 get the chance to see everything and you鈥檇 want to visit other places again. An absolute must for garden lovers and those who want a little piece and quiet. Start early morning and check for any closing times of the domes - the flower dome was shut on the day we went, lucky for us it was just next door but it might not be for you. 100% recommend.",,
,,Most wonderful Gardens.,5,,"An awesome display of environmental technology enabling displays of plants from all over the world. Thought we would be there 3 hours spent 9 and could have happily gone back the next day. Very impressed with Singapore, it's people and its efforts to reduce their carbon footprint. Gardens by the bay a must see.",,
,,Education 4 sustainability done beautifully in Singapore,5,,"What better way to show the world that your country believes in planning for a sustainable future than by building something as amazing as Gardens by the Bay... yes there are super trees and waterfalls and all sorts of amazing sights like floating baby sculptures, but underneath it all is a solid framework of environmental education that is inspiring 鉂わ笍",,
,,Thanks,4,,"Fun for all of us, even the non garden aficionados. One of us did the paid flower garden tour, I did the children's garden and a general walk around. A good way to kill a morning in Singapore.",,
,,Worth 1 Visit,4,,"Worth the time to go to the domes one for the flowers one for the tree walk. Gets you out of the heat. Family did enjoy the high walks in the tree walk. I had to chicken out.
Two bad points most of the staff on mobile phones and seemed disinterested.
And please don鈥檛 lecture me on the climate change hoax in a dome that chews more power just to be constantly air conditioned.",,
,,One of the most beautiful gardens in the world!,5,,"I have wanted to see this garden for some years but never found the time. Today my husband and I finally went and we鈥檙e not disappointed. It is the most beautiful botanical garden we have ever seen. The variety of blooms, the way everything is arranged and shown shows great care and inventiveness.

This is one place NOT TO BE MISSED when visiting Singapore. See all the sights Flower Dome, Cloud Forrest and OCBC Skyway along with any other special showing.",,
,,Must do in Singapore,5,,"This is a fabulous attraction and definitely well worth a visit. We visited as part of our hop on hop off bus tour, and had scoped the gardens out from the top of the Marina Bay sands hotel. Wandering through the gardens is beautiful, and free. We happily paid for the Flower and Cloud domes and they were well worth every penny. The flower dome was unexpectedly cool on a hot day, and along with the gorgeous planting, there were lots of sculptures to admire. The cloud dome was fabulous with the subtropical plants and the giant waterfall. We ran out of time to get up to the viewing platform and we鈥檒l do that next time. We came back at night for the free light show which was truly spectacular and worth the hassle of a taxi there.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,This place is a must see when in Singapore. We spent a few hours here wandering around the beautiful gardens & waterways.,,
,,"Amazing, Beautiful, and Creative.",5,,"Gardens By The Bay is the reason I incorporated a stop over in Singapore. This is an amazing place and beautiful experience. The design of the gardens and two indoor domes is extremely creative. You need to purchase tickets to get inside the two domes, Flower Fantasy and the Skywalk. Purchase them online ahead of your visit to get good discounts and avoid the queues. If you can only afford to see one of the domes then I recommend you visit the Cloud Forest. The outside gardens are free. I spent five hours at the Gardens including a lunch break in the food hall. There are many places to eat. It is well set up. Be sure to give yourselves time to stroll around and take in the gardens. You could easily do two half days is you have the time.
Children are well catered for in the Children鈥檚 Garden. There is a fabulous adventure playground in amongst the bush so provides plenty of shade. Remember to take swimming togs and towel for the children to play in the kiddies fountains. Your children will thank you for it and you will appreciate happy children! Take water and snacks to keep everyone hydrated and happy.
Currently it is very hot and humid in Singapore so I recommend you go early in the morning or later in the afternoon to avoid the midday sun and take an umbrella to keep you protected. The sun & humidity is pretty fierce at the moment. If you want to see the Supertree Light Show then time your visit around for when the 15min show starts at 7:45 or 8:45 in the evening.",,
,,Spectacular,5,,The new Garden Rhapsody light and sound display starting at 8pm is a must. The choreography of the lights and sounds are amazing. The walk through the gardens is free of charge but there is a fee to view the Rain Forest and Flower Dome but both of these a worth doing before the light show. We walked around the gardens for some time after the show with a gentle breeze blowing through our hair it was stunning and the view over the water to the Singapore Flyer was amazing. A beautiful place to relax.,,
,,Holiday,5,,Very beautiful garden and quite entertaining. We enjoy the light show which occurs each 45 minutes. Quite a range of flower .The flower museum and the cloud garden is interesting as well. Reccomended,,
,,Beautiful garden great for photography,4,,Love this garden which is a favourite spot for wedding photography. Enjoy the greenery and flowers only that the afternoon heat can be really hot so bring your water bottle to hydrate yourself. Wear comfy shoes and be prepared to walk . Great to have a stroll there. There is satay club nearby if u like to have some local food.,,
,,A Green Lung amidst a Concrete Jungle,5,,"My Aussie frens wanted to visit and as it was a longtime since I last visit..y not..We went on a Saturday and it was teeming with people..We wondered through the themes gardens and towards the Supertrees. My frens were impressed by the lush greenery and the wide variety of plants. So when in Singapore, do visit the Gardens..A welcome respite from the heat and concrete jungle that is Singapore.",,
,,amazingly spectacular,5,,"whilst in singapore in febuary we came across this amazing place first of all there is a beautiful calmness before you walk through the gardens the flowers .trees wonderful lakes and bridges are all free!!! then we paid 24 singapore dollars each to gain admission to the gardens flower dome,which was cooling to be in after the heat outside the arrangements were truly breathtaking ,and the cloud dome is really impossible to describe .a wonderful experience not to be missed",,
,,A great afternoon,5,,"Two couples, we thoroughly enjoyed all the different gardens and the tulip show, together with all the stalls based on Holland, the afternoon was definitely well worth it - very enjoyable.",,
,,What an amazing place,5,,Thai place was one of the best experiences in my entire life totally free and a day full of wonder totally worth the time no effort because the cloud dome is impossible to describe and is a beautiful educational experience for anyone no matter what you like or dislike.,,
,,Sakura Matsuri 2019,5,,"It was my first time at the Gardens' Flower Dome as my mom loves flowers and she could not travel to Japan for the cherry blossoms. She loves the different types of cherry blossoms and the beautiful Japanese theme.
Queuing for tickets was an amazing breeze with many staff around to help.",,
,,Very crowded don't expect to stop and smell the roses,2,,"Really disappointed to be honest. Ticket pricing is complicated but I recommend you get the ""bus"" return ticket included as well as entry to the flower dome, sky walk and rainforest. Staff were very grumpy and not helpful. It was extremely crowded (dangerously so) so you could not stop to take many photos or see the exhibits. All very rushed as you need to follow the crowds (there seems to be one way to walk around it's like Ikea on a weekend...hellish)
Would not return as I say maybe it's incredible when it's quiet but staff told us it never is quiet so don't waste your money. Take photos from outside it's just as impressive",,
,,Beautiful park - humidity argh!,4,,"Went to the Gardens By The Bay for a good wander, it was recommended by so many people, it鈥檚 definitely worth the trip!
Get off at Bayfront MTR, and make your way via the underpass, when you get to the top of the stairs (yes there is an elevator) you are greeted by the ticket office - the park itself is free, but you need to pay for the skywalk and the indoor gardens (the Cloud and the flower garden). And do get them......but I would advise either through your hotel or something like Klook, you save like 25%.
The park is huge - get a map, I have been told it鈥檚 amazing at night, I went in the day (less mosquitos), you can get a shuttle ($3sg), or just walk.
I happened to walk on one of the most humid days so far in 2019, weather blows two extremes started the day torrential rain and thunder, when I left for the park sunny skies and 33c......but the water has to go somewhere!?!?
Sweating bullets all day.
The skywalk is okay, great views across the park, essential, maybe, maybe not......I thought 鈥榤eh鈥?
I was impressed though with the 2 indoor gardens - might have been something to do with the strong AC (who knew Cactus liked AC!?) but I loved it......
All in plenty of things to see and learn. Good afternoon trip.",,
,,110% recommended,5,,I am not a flower fan or plant fan but this was a beautiful experience and all in lovely AC comfort. The teams do a fantastic job to have a wide selection of plants and sculptures,,
,,Gorgeous Gardens By The Bay,5,,"Beautiful place, we arrived around 3pm so we could meander, dont forget to get a stamp so you can reenter the domes, worth seeing during the day and at night with the lights, supertree light show definitely worth watching - spectacular !! We ate at Satay by the Bay - there are signposts to find this - yummy food great service. If you are lucky you can find otters making there way out of the bay across the footpaths on the outside of the flower dome",,
,,"Incredibly underwhelming, overrated!!",2,,"I had high hopes, everyone raves about this place. I wonder if they've never seen plants before? It was sooooo overrated and underwhelming. The only good part of it was the waterfall, it was nice to see. But still overcrowded. You are jammed in like sardines. The rest of the gardens aas a bore, especially flower some. At 28Sg Per person, we can see beautiful gardens for free in Australia... The tulips weren't even very impressive there weren't that many of them. Overall, it was a huge snorefest and I personally wouldn't bother unless you're a flower and plant fanatic. Otherwise, you're just walking through a garden, where some plants are fake.",,
,,Floral Fantasy,5,,Absolutely wonderful part of Gardens of the Bay. Only for a limited time but would high recommend. Better than the other 2 conservatories. The 4D show was excellent.,,
,,A must do,5,,We were many times in Singapore but never in the gardens by the bay...and I can only recommend it. It is a fantastic outing and as the domes are air conditioned it is very pleasant to be in there.,,
,,Beautiful Greenspace,5,,"I spent all day wandering around here. Going through the Cloud Forest dome and Flower dome, as well as the Super Tree Groves. It is a beautiful space in the city. If you鈥檙e there in the evening don鈥檛 miss the two performances at Supertree Grove, a spectacle of lights and music.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay . Supertrees,5,,Awesome light show. Need to get there early if you want to sit. Time to enjoy an icecream or get something to eat.,,
,,Sunset at Gardens By The Bay,5,,"Eady to get to using MRT. Catch Red line to Marina Bay then Yellow line to Bayfront.
At friends recommendation arrived a bit before sunset to experience daytime viewing and nightime lights. Open gardens are free. Visited the Flower Dome and Cloud Forrest ($28 to visit both). Amazing to see different enviroments on such a massive scale with air con providing relief from tropic humidity! Light show was very impressive. Every ckean and tidy and staff friendly and helpful",,
,,Ok,4,,"The cloud dome was interesting. In the flower dome there was a tulip display. It was great to see all the colors & blooms. The flower dome was much smaller than expected.
I鈥檝e been to many amazing botanical gardens this one had too many man made things. I feel if you are going to teach about something in nature you should display the real thing not man made replicas.",,
,,Garden walk,4,,"I took a very nice and relaxing walk atound the Gardens by the bay. Though the weather was hot and humid, the green in the garden was refreshing and cooling. A definately must visit in Singapore.",,
,,Wonderful,5,,"Beautiful , go upstairs the view and felling are great , you cannot miss this spot....full of thinks to visit",,
,,Simply outstanding,5,,Take time and wander and explore everything this location has to offer. There is no point typing loads of narrative - just go and love it! What a joy with access to the Metro too. Simply stunning day & night.,,
,,Get a scooter to whizz through it,5,,"I rented one of the electric pedal scooters, a great way to quickly appeciate this wonderful ammenity",,
,,Great attraction!,4,,"Not to be missed if you are a botanist and in Singapore for first time. They have huge waterfall, lots of flowers and trees. Please do not miss their evening rhapsody show, its a good experience but not the best. Overall, an attaraction not to be missed. Duration: 1-2 hours depending on your interest.",,
,,Nice place to visit,4,,"Its nice piece of greenery in Singapore. The conservatories are the main attraction of gardens by the bay. But I would recommend the super trees light show too, as I enjoyed that the most. Also you get the nice view of Singapore flyer from here. Overall nice place to visit.",,
,,Not a great attraction,1,,This is ok for people who has never seen trees and waterfalls. Lot of hard work by the constructors and maintainece staff. Themes are addressed well.,,
,,A must do in Singapore,5,,"This is absolutely amazing. We visited at night the music and lights are wonderful. It is a very special experience, come early and stay late.",,
,,Cloud forest,5,,Fabulous place to spend an hour or more. Cool and refreshing with the most wonderful lush greenery. It felt as if you were up there in the clouds.,,
,,Such a beautiful place!,5,,"Had a wonderful day at Gardens by the Bay. The beautiful , cool domes of the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome were a welcome retreat to explore during a warm Singapore day. Every part of the gardens is just perfect. So much care has been taken to preserve the trees and plants and create an environment where they can thrive and we can enjoy them. Loved it!",,
,,Must see,5,,Amazing place with beautiful structures. You need to purchase tickets for Cloud dome in advance or it might be sold out by the time you get here. The view is out of this world. Looks like you are on a different planet at times.,,
,,Amazing gardens - a must do!,5,,"Even if you are not into gardens, this is awesome. Walk through the park enjoying the lake, sculptures & landscaping. Then meander through the towers and take a walk along the connecting bridge. All in daylight - then be sure to come back for a brief visit at night to see them sparkle!",,
,,Great night out,5,,"We visited the Gardens by the Bay twice.
You need to do the day visit of the 2 Gardens. The large display of gardens of the world need to be seen followed by a visit to the cloud gardens. On a humid Singapore day you will enjoy the comfort of this controlled environment.
At night look for a tour taking in the light show at the gardens followed by a visit to the Marina bay Sands viewing platform on top of the 56 floor hotel. Walk through the shopping centre and then a boat ride down to the Key.
Very tiring day but something you have to do.",,
,,Amazing!,5,,"What an amazing experience! We brought our tickets online through Klook, no problems scanning our tickets from our mobile phone and purchased at a cheaper rate.

We visited the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome. Spent about 1.5 hours walking through these amazing air conditioned domes and loved every second. Afterwards we spent around 45 minutes in the water playground, our kids had a blast.

We really didn't have near enough time to see all that Gardens by the Bay has to offer but what we were able to do was amazing and great value.

A 'must do' when in Singapore.",,
,,Wow oh Wow,5,,"What an amazing place, well worth spending a day there. The indoor sections are climate controlled which makes for easy walking (I have COPD) I was amazed at how I coped. We ate at a lovely restaurant, The night light show - what can I say Wow, gorgeous, terrific. Getting there was also easy - Taxi there and a line up system for Taxi at the finish which was well organised and not a long wait -- plenty of taxi's available for large number of people.",,
,,Amazing,5,,"The Cloud Forest especially was incredible. We loved it. It is hard to describe but it is very well executed (and educational which I wasn't expecting.)

The flower dome was good, and we enjoyed the Tulip festival display that was on during our visit.

The flower fine was interesting, and there was a Tulip festival display on which was well executed.",,
,,Absolutely Outstanding,5,,A 'must do' when you are in Singapore. A trip up to the top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and then a wander through the two domed gardens. Beautifully created. You won't regret it.,,
,,A place for an Insta person,4,,So many nice landscape in one place. The place is huge we spent about 2.5 hours inside here for both Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. Don't need to worry about the weather because its an indoor garden house and fully air-conditioned. A MUST VISIT place in Singapore.,,
,,Amazing at night.,5,,This is a great place to wander around during the day but is also great at night. The light show was on at 7.45pm and also 8.45pm every night and was fantastic. Take a blanket or a towel and find a spot on the grass to lie down and look up without spraining your neck.,,
,,Ferris Wheel,5,,"In awe of the species there. So may fantastic colours, great waterfall, a photographer's paradise. Gorgeous, just gorgeous.",,
,,So beautiful,5,,"We were lucky enough to visit here.
So amazing to see what can be done in creating a beautiful garden.
They charge separately for each attraction within the garden and it鈥檚 expensive.
We did really enjoy it - bring water as Singapore is a very hot place.",,
,,Cherry blossoms!,4,,While in Singapore we went to see gardens by the bay. Its actually air conditioned garden which is manmade yet comforting to see lot of variety. Witnessed cherry blossoms of Japan in March here which was beautifully done. One should visit it to beat the heat also.,,
,,Unreal Gardens,5,,This gardens is crazy and so nice. You can spend all day there without realising the time. The show in the evening is great and it free which is the best bit.,,
,,A wonderful place!,5,,"The place is good and very clean. You can enjoy it during the day, also at night with a light show. Definitely recommend it!",,
,,"Must see, impressive, find a good spot for Tree night Show",5,,"to visit Singapore and miss this amazing feature would be very sad. we spent entire day exploring the area, and in the evening, when suddenly everyone was finding a spot wherever they could we felt that something amazing might start soon. so we chose a spot on a small hillside and expected the show. don't remember the time, but it around 8pm when it was fully dark, the show started. it is indeed amazing to see those super trees light in different shades with the Marina Bay Sands hotel in the background. It was a sight to see. Maybe the view was better if you took spot right under the trees, maybe on the hanging bridge it was better (but one cannot predict the exact time when your turn to climb the hanging bridge will come even if you bought ticket for 8:30pm time you will might end up on the bridge at around 9pm). so if you want to see the tree light show from the hanging bridge between trees, then learn the time of the show, get the ticket for bridge for 30 mins earlier. Of course it might not work out, so if you take my advice, you also take full responsibility :)

Good luck!",,
,,Ok,4,,If your into architecture and horticulture I am sure you will enjoy this. If you are pushed for time and you are not really imto such things you could give it a miss. Reminded me of the Eden project.,,
,,Simply stunning!!!,5,,"Singapore has so many beautiful experiences to offer but this was by far my favourite. I visited Gardens by the Bay during the day and the evening and both have different things to offer. I visited the domes during the day and they exceeded all expectations, so beautiful and such a calm space to be. I spent time walking in the gardens in the evening and was lucky to catch a light and music show on the outside installations - captivating.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay - Cloud Forest & Flower Dome,5,,Highlight of the trip for me. Not a green thumb in anyway but fully enjoyed this spectacular place. Visited two conservatories Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. Good price. So much to see. Incredible displays of every plant from most climates in the world. The cloud forest is incredible and also has spectacular views.,,
,,Nice garden,4,,Went on the free tour offered by Singapore Airlines when transiting. The gardens were nice with a lot too see. Place is more vibrant at night could spend many hours looking around.,,
,,Singapore trip,4,,"Very nice done these 2 domes.A lot lf flowers nice arranged. Shown as different areas as Europe, Australia, Africa,....the rainforest dome is even nicer as the flower dome with its high rainfall and different exhibitions. The lightshow in the evening is really a highlight which is worth to see.",,
,,Absolutely worth it,5,,I learned so much about ecology. It was beautiful. If you have tie a definite must see. Nice place to casually stroll around.,,
,,Very unique,5,,..you can spend there the entire day if you have a time...I took self driving shuttle from Marina Bay Sands (metro station) to the Gardens...definitely go up on sky walk and buy 15 min. guided tour on cart around the Gardens by the Bay (walking takes the whole day as it is huge )...then cool off in Flower Dome and Cloud Forest...of course do not miss light show at 8 p. m. .AMAZING !,,
,,Simply amazing,5,,Words can鈥檛 adequately describe this place. Beautiful. Looks impressive as you drive towards it and your are even more impressed once you鈥檙e inside. Definitely a must do when in Singapore,,
,,Well worth every penny,5,,"Nice collection, very well presented and arranged. Very pleasant cool environment a shelter from the humid heat outside.",,
,,A Must See!,5,,This should be classified as the eighth Wonder of the World. You cannot help but be impressed by these magnificent manmade trees and vast gardens. Visit in the evening around 7.30 pm and listen to the light show set to classical sound tracks. It will take your breath away.,,
,,A highlight of Singapore.,5,,"If you enjoy looking at plants, this is a highlight of Singapore. the two glass houses are worth the ticket price and the super tress are very impressive.",,
,,part of Heaven,5,,"This is a nice picture of GARDENS BY THE BAY and There are two giant conservatory inside this garden which have two different climate and plants but similar architecture. ""Cloud Forest"" and ""Flower Dome"". The Cloud Forest is a cool-moist conservatory and it features a 35-meter tall mountain covered in lush vegetation and the world's tallest indoor waterfall showcases, where visitors can view rare and hidden floral gems found only in tropical highlands up to 2,000-meters above sea level.

The Flower Dome is a 'cool-dry' conservatory located within this beautiful garden. Visitors can view plants from the Mediterranean and semi-arid subtropical regions in a simulated spring climate, where unique plants bloom in an ever-changing display of flowers.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"Excellent experience. Beautiful display, modern approach. Rather crowded but enough space and room to enjoy the flowers and plants. Good shop. Highly recommended to visit, suitable for everyone.",,
,,Stunning,5,,"What a stunning place this is. The beauty, colour, variety, fragrance & experience are all just amazing. We spent over half a day here & could鈥檝e spent the whole day & still been amazed.
The skywalk takes you to another level - literally I hate heights, but the views are worth the stress of the height.
The grounds & facilities are all immaculate.
This is a must see for any traveler- 10/10....",,
,,Must See,5,,Such a soothing experience - the trees light up to different songs. Recommend spraying yourself with mosquito spray beforehand and giving the nearby restaurants a miss - very overpriced and not worth it.,,
,,The most Amazing Park.,5,,"This is like visiting a fantasy land, with the magnificent glass domes, the Super Trees with their walkway high amongst the branches, the magnificent views, all in all, spectacular!",,
,,Out of this world,5,,A visual feast whether you are a garden nut or not. Gardens by the bay should not be missed. We spent 4 hours here and could have stayed longer but schedule did not permit.,,
,,A Must Visit,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is amazing! I purchased my tickets before we arrived from Klook at a discount, I didn't purchase the Tree Skyway one b/c I wasn't sure on the time, but we were able to purchase those tickets an hour before we went up. We spent all day here, it was so cool. The cloud forest and the flower domes are beautiful. We walked around the whole area too. We watched the light show at night under the Tree Skyway, it was really neat.",,
,,Must Visit..,5,,Very innovatively conceived horticulture concepts with masterly crafted gardens and well maintained despite so many foot falls.,,
,,A delight for all the senses. Spend time relaxing here.,5,,"Visit Gardens by the Bay, but make sure you go into the two domes. You will have to pay for this but it is worth every penny, especially the Cloud Dome. One loses all sense of time as one wanders around and up to the top of the waterfall, admiring all the plants and especially the wonderful orchids. On a hot day (and there are many of those in Singapore) this place is an oasis of cool and calm. And dont forget to walk amongst the trees for the very best views too.",,
,,Climate controlled wonderland,4,,"This is best enjoyed in the afternoon, as you're trying to escape the heat and humidity. The domes are nice and cool, and the flora on display is beautiful.",,
,,Fab Fab Fab,5,,Just go! The gardens are pretty and interesting to read about the self sustaining properties. Make sure you do the Cloud Forest at misting time.,,
,,WOW this is a must see attraction in Singapore,5,,2 domes and each worth a visit on their own merits. One houses the waterfall and the other flowers. Both highly recommended and the satay by the gardens food centre is close by.,,
,,Evening walk with the family,5,,"Very nice place, extremely beautiful with outrageous constructions for the plants to climb and super light effects that's making a nice scenery for photos and beautiful memories!",,
,,Amazing!,5,,"Cloud Forest was better than Flower Dome, but both are excellent to visit for an hour or two...reasonably priced at S$28. Highlight is the Supertrees light & music now, shown twice nightly and it鈥檚 free- just go early for a good seat!",,
,,Great,5,,Fantastic - beautiful gardens and a great respite from the heat. Immaculately maintained and very worthwhile,,
,,Beautiful,5,,Beautiful place to visit in Singapore. The domes are a must visit and the surrounding gardens are such a pleasant walk. Ensure you have 3-4 hours to properly enjoy the areas. The light show in the evening is a must do.,,
,,Amazing,5,,Worth the visit in Singapore the garden is very beautiful very impressed by the structure and the view extraordinary for our first visit in Singapore with the family,,
,,Amazing garden,5,,"It is a beautiful garden in the centre of Singapore with outdoor garden & two Domes. The garden is free but domes & tree house need tickets. The flower dome inside very cool, full of different country segments of varieties of plants & flower. There is a restaurant inside & gift shop, the display was beautiful. The Cloud Dome inside is breathtaking with huge waterfall, flowers & plants in the centre, makes a great view. The lift takes you up, than walking down spiral path was a treat to the eyes. The video explaining about planet.

We took a guided tour ride around outside garden. It is a massive garden with different country themes & their plants & flower, also plenty of staff for enquiry & help available. It was an amazing sight at night time, when music & light show start, not to be missed.",,
,,"Amazing Place, Just Amazingl!",5,,I鈥檓 a bloke and not a gardener by any means and my protest flag went straight up when the good wife said 鈥渓et鈥檚 go and check out the gardens鈥?I thought Aye? What? Where? Then I remembered my wedding vowels - the for better or worse bit and thought - how bad good it be? So off I toddled holding hands even and once there Crikey mate! What an amazing place! We stayed till sundown and got to see a fantastic light show - all for free! Then for not much money we got to go inside one of the domey shaped buildings and walk along these really walkways high up in the canopy area Enough said - you just gotta get yourself there and check it out. You won鈥檛 be disappointed I can tell you. Although I鈥檓 still not going to be a gardener I think I did good by accompanying the wife...,,
,,Not to be missed!,5,,Gardens By The Bay is an amazing place. The Cloud Forest and Flower Dome are stunning. The scultures and flowers are beautiful. The Giant Trees light show in the evening is fantastic. We spent hours walking around.,,
,,Simply Beautiful,5,,"What a perfect way to spend our first morning in Simgapore!
Just a short walk from our Hotel....Marina Bay Sands...these gardens are breathtakingly beautiful!
The first dome took us on a spectacular Cloud Walk...time this properly and they ""mist"" it every few hours to produce a proper rainforest cloud effect!
The second Dome contains sample gardens from across the world...from impressive Cactii to stunning Orchids ... all you can imagine, and more!
Not to be missed",,
,,Exquisite,5,,"Wow! We were lucky enough to visit the Garden by the Bay in the evening and so saw the spectacular sound and light show. But before we get to that bit, I must tell you of the domes.
These gardens are a wonder. The two domes - two different climates - are amazing. The drier one, the Mediterranean, had a cherry blossom display when we were there. The Japanese influence was beautiful and restful.
The second other dome contains a man made waterfall and wet climate plants. You need to be prepared for a walk to the top. It is well worth it.
The skywalk is not be be missed either and, lucky for us, we didn't have to wait long in the queue. The view towards the Marina Bay Hotel, with its spectacular pool on the roof, if fantastic!
The gardens are big, so take your time and allow enough time to see them in their entirety.
As dusk fell (quickly, it is the tropics after all) the sound and light show commenced. Get a position early, and be prepared for a feast for ears and eyes. It was truly wonderful for all ages.",,
,,Spectacular at Night,4,,"A good idea to come at night and see the spectacular light show. The gardens are beautiful, many varieties of plants and lush green lawns. Lots to see then head over the Marina for a bite or gamble.",,
,,Beautiful attraction,5,,Absolutely out of this world to everyone even more so if you're a plant lover like me.You must not miss visiting here even if you're in Singapore for a short while.,,
,,Gardens,5,,"Situated right behind the marina bay sands hotel this garden is beautiful, with stunning statues and ponds . The walkway gave an excellent view .",,
,,Nice Experience,5,,"I visited there with my wife when we visited there for our Honeymoon. She enjoyed it a lot. We spent around 3 hours there and covered the whole area. It is so nice to see the light show at night, we could be able to cover up that by the hotel that we stayed nearby. A must visit in Singapore.",,
,,Annual visit to check out the changes,5,,We love Gardens by the Bay - the plants are always changing; the various ecosystems seem to be updated on a yearly basis.,,
,,Must see attraction,5,,So many things to see at gardens by the bay. Worth the ticket price to go into the two domes. Make sure you return at night to see the structures lit up. Returned in following days to just wander around the free areas of the park. Easy to get to by MRT. Awesome displays wherever you look.,,
,,Nothing like it anywhere in the world!,5,,"A must see in Singapore! Cloud forest is amazing, flower dome was ok, but coming from cold climate it wasnt anything too interesting to me. Super tree grove is out of this world. think Avatar. The light shows are great.

The only reccommendation i would say is if you want to do the Super Tree Grove skyway, you need to book a couple of hours in advance of when u want to go up there. Especially dusk/night time. Tickets are timed for 20min period and limited availability. I went there at 7:10pm and couldnt get access til 9:20pm. You can only buy tickets/choose allocated time when you get there on the day. Go straight to booking your time slot, then go and enjoy cloud forest and flower dome.",,
,,Singapore 2017,5,,Place is exceptional and rate as on eof the best tourist attractions in Singapore. Location is one of the best creations in the world.,,
,,Even better than photos suggest,5,,"We arrived early on a weekday and spent over 4 hours wandering around. The Cloud Forest must be on my top 10 of incredible man-made structures around the world - so much attention to details. The OCDC Skyway gives a great view of the gardens too and worth the cost. There is a lovely splash park for the kids (bring bathers) and Satay by the Bay had delicious satays (a plate of 12 mixed satay with rice was about SG $15. We came back at night to see the free light show which was a little cheesy, but very enjoyable.",,
,,Great place,5,,"You must go, every part of it is amazing and it鈥檚 crazy all the nature and the architecture placed together.",,
,,beautiful,5,,"absolutely amazing place, saw it at night and it was wonderful. one of my favourite sights. defo recommend",,
,,Nice but too cold and crowded for comfort,3,,"We visited again after a gap of 3 years. This time we saw additional varieties. But we were not prepared forthe chill inside (which is artificially maintained). So if you are taking your kids, ensure you carry warm clothes for them. The crowd also was too much and we could not enjoy it much. (We went on a Saturday).",,
,,"Floral Fantasy , the latest attraction",5,,"Floral Fantasy is The latest attraction at Garden bynthe bay , is a small garden with beautiful flowers , with 4D movie about garden by the bay. ticket is $9 , inclusive 4D movie and you need to book the time to enter the venue",,
,,Must Visit for first Timers Especially for Kids,5,,"This Incredible Man made garden is a must visit place in Singapore located next to the Iconic Marina Bay Sands and easily accessible by the MRT. We were lucky to be visiting during the Chinese New Year and got to see some excellent performances the kids loved the Dragon Dance shows which were free. There is no entrance fee and you can see most of the Park divided into different gardens and themes plus there are wonderful play areas for kids which are also free. If you want to go into the Cloud Forest, Flower Dome or On top of the Supertree Groves then you have to get tickets but the rest you can enjoy for free. The place is beautiful so clean and very well managed at night the SuperTree Groves light up making for some amazing selfies they also have light and music shows at the SuperTree Groves. We had an amazing time and the kids loved the free sand play areas and especially the Water Play area which was very good.",,
,,Wonderful gardens!!!,5,,Don鈥檛 miss going to Forest Cloud and the Flower area!! There鈥檚 a pay shuttle that operates but if you鈥檙e willing to walk (so hot though!) then the views are great.,,
,,Perfect for plant experts and nature lovers!,5,,"Gardens host a large variety of flowers and plants, as well as a giant indoor waterfall that somewhat cools the area around as one can slowly scale to the submit of the waterfall ""hill"".... definitely recommend for a pleasure walk.",,
,,Excellent garden,5,,This garden is too big and one can spend almost entire day exploring different types of flowers/shrubs here. They have flower dome and cloud forst. This is a must visit garden,,
,,Tiptoe through the tulips 馃榾,5,,"This place is amazing. There are two separate buildings and both are impressive. The Floral Gardens have a Tulip Theme and a very cool garden to walk through. The Cloud Forest has a 7 story waterfall and loads of Instagram worthy shots. Very much worth the time and cost, bring comfortable walking shoes.",,
,,Most impressive and enjoyable,5,,"All the exhibits are extremely well laid out, the domes are amazing. The cloud forest dome is absolutely amazing and a must for any trip to Singapore. Easy access to MRT station. Try to visit outside of school holidays",,
,,Best attraction in Singapore,5,,At night the must see is the rhapsody music and light show. Absolutely breathtaking and thrilling. During the day the different themed gardens are awe inspiring. The Cloud Forest and Flowers in Bloom were absolutely wonderful. A cool experience inside away from the humidity outside.,,
,,Flower fantasy,5,,"Luved the 4d show. A highlight of our beautiful city. All is very systematic and clean. Luved the service and staff were kind. Luved the flowers, concept and the show.

Just 1 negative... there arepriority queues but older folks are generally ignored. I had a pioneer citizen with me who had to stand in queue and move without much care",,
,,Best place to visit in Singapore,5,,One of the best modern day constructed marvel in Singapore . Must visit if with family and kids . Light show every evening is awesome and worth the wait . OCBC skyway must as well,,
,,Best views if Singapore,5,,"Sought this attraction out and was not disappointed, views were excellent and the greenery really soothing, proximity to the free children's garden and water features also a huge bonus for families.",,
,,Excellent!,5,,Must visit at least one time. Location is very nice and easy to go by MRT. You just drop at marina bay station and there are many places around for your visiting.,,
,,"Stunning Gardens, a must see in Singapore",5,,"These stunning glass conservatories are a must see when in Singapore, and they're fully air conditioned! The Cloud Forest has a magnificent 40 metre high waterfall inside it, and all the plant life mimics what you might find in a real rainforest. The Flower Dome is more curated type gardens, but equally as beautiful. Unfortunately we did not get to do the Skywalk due to the threat of thunderstorms so I recommend you do this first and visit the conservatories afterwards, as these can be seen in any weather.",,
,,Best ever man made thing !!,5,,Gardens by the bay is the best thing that man has made. This garden is just out of the world. Kudos to the imagination of all those involved in creating this genius. It takes more than 3 hours for one to just check out the entire place but is worth each and every minute. This is a marvel. A walk around this serene and beautiful place is one of the 'the' things that a visitor should do while in Singapore. Its worth each penny and dollar you spend.,,
,,Great Experience,5,,"I would recommend visiting the Cloud Forest and the Flower Domes they are worth visiting in their own right but also offer some respite for when it's hot and humid outside. I scheduled our visit for late afternoon to ensure we weren't too tired to enjoy the Garden Rhapsody light show, which was well worth waiting for. I think you need to be a garden lover to get the most out of your visit, that said i really enjoyed my time there and would certainly do it again.",,
,,V. Nice,5,,Flower dome absolutely wonderful! Cloud forest was just ok but you get combined tickets for both. It took us one hour in each dome unlike the reviews that ask you to keep aside 2 hrs each. So we were left with lot of time between watching garden Rhapsody and exiting from the domes. And that day there were some showers during the day and the Rhapsody also malfunctioned and whole evening got wasted.,,
,,Highlight of Singapore!,5,,"Ok so if you are visiting Singapore and you don;t have time to see a lot of things, this is the place to go. It's truly amazing!",,
,,Gardens by the Bay,1,,Don鈥檛 waste your time or money. A bunch of plants trees and bushes with hundreds of Asians taking phone pics EVERYWHERE. Lots of kids running around. $28 pp for a short Tramride after waiting in a line. Most plants aren鈥檛 identified; one set up for pics is non-life size plastic truck filled with tulips. Of course you exit through the elaborate gift shop on your way out. The Tram does NOT drive you through the 鈥渆lectric鈥?lighted metal 鈥渢rees鈥? You can walk through that too. All 250 acres of it in 90 deg humid heat. Have fun!,,
,,Beautiful garden rhapsody light show,5,,We visited gardens by the bay both in the daytime and in the evening. In the daylight you can see all the beautiful flowers in the garden but I would totally recommend visiting this place in the evening when the super trees are lighted. There are a sound and light show two times a day (7.45pm and 8.45pm). The show is really beautiful and it feels like you are in a fairytale while watching the lights in the trees dance to the music. Take you camera with you because you will be able to take amazing photos here!,,
,,Beautiful gardens and Skyway,5,,Spent Sunday afternoon at the Gardens by the Bay. Toured the Cloud Forest and Flower Garden Conservatories and did the Skywalk. Wonderful place! Can鈥檛 recommend it highly enough. Definitely do the Skywalk! Had to wait a bit as it closes when there is absolutely any chance of lightening but it was well worth it!,,
,,Worth going to,5,,You need a whole day to go to see the gardens by the bay & to stay at night for the light show. You really need good comfortable shoes for this day out as there is a lot of walking.,,
,,The free attractions are well worth a visit,4,,"Spent 3hrs here early 1 morning whilst it was quiet, just walking around the gardens, which were very nice. I didn't pay to enter the main displays, but very happy with what I saw",,
,,Must see,5,,This place is so interesting that you must go here and spend at least half a day but probably more especially if you want to see the night light show also. So much to walk around and see on the outside of the domes and then a whole lot more in the domes plus the Sky Walk. Not just for garden lovers but for everyone with so much to see.,,
,,Amazing Light Show,4,,"Went here for the evening light show. LCDs and neon light spectacular made all the better by being fully dosed on LSD. Dropping a star because one of our friends got searched on the way out and due to repressive drug laws got sentenced to death. Fortunately they were so high they thought the military personnel shooting them were the Ghostbusters so went out happy with the last words of the famous Ray Parker Jnr ""I ain't afraid of no ghost"".",,
,,At night nothing special,4,,"Light and sound show at 9pm. It's so so... Please come here during day time, better to take a photo with natural light",,
,,10am,4,,Great outing with the kids and families from overseas! The Children playground especially the water play area was an excellent space to keep the kids occupied and happy!,,
,,A must see in Singapore,5,,You can't come to Singapore without spending time wandering around the fabulous gardens; and don't miss the spectacular evening light show.,,
,,Incredible man made indoor garden in giant structures,4,,"Great experience if you need to get away from heaty weather, try to visit Garden by the Bay. Thousand of plant species you will able to find here. A giant water fall to take your breath away too!",,
,,Amazing,4,,"A visit to the Gardens by the bay is a must for every visitor to Singapore. I would have given this attraction 5 stars but the flower dome was a bit disappointing. The main dome,gardens and sky walk were spectacular and educational too.",,
,,"Outstanding, a must see if your visiting Singapore",5,,"We spent our first full day visiting these gardens with 3 attractions in the same place, returning in the evening for the Gardens by the bay light show.

Firstly the extensive gardens themselves including Supergrove structures. Free entry, close to the MRT, stunning gardens, birdlife , fountains and water displays and an impressive array of sculptures.

Next the ""Flower Dome"" Entry fee applies. An enormous air cooled dome that at the time we visited had ranges of flowers, plants and amazing trees from all around the world separated into their regions. A special highlight at the time was the Flowering cheery blossoms from Japan including a Japanese cultural display and market. Another great feature were the incredible wooden sculptures interwoven with the plants and trees. Must see.

Next the ""Cloud forest"" an enormous construction within an air cooled dome that incorporates a full sized waterfall. You catch a lift to the top of the structure a wind your way down several times to the bottom on platforms. Wooden sculptures are also include in this eye catching display. Entry fee applies.

Finally you must return in the evening to catch the Gardens by the Bay light display that incorporates the the Supergrove structures in the gardens. A world class light display twice every evening which is a photographers delight.

An unforgettable day.

,,Never miss the visit to the lovely domes,5,,"I鈥檝e always enjoyed the visit to the two domes. Love the beautifully decorated Flower Dome and the natural ambience of the Cloud Dome with the stunning high waterfall which welcome everyone upon entrance. The amazing displays always change, thus each time when I visit there鈥檚 something new. And it鈥檚 always spectacular !!!! A good place to beat the heat but don鈥檛 forget to bring a jacket/cardigan as it can be super cold.",,
,,Plenty of scenery to capture,5,,Astounding collection of natural plants and fabulous architecture keeps one or two full days attached to both the parks in Gardens by the Bay. Night visit addition to morning one is a must. Recommended to buy two time or three time pass to visit.,,
,,Flowers,5,,"Beautiful, clean, pretty, easy to find way there. Can spend half a day. If evening can have dinner at the Majestic restaurant",,
,,Water Play,4,,There a nice water play park in the compound. The kids love it running around with their friends on a hot morning. Nice place for them to cool down. Haha.,,

,,"This is a must visit, if you are on a trip to Singapore",5,,One of the most beautiful tourist places in Singapore. The flower dome and rainforest are a magnificent example of what an island country can make despite of less natural resources. It鈥檚 truly beautiful. Suggestion - it鈥檚 supercool inside take a jacket or cardigan along with.,,
,,Breakfast,5,,It was my first visit as a local. Unexpectedly stunning view. Lovely set up with beautifully manicured garden. Was surprised how beautiful it is and definitely worth visit again.,,
,,Don't miss this attraction,5,,"Do yourself a favour and make the time to visit this stunning attraction. Changing all the time, the displays are amazing. Look for the hidden wood and brass sculptures all through the gardens. A great place to beat the Singapore heat.",,
,,Garden by the bay,5,,Beautiful garden and amazing the rain tree forest. Location is so convenient right next to the MRT. One of the best garden in the world,,
,,Gardens by the Bay - Number 1 Sg attraction,5,,"Gardens by the Bay (GBTB) is a must visit for all tourists and is handsdown Singapore's number one attraction.
I would recommend the itinerary below for tourists trying to get the essence of Singapore in less than 3 days.
First : Buy all tickets online and wear comfortable casual clothes and don't forget that selfie stick.
4-5pm - Singapore Flyer (I would recommend it for a complete experience of Singapore, but can choose to skip this)
15 min walk from Flyer to Gardens by the bay (lovely views)
5:30 - 8pm : GBTB (Flower dome, Cloud Forest and Super Tree Grove)
Get hold of a map, as this place is massive and you don't want to go in circles.
Take a stroll in the free gardens first eg.Chinese Garden, meadow before u step into both the Glass domes for which you need ur tickets. The Sky bridge also requires a ticket.
Cloud Forest - the tall dome with a Spidery waterfall and a rainforesty picture - few hollywood movies shot here.
Flower dome : Beautiful Orchids and regional flowers.Dont miss
7:45 - don't miss the musical show at the Super Tree Grove
8-9:30pm : Dinner at either Indochine (Supertree Grove) expensive or at any of the restaurants in Marina Bay Sands (MBS)
10 min walk from Gardens by the Bay to Marina Bay Sands
9:45 till as much time as u can afford : Marina Bay Sands
Will review MBS separately (quick highlights - Rooftop bar CeLavi for the views, Casino - a rich yet free experience and multiple luxury shopping options).
It's a shame if you are visiting Singapore and fly out without visiting GBTB and MBS. Happy Travelling...",,
,,Must do,5,,"I have been to Gardens by The Bay 3 times.
It is absolutely worth going to. Make sure you go into the flower dome and the cloud dome. Also do the Skywalk. It's fabulous.
I will go there every time I visit Singapore as they do keep changing things.
Best time to go is about 4pm when it's starting to get cooler. Make sure you stay for the light show.
You won't be disappointed",,
,,Gardens from heaven.,5,,"Give yourself a couple hrs before sunset to enjoy the gardens as well as a decent spot to enjoy the light show 30 min after sunset. It was incredible to see ! Bring water in a pack and after, take photos walking back over the bridge towards Marina Bay MRT. You won鈥檛 be disappointed, spent 10 days for our honeymoon. Magnificent place to see.",,
,,Nice cool Garden,3,,"Try to time your visit when there are theme exhibits, otherwise will be normal garden with air-conditioning. The waterfall is tall but really not much special. The treetop walk is worth a trip.",,
,,Mrs,5,,The lights and Music show by night is a must see. We live in Singapore we like to visit Gardens by the Bay by night from time to time and every time we are enchanted by it,,
,,Amazing Attraction,5,,"Visited Flower Dome and Cloud Forest, its really eye opening and educational (plants). Tips: Temperature inside dome is cooling, do bring jacket. The evening light show was impressive too. Unfortunately, we were unable to experience the OCBC skyway due to weather (thunders).",,
,,walk the canopy,4,,found a bistro in the sky garden to chill out and enjoy the bay view of Singapore. Get to see Marina bay with a pint or two delicious draft,,
,,Beautiful Flowers,5,,i went there for the sakura matsuri event. beautiful flowers indoors with air condition makes the walk comfortable.,,
,,Gardens by the Bay Fantastic,5,,"We travelled to Garden by the Bay on the MRT getting off at Bayfront Station, walked through the underpass straight into the Gardens, could not be easier. (allow 4-5 hours walking to see everything) As we knew the Domes and Supertree grove would take up a lot of time we decided to walk around the gardens first, following the watercourse around (anti-clockwise) this leads to the Supertree Grove eventually. The Supertrees Grove structures are fantastic as was the OCBC walkway (great photo opportunities. The onto the Domes, these cannot be missed it is worth spending the money to go inside the domes. Then finish you walk looking at the amazing gardens. If in Singapore this attraction is not to be missed.",,
,,A piece of living art,5,,"An amazing experience seeing the Cloud Forest and Flower Domes. Each one air conditioned and an artwork, traversing the pathways and different plants and flowers was stunning. The illuminated trees and light show in the evening are a great spectacle and not to be missed. As the area of the gardens is so vast you should wait till around 3 or 4 in the afternoon before starting your experience and then snack before seeing the light show at 8pm. The walkway experience is ok but not really worth the money in my view.",,
,,Flowers,5,,"The Gardens by the Bay is one place I love to visit, especially the Flowers Dome.

The dome has a wide variety of beautiful flowers n plants on display. The cool temperature inside the dome makes it a delight to wander among the flowers and enjoy the beautiful sights.",,
,,Heaven on earth,5,,"Visited cloud forest, the most from waterfall was exhilarating.
The plants and flowers from all over the world are growing in controlled environment radiating effect of calming, happiness and enjoyment.

Another interesting place is Flower dome, where you see a variety of beautiful flowers.

There are nice food outlets and place to walkabout.

Anyone visiting Singapore must visit Gardens by the bay",,

To me the highlight was the supertree grove light show where the trees come to life with colourful lights and some music it was a really good day out. Unfortunately the cloud Forest had maintenance work so we could not visit but we did go inside the flower Dome which was full of every type of client you could imagine with wonderful displays.,,
,,Absolutely a must to visit,5,,"Magical. Recommended to visit it during the day. It would require 5 or 6 hours to see the flower dome and cloud dome. Including lunch or coffee breaks.
For family with children, it would be good to bring swimsuits for the kids as they have an amazing section for water games after finishing the tour..
Supertree visit is fantastic, try to do it late afternoon especially in the hot days.. don't skip it though!",,

,,If flowers and plants are your type of things,3,,It was the Sakura season hence the flower dome was filled with flowers from Japan and there were lots of Japanese style decorations. Worth going if there are special exhibitions like this.,,
,,The most beautiful place to see flowers and plants in abundance.,5,,"We visited here during a 3 day stopover in Singapore. Wow , absolutely loved it, definitely one not to miss. We spent about 3 hours wandering around the two huge domes full of masses of colourful flowers, plants and trees. The waterfall in one dome was brilliant, well done to all those who have created such stunning displays and continue to maintain them.",,
,,Different and for sure worth a visit!,4,,"I have been there twice and will for sure go there a third time! I am not especially interested in botanical issues, but Garden by the Sea fascinated me! Go there and experience it - not just watch, but even feel!! Best regards Egil",,
,,Always a pleasure,5,,"It never gets boring, full of life and vibrant. We鈥檝e taken visitors there since it opened and visit at least 6 times a year, yet each time there is something new and interesting going on. The light show is always enchanting and the F&B outlets are a great place for a little tea break.",,
,,An Amazing Experience,4,,It is a magical place that everyone should visit. The care of this garden is just amazing and the light show at night is just stuning and everyone should see it at least once.,,
,,Excellent and unique experience,4,,We visited for around 3 hours taking in Flower Dome and Cloud Forest package. Highlight of Flower Dome is Tulip display. We spent more time and enjoyed much more Cloud Forest. Caught the 20:45 music and light show at Supertree Grove. Not to be missed,,

,,Cool garden experience in warm Singapore,4,,Beautiful plants and enjoy a nice stroll in an air-conditioned environment! Many photo opportunities along the way and do look our for the waterfall! Parking can be challenging and put on your good walking shoes as parking area is a long way from the domes,,
,,Mesmerizing!!,5,,Amazing collection of flowers in flower dome.. cloud forest is most amazing manmade forest I have ever seen.. every step is filled with something new to enjoy.. don't miss Light & sound show at Super Grove trees.. 19:40 & 20:40 two shows every day.. Tip: grab seat well in advance for show..,,
,,Magnificent must do,5,,What a great experience both daytime and nighttime. The grounds are kept immaculate and free of charge. The 2 conservatories were an extra fee but kept cool so a great way to cool off from a hot humid day. And the light show on the metal trees was set to music and fabulous twice a night. Walk around the garden both day and night. (Kids water park too) A must do while in Singapore. A great view of the garden from atop the Marina Bay Sands too.,,
,,Refreshing,4,,"It's my favorite place in the country. Whenever i have time the afternoon, I would always go there for a walk.",,
,,"A ""Must Visit"" attraction",5,,Plan on spending at least one whole day here. Don't miss The Cloud Mist and Flower Domes. The nightly light shows are a must see event.,,
,,Mind blowing!!!,5,,"The light show is free and is so worth the trip. What a spectacular show, wished I was there longer because I would have gone every night. Everyone watching was in awe.",,
,,Most innovative and beautiful,5,,I love the concept of Gardens By The Bay. There are 2 domes - Flower Dome and Cloud Dome. Both are great and beautiful but my favorite is the Cloud Dome. With a 7 story high waterfall and the various levels with different landscapes. Very enjoyable and highly recommend place to visit.,,
,,Simply Fascinating,5,,"You will never be disappointed going to the Gardens By The Bay! Enter the two domes in the day time and you won't feel the heat of the City but you will be in awe admiring the flowers or the different gardens. In the evening you will enjoy the glittering lights of the super trees. I guarantee that you will be taking tens if not hundreds of pictures.
If you are like me yearning for food, then you will be delighted with the variety of local and international dishes. If you are a tourist coming to Singapore, Gardens By The Bay is one place that you simply can't miss.",,
,,one of the best gardens in the world,5,,A place not to miss for anyone who loves nature. It took about 4 hours to cover the complete area and we went back for the night light show. Great plantings from all over the world and the gardens are very organized just like all of Singapore!!,,
,,High life; Great Fun,5,,"Marina Bay Sands is an amazing entertainment Cum cultural location for any discerning visitors. Hyge mix if high end , interesting shops that are accessible, affordable & gives great experience both for shopping, dining, personal care & cultural immersion. The England offers superb view of the city plus breathtaking plunge pool experience
Of course there's the Casino which I did not visit

MBS is also within walking distance to the Marina Bay Gardens whuch is out of this world
MBS is cerrainly Well worth many visits",,
,,Stopover stay,5,,Absolutely beautiful. The landscaping was immaculate. Easy walking wheelchair friendly and plenty of places to stop and sit. Spoiled for choices of scenery.,,
,,Wow,5,,"Heaven on earth. Beautiful crafted plants, trees and flowers from all across the world in a controlled environment . Artificial fall starts the journey and gives a feel of real falls. A great tour to cloud dome and then to flower dome really keep you smiling.
Not to miss the wonderful light show which is mesmerising",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"Awesome place, thousands of plants and gorgeous waterfalls. A must see when visiting Singapore. Good views from the top of the walkway and the light show at night is fantastic.",,
,,Just amazing!,5,,"The main reason for our visit to Singapore and did not disappoint! Well worth the cost of the visit - a large proportion is free to walk round and then you pay for the domes and the tree walk. The whole thing is amazing - not much more to say!

The light show in the evening is worth making sure you are there for. There are two shows, 19:45 & 20:45. We went to the 19:45 show as we were already there. It is always going to be the busiest one as people time their visits to finish at that point (at a guess). Hint - the display is in the Super Tree Grove and you need to be able to at least see some of all of the three biggest trees as they work together to create the display. We wondered down at the start time and sat on the floor as people start to congregate very early to wait for the start. If you need a seat and want to be able to see everything then head down around 30m beforehand. We were happy to stand/sit on the floor.

If in Singapore do it! You won't regret it!",,
,,Don鈥檛 miss the light show,5,,"They have a light show at the Gardens by the Bay every night at 7:45 and repeats at 8:45. Don鈥檛 miss it. Find a good spot under one of the huge tree like structures.

The gardens themselves are well designed and represent different countries in the world. They are well laid out.

You can get here by subway, train or walk.

Take the time to enjoy",,
,,SIN Trip,4,,Not really my thing but thought I would have a look. The indoor rainforest looked spectacular from the outside but I couldn鈥檛 justify SGD57.00 to see it up close and personal. Outside is free and would easily a day to see it all. Lots of food options,,
,,Must visit,4,,This is one of the must visit places in Singapore. Beautifully maintained. The Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are unique. Gives you a feeling of practically being there in a rain forest. Do visit. The Super Trees which light up at night is an absolute pleasure to watch. Do for this beautiful garden.,,
,,Fantastic and FREE place to visit!!,4,,There are entry fees to sealed botanical gardens but the remainder of this large park is free to stroll and enjoy! Very enjoyable afternoon there!,,
,,Enjoyable day out,5,,"We enjoyed an afternoon at Gardens by the Bay, particularly the Cloud Forest which was lovely. Entry cost us $25.20 each upon showing our Singapore airlines boarding pass. We also went back in the evening to watch the free light show which was great.",,
,,Beautiful view and well maintained - highly recommended,5,,"The Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are pretty spectacular (and air conditioned!). We walked around the Gardens and the took numerous pictures, my only regret is we didn't go at night for the light show, though we did see it from farther off the previous night. Get the Klook app for discounted tickets (and skip the ticket line).",,
,,Beautiful manmade garden,5,,Garden by the bay is a beautiful manmade garden. A must visit. Spend at least 2-3 hours at this attraction. Pre book tickets to avoid getting stuck at long queues,,
,,domed gardens,5,,"excellent tour of both domes, fabulous experience, highly recommended, add to your list. Different zones and good facilities.",,
,,Beautiful light show,5,,"If you have the chance to get down here I would strongly recommend it. We managed to time it by complete fluke to be there for the light show which is night at 7.45 and 8.45 which was so worth it. If you get there early enough you can pay to walk up on the walkway but the line is long. We opted not to wait and watched the show under the trees with many others. It was beautiful.
Easy to get to via the mrt",,
,,Great Singapore experience,5,,Visited this during the day and then again at night. Singapore has embraced the concept of growing trees in any spare space available. Both gardens by the bay and the flower dome are amazing man made structures that celebrate vegetation from around the world. Definitely worth a visit whilst in Singapore.,,
,,A MUST!,5,,Very impressive set up/garden. Both greenhouses exhibit a great variety of plants. Light & music show at 7:45 and 8:44 worth waiting for. It was more impressive though watching it from the ground than from the skywalk. The whole set up enables also a great view on Marina Bay Sands. We only had problems with the orientation as the signs were really not well placed.,,
,,A must see,4,,"We went to The Gardens at about midday so that there would not be too many visitors. The structures and the diverse plant life are very impressive. The only downside is the cost, 28$ a head strikes me as a little steep.",,
,,Most gorgeous attraction ever seen,5,,"We were able to visit the light show in the evening (don't miss it) and then returned the next day for a tour of both the Flower Dome & Cloud Mountain. They are the most amazing ""greenhouses"" we have ever seen in all our days of traveling. I would say this is a DO NOT MISS attraction.",,
,,A must see in Singapore!,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is a must see in Singapore! Beautiful landscaping, architecture and a phenomenal lights show at 7:45 pm each evening.

Arrive early (say 7:30 pm) and find a spot to sit. We ended up sitting on the pavement which was clean enough and had a great view of the show.",,
,,must visit,5,,excellent must see attraction.. although light show is free cloud forest and garden displays must be seen....there are two shows an hour apart starting at 7.45pm,,
,,Amazing country.,5,,"Very clean,green everywhere,polite people and everybody very friendly and helpful.Amazing and extremely modern architecture can be seen everywhere.Little Indie is spoiling my view of Singapore.Smell,rubbish and waste everywhere,burning waste next to children playground,people unfriendly and ignorant to do business.",,
,,Gardens by the bay is heavenly,5,,Gardens by the bay is star attraction and enjoyed by masses. Cost about 30 singapore dollars. Evening time is best. There are several photo opportunities. Must go up till the top. Evening show with dancing lights and sounds is around 745 and 8.30 which should not be missed. Highly recommended.,,
,,Visit to gardens by bay,4,,Garden of bay is located at prime location of Singapore and one of the premium place to singapore.nice view,,
,,Amazing,5,,"An incredible experience, the cloud dome particularly. Light show at 7.45 not to be missed. Beautiful gardens very well maintained",,
,,Spectacular,5,,Beautiful gardens with an amazing light show every night. Recommend you pay the extra to visit the domes.,,
,,New flowers every season,5,,It's worth visiting this high tech flower garden every few months. Singapore purchase flowers from all over the world and place them in this place,,
,,Awesome,5,,One of best locations ive been to.. especially at night. So relaxing to see the view here.. worth the time to come and stop by at gardens by the bay..,,
,,Flower Dome worth visiting,5,,2-3 hours well spent in the flower dome. The place is done up with a theme every few months. Don鈥檛 miss it!,,
,,Wow! Money well spent,5,,I made it a mission to see this as my second stop and glad I did. I started with the skywalk I'm the main park and took some great pics - this was for $8. Then walked into the main bit and did the 2 zones- cloud zone by far the best- that waterfall was a real treat. Around $20 I think for both. Then some dim sum by the sea. Great morning experience,,
,,An evening to remember in Singapore,5,,"Attending Singapore for a business meeting, we made the most of a free evening to visit Gardens by the Bay and spend some time at the rooftop bar within the gardens. Stunning views of Singapore and a wonderful way to spend an evening - would highly recommend!",,
,,Beautiful Garden,5,,Was recommended by the hotel to come and take a look. We were amazed that it opens at 5am and closes at 2am. We enjoyed ourselves alot during our visit.,,
,,Whata great amenity,5,,"This is a large open space with a variety of planting plus a couple of (chargeable) enclosed areas. There is a lake, and the famous articial ""trees"" with a light show.
It is completely free other than the 2 ""domes"", and there are some eating areas.
We found it a great way to relax for a few hours, and were amazed to find something of this quality that was mainly free to enter.",,
,,Fantastic place,5,,All I can say is this place is amazing. I took over 100 photos and my husband took almost that many also. I cannot recommend this highly enough. It will take you several hours to see this and you can spend a couple more hours roaming the grounds. If you come to Singapore this is a must see. Many varieties of plants and flowers that we had never seen before.,,
,,Beautiful and very different; good light and audio show in the evening,5,,Definitely worth a visit. We stayed outdoors to view the light up 'trees' as it moved into evening. We hadn't realised the time and managed to catch the lights and music show in the centre. It was a little 'Disney-fied' in some ways but lovely all the same.,,
,,Not to be missed,5,,"Visited on a Sunday afternoon/evening at sunset. Most of the gardens are free which is amazing as they are beautiful and not too crowded. We watched the light show which was so memorable. A beautiful experience, not to be missed. The light show is also free but we paid to go up the super trees after the show had ended. Great views over Singapore. If you鈥檙e looking for low cost but high quality family entertainment then I would highly recommend this attraction.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay at Night,4,,"Really cool area to walk through at night. Unfortunately, we weren鈥檛 there during their light show that goes off at certain times depending on the day. Other than that, very nice and free to walk though!",,
,,wonderful light and sound show,4,,it is a garden with huge man-made trees. The whole garden is lighted in the evening. A sky walk from the top of tree from where you can see the entire Singapore.,,
,,Best sight in Singapore,5,,"The Gardens by the Bay absolutely blew me away. What an asset to Singapore.

We went to the night light show which was amazing and I could easily have gone to watch it again (free at 7.45pm). We wandered around the gardens (it was pretty hot so might be a good idea to catch the shuttles that can take you around (small fee), or even hire a bike.

The domes were cooler in temp so great to escape the heat and were beautifully staged with lush gardens and special features. You could spend hours in there looking at everything and wandering around slowly.

Definitely my number 1 recommendation to visit (even a few times) when in Singapore.

Note: Be careful of buying Domes and Skywalk off Zlook as we were given kids ticket which couldn't be used in the end and I haven't been refunded for. You can get cheap entries at hotels so use them instead.",,
,,Beautiful place,5,,Its huge with something for everyone. Food outlets such as cafe fast food restaurant for varying budget Trail choices such as aircon domes open space gardens lakes,,
,,"Nature,beauty and great Design",5,,A must to visit.10-12 years back there was not much to do.This is a garden and magic of nature combined .Also with inventiveness how we can create something so refreshing.,,
,,Fantastic area in the city,5,,"Walking through these gardens is a must if you鈥檙e in the city. It鈥檚 a totally different perspective and atmosphere between daytime and night, so worth a repeat visit. While it's a fantastic experience to climb to the walkways through the tree tops, it鈥檚 not essential to enjoy the gardens and soak up the lights. With the backdrop of the MBS hotel and the impressive sculptures and artwork it鈥檚 a hive of activity and a brilliant way to pass a couple of hours.",,
,,Sakura in Singapore,5,,"Awesome Sakura flowers blomming in Singapore , nice Japanese theme with many beautiful flowers visited with my 88 years old Mother on wheelchair , very easy to access as is wheelchair friendly",,
,,Absolutely stunning and must-see venue,5,,"We were blown away by the beauty and thought and planning that has gone into these magnificent gardens and structures. You must go and see this is you are visiting Singapore, you will not be disappointed. My husband and I even walked to the gardens from our hotel, and exhausted though I was, I was still absolutely amazed at the gardens.",,
,,Very entertaining and worthwhile.,5,,"Our planned day trip coincided with maintenance on the flower greenhouse. This was our main interest however we were offered a discount for the inconvenience. Apart from the one greenhouse we did everything there was to offer and had a terrific experience. There was so much for our 9 year old daughter to experience first in the water park and kids play gym area. Then a bite to eat at the kids restaurant which was quick, tasty and easy. Onwards to the more adult attractions including the cloud forest. In all a fantastic and thought provoking trip providing a lot of much needed education in climate change and pollution. As a family we spent a whole day there which was a fantastic experience before heading to Raffles for an indulgent cocktail.",,
,,A must see,5,,I wasn鈥檛 sure what to expect but after seeing both exhibits this is a must see. The presentation of the plants is amazing and the amount of different species from around the world in very impressive. The rainforest features a huge waterfall as you enter and then you make your way up through the foliage to the top. My wife and I had a great tour and then stopped at satay by the bay for lunch. Nice way to finish the morning. The night time exhibition is worth going to and watching the changing of the tree colors to music. When in Singapore this has to be on your to see list.,,
,,Totally Worthwhile Even if It's Crowded,5,,"Gorgeous experience--the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest Dome were incredible. So well kept! Every petal in place! The scale of these domes really can't be captured in pictures--they are huge and so impressive. I liked the cloud forest best, mostly for all the intricate wood/animal carvings woven into the lushness of the trees and plants. Really educational, too. I like the conservation messaging and the learning piece, even if the photo ops will steal the spotlight.",,
,,fantastic,5,,"wanted to do the whole thing here , but because of flight delays only had the opportunity to see the gardens during the day , we mainly visited the 2 pods, wow flowers , flowers and flowers , beautiful displays and then to the other pod, unbelievable, just wished we could have visited during the evening when the light show is on",,
,,fantastic visit,5,,what a wonderful visit we had spent a long time walking and viewing in amazement its hard to believe all this is in such a small country,,
,,The most amazing garden that I ever see,5,,"Stunning, unique, beautiful, I could go on and on, u can spend the whole afternoon there and see the night lights show",,
,,marvellous,5,,very nice park to walk in in the afternoon. Great diversity and a lot to see. The work done to build the flower towers amazing,,
,,Fab show,5,,The night show is the best. Tune your cost to the domes starting from 3-4 pm so that you can catch the night show,,
,,Amazing,5,,"Amazing place in daytime, so much to see and must stay to see the evening the light show. Highly recommend.",,
,,Great!,5,,"It is a must see when visiting Singapore! So green, ecofriendly and not crowded! Enjoy the tour and finish it at 7.45pm (or 8.45pm) with the lovely music and light show!",,
,,New gardens beautiful displays. Leave loads of time.,5,,These New gardens are incredible but leave lots of time Min 3 hours to see a good portion of them. Queues can be a pain at certain times. A bit disappointing to have to pay extra for other areas.,,
,,Amazing - a Must see!,5,,Never seen anything like it. Arrive early when it opens and the whole place is yours. It is absolutely beautiful.,,
,,Sakura!,5,,Every year I come back GBB for Sakura. I am a Japanese who stay Singapore 25years but Sakura season unable to going back to Japan so I missed sakura. GBB sakura make me happy. Thank u GBB!,,
,,Simply excellent in every respect (maybe except the crowds!),5,,"OK you've probably already made up your mind that you are going to gardens by the bay based on reviews here! And you should definitely go...its awesome! BUT....crowds are a real bummer, people tripping over each other with phones, selfie sticks....its a damn nuisance! My single piece of advice...go early or late!",,
,,paradise for gardenlovers,5,,"gardens by the bay is unique, lots of different gardens, and the flowerdome was amazing with japanese exhibition goin on the time we were there. clouddome was superexperience for us, so many plants and nice vieuws from the top of the dome",,
,,Returning after 5 years,5,,"Dramatic change in the Gardens between our last visit. We did the aerial boardwalk between the sky trees. Amazing views! We were there on a Monday evening, had to queue for about 30 min to get a time slot. Tickets are 8 dollars, no concessions. At your allocated time, you have to queue again to take the lift upto the boardwalk. For me personally although early evening is more popular and more crowded, it鈥檚 the best time to go up. As the day turns to evening, and the lights start to switch on.
You are advised to spend maximum 15 minutes, as it鈥檚 peak time. The spaces around get filled up quickly as people settle down to watch the light show.
Most are happy to ly or sit on the floor.
It鈥檚 a different perspective to other light shows, as you are directly below the structures.
Our son who is 9 enjoyed it, nice compilation between light and sound. A leisurely walk back to the Marina sands, and you can catch the 9pm show there aswell.
Bear in mind after the show, it鈥檚 congested at MRT exits as an exodus as people from the park.
Nice way to end a day of sight seeing.",,
,,Superb display and free access,5,,We came to watch the gardens by the bay light show. It was a superb show and well worth a visit. Plenty of space on the grass to sit with the family. Must do whilst in Singapore.,,
,,A bit disappointed,3,,"I went to Garden by the Bay, however, the cloud dome was closed for maintenance. My friend told me I have to spend 1.5 hours in a dome, however, I stayed there in 45 minutes. There is not much to see inside, unless you are interested in bottle trees, that's indeed very interesting. However, compared to the National Orchard Garden, which is S$5 entrance fee, I like the National orchard garden a lot more.",,
,,Worth the visit,5,,"Enjoyed everything about gardens by the bay, great light show and interesting display of various plants and flowers",,
,,Nice Botanical gardens,4,,Two different biodiversity centres. Well laid out . A bit of a walk to get to. There is option to pay for shuttle servce,,
,,My 5th visit to Gardens By The Bay. Love the exhibitions time to time.,5,,"multiple visits for the different exhibitions throughout the year...went in March 2019 for the Sakura, nice but really packed in the afternoon on weekends and holidays. Kids love the Domes. Will visit again.",,
,,Do not miss visiting!,5,,Visiting Gardens by the Bay was a multi-sensory delight! The fragrance and the beauty of the vast collection of flowers and fauna were immeasurable. I loved the displays and the architectural design were exceptional. This was one of the major highlights of my trip to Southeast Asia!,,
,,Highlight in Singapore! Very attractive park and spectacular light show,5,,"The park is a 鈥淢ust See鈥?in Singapore. During the day and in particular after sunset.
Don鈥檛 miss the light show in the evening ( free of charge). We always enjoyed the spectacular view from the rooftop of the Indochine Bar (on top of the central 鈥渢ree鈥?",,
,,Green garden,4,,"Our sunny island is pretty much summer all year round. With hot scorching sun rays especially from months of March till Sep ..

This airconditioned big and beautiful garden houses so many green plants , shrubs, flowers and little trees!

Seasonally changes with the various themes and one should visit GBTB least once..

Not much eateries around so do pack light snacks and water.",,
,,Must see attraction,5,,"I鈥檝e visited Singapore several times but never made it to the Gardens By The Bay so it was top on my list for this time. It did not disappoint! We went on a Sunday, and we鈥檙e worried about the crowds on the weekend but found most venues to be reasonably quiet and we did not have to wait in any lines for attractions or food. I do suggest arriving early to take advantage of the cooler weather and fewer people, as the crowd did increase as the day progressed. The skyway and Supertree grove walk, a separate admission price, is well worth the price for stunning overviews of the park. The well air-conditioned flower dome was my favorite area of the park and included integrated sculptures and artwork throughout the displays. The venue is divided up by different climates and highlighted local species from around the world. Stunning. There was a lot of walking involved, as it鈥檚 a very large park, so we found that purchasing the unlimited access shuttle ticket for an additional three dollars was handy. We spent a full day there and I would plan a minimum of 4 hours for a visit.",,
,,An experience for all,4,,We visited the gardens first at night and watched the night show. I would really say this is a must do if you鈥檙e visiting singapore. We then came back the following day and walked around the top of the trees. It was around $5-8 entry which is really worthwhile for the views.,,
,,Awesome,5,,What a great place to visit (if you like gardening). Day & night visits are out of this world. Just don't miss it.,,
,,I loved spending evenings here,5,,"The best part is that only the domes have paid entry and the rest of the area is free to explore. You can rent scooters and ride along the riverside. It is green all around and the light show is free every night. Must visit this area, just explore the free area.",,
,,Truly a must see,5,,"To really see it all and experience everything that is here would take more than a day. The best part is that most of it is free. There is a charge for the tree walk and also the 2 special gardens in the domes, but considering how much is here it's a great place to spend some extended time. Don't rush through. Plan on walking the paths and exploring. Be sure and be here at night with light show in the super trees. Access is easy.",,
,,Another world,5,,"Beautiful garden ...Money is worth what you pay for. Cloud forest was amazing, loved the water fall there.Beautiful plants and an amazing ecosystem they have created .Flower dome didn't have much flowers as expected.But it is a different world for garden lovers.",,
,,AMAZING,5,,Place everyone must visit! Both of the domes are amazing. Don鈥檛 miss the light show. Looking forward to visit the new areas,,

Gardens by the Bay is a huge, colourful, futuristic park in the bay area of Singapore. Among the standout features are the famous Supertree structures. These offer an impressive skywalk over the gardens, with oversized seashell-shaped greenhouses that recreate chilly mountain climates. There are hundreds of trees and plants to discover within, making Gardens by the Bay a great destination for both kids and grownups, and simply for those looking for a respite with stunning views.
Gardens by the Bay covers 250 acres of reclaimed land on the waterfront. The best spot to get an idea of the sheer size of the Gardens is from the top of Marina Bay Sands, directly opposite the park. Getting here is easy, either via walkways from the hotel, which give you elevated views or by taking the slightly longer riverside promenade to enter the park near the 2 domes. Walking around the park won鈥檛 cost you a cent but there is a fee if you want to step inside the climate-controlled conservatories or walk amongst the Supertrees. There is no doubting the dominance of the steel-framed 鈥榯ree鈥?plantation, towering over Gardens by the Bay with 12 of the large metal structures in the central grove and half a dozen others placed in other parts of the garden. Over 200 different species of plants and flowers cover the exterior of these tall upright gardens 鈥?twice a night, at 7.45pm and 8.45pm, they are a centrepiece of the gardens鈥?light and music show, casting a glow over the park, and making you feel like you are in a modern fairy tale. For those who like a view, take the trip 25 metres up to the remarkable walkway that connects 3 of the trees together. The 50-metre tree in the centre offers 360-degree panoramas of the Gardens as well as Marina Bay.

The 50-metre tree in the centre offers 360-degree panoramas of the Gardens as well as Marina Bay. The Greenhouses at Gardens by the Bay If you need to cool down, head into Cloud Forest, the smaller shell-shaped structure with a 35-metre-high mountain covered in plants that usually thrive in tropical highlands. Don鈥檛 worry if climbing feels too much, there is a lift that takes you up into the mist and gives you a great view looking down over the walls of plants and orchids. The Flower Dome is also cooler than outside, recreating the drier climes of places like California and the Mediterranean. In this gigantic conservatory, you will find yourself on a journey around the world, with Baobabs from Africa, Olive trees from Spain, Kangaroo Paw from Australia. Inside the Flower Dome, you鈥檒l also find Pollen, a Mediterranean restaurant that creates dishes using herbs and vegetables grown in-house.
The Rest of the Garden If you arrive via Bayfront MRT you will first have to walk past the Dragonfly and Kingfisher lakes. If you have enough time, walk along the boardwalk to discover the many birds and insects that have made this area their home. In a nod to the different nationalities that have settled in Singapore over the years, there is a series of four interconnecting gardens with plants and trees from India, China, Malaysia and the Colonial garden. Besides Pollen and Supertree by Indochine, you can also find a host of casual restaurants to try: Cafe Crema offering sandwiches and snacks, Seventh Heaven serving up ice creams, and Verandah, a traditionally inspired black and white bungalow that serves Asian and international cuisines. Gardens by the Bay鈥檚 location makes it an easy getaway from Singapore鈥檚 traffic and skyscrapers. It offers a fun space to explore horticulture from around the world. But even better than that, the Supertrees, Cloud Forest, and Flower Dome bring plants to life in a way you鈥檝e probably never seen before.",,
,,Incredible Gardens,5,,"Amazing to see so much beauty in amongst Singapore. The gardens are a wonder every time you turn a corner but design of the gardens, water features and the sky walk are incredible.",,
,,Must visit here,4,,"Eye catching man made garden. Visitor should come in the evening, but before 6.00 p.m. Very nice after the sunset. Recommended to bring children. Have to walk a lot, therefore, bring a water bottle.",,
,,A must do in Singapore but misses a climate change point,4,,"An absolute must-do when visiting Singapore, this place is really impressive. The scale of the gardens is mind blowing and while it's very busy it also feels tranquil and it is possible to find peaceful spaces to enjoy nature.
The climate change exhibition is good, and I'm very glad it's there, but it misses some very important points about the relationship between the economic system and climate change: it fails to address the need to curb growth if we are to take climate change seriously, instead suggesting that individual behaviour change is all that's needed.",,
,,PHOTOSHOOT,5,,Best place for photoshoot so many picturesque place. Dome is pricey for us but worth it for at least 1 visit,,
,,"Worth two visits, day and night",5,,"This is definitely one of the great attractions in Singapore. Try to visit in the daytime and also at night to see all the ""trees"" lit up and also witness one of the two nightly Garden Rhapsody light shows that play out amongst those trees. The Gardens are free all the time and all you pay for is to visit the two great domes, the Cloud Forest and the Flowers. The former is terrific and actually worth what you pay for both but in comparison I found the latter a little tame and ordinary. There is also a charge to go up to the Skyway walkway. The Gardens tend to be quieter on weekday mornings and you should find few queues but in the evening there can be long waits to access the Walkway as only limited numbers are permitted on it at any one time. The Gardens are within easy walking distance from Bayfront metro station and well signposted.",,
,,Gardens by the Bay,5,,"Having seen so many pictures of this lovely gardens, it was the first item on our itinerary. And when we got there, it was stunning! 鉂わ笍 We took the metro to reach the gardens. The entrance to the gardens is free but the sky deck costs SGD 8 per adult. Although looking at the fee, many would be put off from going above, but I strongly suggest going for it! The view from above is so beautiful. You tend to appreciate both the gardens and city from up there. It can get crowded and the pictures may come out a bit fuzzy as there would be a lot of people up there with you, but I enjoyed it very much! If you are scared of heights, hold on to the rails as the walkway tends to sway a little bit. Lovely start to our Singapore trip 鉂わ笍",,
,,Well worth a visit,5,,A great way to spend several hours wandering amongst these beautiful gardens. The Flower Garden and Cloud Forest are worth paying to visit. The night light shows are fantastic.,,
,,Impressive but crowded on a Sunday,4,,"I knew it would be busy on a Sunday but the weather forecast meant it had to be this day, so very crowded with very noisy children everywhere. Enjoyed the domes, the cloud forest was really amazing but be warned that if you are not keen on heights, you can see through the mesh on the overhead walkway! The sound and light show makes a nice experience, I recommend arriving at the gardens around 4 to have time to look around and then take in the 7.45pm show. Also, amazing views of Marina Sands hotel and skydeck.",,
,,A must visit when in Singapore,5,,"The Gardens by the bay have taken over as one of the best places to visit in Singapore, and rightly so, as there is so much to see, most of which is free. During our visit we visited both the flower dome and the rain forest dome both were very impressive and a must see, this cost a total of 拢13.50 per person for both domes. The gardens are easily walkable with plenty of trees and flowers to interest most people. There is also a skywalk and a restaurant at the top of one of the towers although there are plenty of eating places in the gardens. The gardens are open late into the night and are very impressive when lit up.",,
,,Nice place,5,,Wonderfully we passed our all moments here. Very enjoying place to go. Recommend to go once to enjoy your holiday.,,
,,One of my favourite places in Singapore,5,,"Ten of us took a day trip to visit the Flower dome, the Rain forest and the newly set up Japanese garden during the Cherry Blossoms display season. It is worth visiting during the day and stay on to admire the lights at the supertree area at night.",,
,,1st visit to Singapore,4,,"We stop by the merlion park and walk our way to the gardens by the bay and by the time we got there we were all exhausted. After visiting the Supertree, cloud forest and flower dome it was all worth it. These places are very impressive if you love the forest and flowers.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,The outdoor gardens are stunning and worth a visit. I paid 28 to go in the two domes; cloud forest with the waterfall is worth it; the other dome was way too cold and I couldn't wait to leave. Even if you don't go in the domes it's worth a visit. There's a wonderful childrens play area for families and tons of information on conservation.,,
,,Worth worth worth the visit,5,,This place is both amazing and nice location to go for a walk around and visit the two flower domes. This is a must to visit in Singapore One if its iconic place Nothing more to say Just go,,
,,Just perfect,5,,"We went on our last day in Singapore and I'm so glad we did.

Everything about Gardens by the Bay is impressive, from their impeccable floors, restrooms, to their nice people always willing to help.

The amount and variety of flowers we saw were outstanding and the gorgeous landscape design was on point, nothing but the best to match the magnitude of the important Marina Bay Sands Hotel, where this Garden is located.

The only thing I didn't like was the temperature inside the flower domes because it was so cold, I was practically freezing, but I understand that they do this to maintain the flowers and other plants.",,
,,Part of short visit to Singapore,3,,"I was very much looking forward to visiting 'gardens by the bay'. Unfortunately,due to late afternoon/evening rain I was unable to go at my preferred time. The outcome being I went the next evening (my last in Singapore) with a tight schedule, The gardens are sensational but not a wide range of species. The wait & crowd for the music light show (only 15 minutes) was a disappointment.. My Singapore highlights were the botanical Gardens & the Zoo.",,
,,Evening walk,5,,"This is the 2nd time in Singapore for us, the first time being 2015 for the Formula 1 Grand Prix.
As this was a night race we didn't get to see the Gardens in the Bay, but when we did see them this time....OMG absolutely fantastic. We arrived too late to see any specific areas ie the indivudual gardens,so just walked round looking at trees.
Just before closing at 9pm they put on a show to orchestral music greater than any firework display you have seen. Everyone lies down on the concrete and just stares at the show right before their eyes. IT IS AMAZING.
You have got to see this at the end.",,
,,A Must see for anyone who Loves Garden and Plants,5,,"If you are visiting Singapore this is a must visit destination, everything about it is outstanding and exceeds expectations, words do not do it justice. Just go and enjoy.",,
,,beautiful gardens,4,,"so well set out and the indoor sections are a cool respite from the hot humid weather.
Orchids and other exotic plants flourish here and as you walk through you would think you were up in the mountains where they grow.
Lovely gift shop and cafes.The giant metal trees are illuminated at night.",,
,,A must,5,,"This is the second time I have been here and it was even better than the first visit. Building a environmentally sustainable rainforest in the heart of Singapore is quite a spectacular feat. The cool climate makes it easy to stay and enjoy for several hours (both sections - international gardens and the cloud forest) and the views over parts of the city are superb. Make sure you book online and save on the entry fees and waiting in the queues.

Perhaps the best feature for me is the way in which the cloud forest leaves you with key messages at the end of the tour of how one can, and must, play a part in improving the environment we live in and enjoy.",,
,,Great place for recreation,5,,"Garden so beautiful with a nice mix of water, plants, trees, walking paths. Great for a stroll or a morning jog along the river!",,
,,review on GArden by the bays,4,,"Attracted by the Christmas theme. Third visit to GBTB. pretty lighting. My first time getting ticket for the shuttle in, worth the price though.",,
,,Very Crazy Rich Asians,5,,"Amazing, and it鈥檚 free!!! Especially if you鈥檙e a CRA fan! P.S get to the tree show 30 min early and if you鈥檙e high maitenece bring something to sit on.",,
,,Lots of Good Things Here,4,,"This is a huge and expensive (to build) attraction. But Singapore already has a fantastic Botanic Garden full of amazing plants, which makes me wonder why they aren鈥檛 working together.
Gardens by the Bay does have the vast biomes containing plants from around the world and these are impressive and educational. It鈥檚 in Marina Bay so the tourists can get there easily, and, it is almost entirely air conditioned. I do have a problem with this last bit: I know it鈥檚 incredibly hot and humid but to air condition an area this size can鈥檛 be environmentally friendly, especially as there is a section at the end where you get lectured about climate change. Hopefully somebody will come to their defence and correct me on this explaining that the power is entirely renewable energy. In fairness it鈥檚 probably no worse than the hotels and malls.
If you like plants it鈥檚 worth a visit: they have some amazing trees and palms and it鈥檚 a fantastic advert for living walls.",,
,,Fantasy Land,4,,"Singaporean is so lucky and should be proud of this so pretty Garden by the Bay. Right in the city, easily accessible, and one can spend a good few hours in the park leisurely. My experience, I first started at the Merlions on Fullerton, advise you to go after 4 when sun is not as burnt, then leisurely make your way to garden by the bay, a good 25 minutes to reach ticket booth. Suggest to buy tickets online to avoid lining up. Visit various gardens, then admit to Flower Dome, then Cloud Forrest, by around 7:45, one can admire the beautiful Super Tree lighting show. Find yourself a good spot right under the Tree, the show is around 15 minutes, you will definitely applaud. When hunger finally hits you, go to the nearby Lau Pau Sa Market for good satays, good Singapore food, you're feeling you're the luckiest person on earth... Happy camper...",,
,,Wonderful experience,5,,Allow at least three hours but you could spend all day enjoying this place. Taxis frequent the rank. In our case we didn鈥檛 even have to wait.,,
,,OUTSTANDING EXPERIENCE,5,,dome covered with aircond was really helpful during our trip. I don鈥檛 think we can survived with 4 months old baby with 30鈥機 weather. Beautiful sceneries with a lot of flowers!,,
,,Christmas wonderland,4,,"Worth it. The size and breadth is amazing. The 2 domes were wonderful, magic air con for such a large space. Christmas lights were great, though it was very busy.... Use grab, as the queues leaving were crazy",,
,,Unique,5,,"Flower dome is really wonderful , themes if different regions like Asia, Australia, America,Africa with Hybrid Flowers/Trees make even 2 hrs insufficient. Cloud Forest is amazing needs another 2 hrs and sight of endangered insectivorous plants is a visual delight for children.",,
,,Fantastic Light Show,5,,"Loved our visit here and the experience of the light show, stunning and definitely recommend this experience!",,
,,Fantastic and well worth going to,5,,"What a fabulous place to visit, love the air conditioning so you can take the time to take in the sculptures and huge variety of gardens. Well worth going to.",,
,,Excellent,5,,Excellent garden setup with playground . Good for kids . Nice place to walk in the evening high recommended,,
,,Romantic,4,,Interesting light show and the garden itself is amazing. You can view the show from the bridge or you can go down and walk through the garden. But my personal recommendation is to watch the show from the garden and not the bridge,,
,,Must,5,,"Walk and watch, enjoy, drink a lot of water, this place makes you sweat. But its the first thing you should do in Singapore",,
,,crying in happiness!,5,,"Went there at night as a planned. our purpose is just to see the glowing gardens.. it was so beautiful and amazing. when we just about to leave, around 8.30pm, suddenly the lights went off, we were surprised, but it turned up to be a light show. super awesome! I even cry cause it was my birthday. My friend who had been to Singapore doesn't even know that they have the show every 8.30pm. so we were lucky. the music, the lights, the ambience just too wonderful!",,
,,Star attraction of Singapore,5,,"We were there during the Sakura (cherry blossom) season - the whole place was rocking in light pink hue.

My suggestion is that you should not rush. Move leisurely and enjoy all leaves and flowers collected from different parts of the world -- a magnificent and rare experience

The cloud garden with artificial water falls and a hillock however, does not attract me. The place looks too artificial . The stalactite and stalagmite section is a let down. The The short video presentation on climate change is a ""must see"".The carnivorous plants is a star attraction.especially for the kids.",,
,,Sakura,3,,It was nice to see the Sakura in bloom after leaving Japan some years ago. It brought back some good memories.,,
,,Unique,5,,Gardens by the Bay has already become an iconic tourist attractions. There is nothing else like it in the world. Part Avatar imitation part educational representation of the major biomes it is fascinating for all. There are already plans afoot for other cities to copy it.,,
,,Amazing,5,,Visited here twice now and both times have been different. Found new sculptures to look at second time round. The work is amazing,,
,,Gardens well worth a visit- and come back at night for the light show,5,,"The cloud and flower dome in the garden have an entry fee but are worth a visit, especially during the heat of the day since they are air conditioned. I liked the cloud dome slightly more, simply due to the different heights and layout and the water element. Make sure to come back at night for the super tree light show- themes change regularly and it鈥檚 free. Find a spot to recline and prepare to be impressed by the changing lights set to music. It doesn鈥檛 sound like it would be all that good but it is really amazing- don鈥檛 miss it!",,
,,Out of this world,5,,A must see. Completely enjoyable there no place quite like this. Be prepare for the climate change I would recommend a throw on shirt is available.,,
,,Must see,5,,"Not just the bio-domes, but the entire area. Needs a full day to experience everything. Must see the gardens and light show in the evening.",,
,,Amazing!,5,,"Absolutely beautiful. Reasonably priced and such lively bonaticals to see. The aircon in the domes was amazing cimpared to the heat outside, just thos is worth a visit hah. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Could not imagine visiting singapore and not coming here. Well worth the visit, only niggle is fighting our way through the ""amateur photographer's"" and posing women making sure theu get the best gram!",,
,,Wow!,5,,"The gardens by the bay is a very favourite spot for tourists. There is coach upon coach upon coach arriving there . Well what can one say - the gardens are fantastic, you need to spend about 4 hours there . A must visit is all I can say .",,
,,Totally amazing,5,,A totally amazing park. I recommend both the Cloud Forest & the Flower Dome. You can walk to the domes from the ticket office or take a shuttle which you have pay for. I'd suggest the Cloud Forest Dome first as it's the most impressive. It contains a six storey bio structure with some of the most amazing plants and flowers. Both domes are temperature controlled so expect it to be a bit chilli. The Flower Dome has a collection of plants & trees from all over the world.,,
,,Incredible treat for everyone,5,,Devote several hours to exploring every part of this incredible garden. Try to enjoy the super tree show at night too,,
,,Amazing!,5,,"These gardens are just incredibly beautiful, by day and night. One must not miss special light show in the evening. Just walking arround and looking at this beauty make you relaxed. Fantastic.",,
,,A Must Do in Singapore,5,,This place is truly beautiful ....the light show is amazing....the music powerful and the colours forever changing...go early to get a good place to sit ...you will be mesmerised by the experience,,
,,"Quite simply, Amazing.",5,,"Of course we had heard so much about this place, but nothing prepared us for the reality. The Garden Domes were exceptional, and unlike anything I鈥檇 ever seen. Incredible. Then the light show in the evening moved me to tears. Wow. Not to be missed.",,
,,Celebrations,3,,"My husband and I looked here to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. I had originally booked a table for 8 o鈥檆lock the previous day but asked if I could switch to the following day at the same time. I was told the only availability was at 6 pm which we accepted. However having vacated our table at 8 pm we were most surprised to find many available tables at this time.
Every table has a nice view, and seating is comfortable.
The food, whilst pleasant , is either luke warm or cold as everyone seem to have food served on cold plates. The drinks are the same price as elsewhere in Singapore but the food is a little more expensive but you鈥檙e paying for fabulous views.
All in all, I would suggest that you drink here and eat elsewhere. Nothing was made of our silver anniversary despite advising the restaurant on booking. This, (whilst not expecting anything) compared to other restaurants visited here who acknowledged our celebrations, was a shame.
You can access as good a view from the Singapore Flyer or the Marina Bay Hotel.",,
,,beautiful garden displays,5,,"fantastic display of gardens from around the world, great way to spend a few hours, all air conditioned which is a blessing in the hot weather. Particularly interesting if you are into gardening. If you aren't it is still worth a look. It is very well done.The cloud forest is great and has an eerie atmosphere when the misting is turned on.",,
,,i am in awe of this place!,5,,"I had heard everyone say ""You have to see gardens by the Bay!"" and yes you absolutely do!
the giant trees are just amazing and the surrounding gardens are just as beautiful. it is mother nature at her finest mixed with man made sculpture! I highly recommend going up to the top of the giant tree where they have a restaurant and bar.. sit inside or outside among the pink metal branches and enjoy the amazing 360 degree view! if that doesn't wow you then take a walk over to the glass bubble dome things! WOW WOW WOW! the flower dome sounds like something your nana would want to go and see but it is amazing! (and also nice and cool and a nice relief from the heat outside!) these domes are way huger than I expected and absolutely breath taking.. they take you on a journey through different types of plants from cacti to stunning rainforests and then amazing cherry blossoms where you would swear you were in japan! then just when you think it cant get any more amazing - you enter the rainforest dome. the waterfall and MASSIVE vertical gardens will blow your mind! the walking paths along the way take you up in, around, behind and in front of the giant waterfall. the mist makes it look even more special and there are some surprises along the way too ( I don't want to spoil it for you! )
make sure you allow yourself enough time to really explore because it is way more amazing than you expect it to be! we went early afternoon and began our adventure with a trip to the observation deck of the marina bay sands hotel. well worth the $20! the enjoyed the gardens all afternoon and stayed for the light show at 8pm. I recommend finding a spot where you can see all of the metal trees because the show is really great and worth a look.",,
,,Light show spectacular,5,,"The Supertree light show was great. We didn鈥檛 do this, but would be fun to watch the light show from the skywalk. You would have to take the 7:40 or 8:40 skywalk (for the 7:45 or 8:45 show).",,
,,This is an absolute must when visiting Singapore,5,,First when you walk into both the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest you really appreciate the fact that it is so cool and comfortable. It is all spectacular to wander about and look at. They have done an amazing job on the design and upkeep here. We spent several hours walking about here and marveling at the beauty. The flowers and plants at both places are so pretty and such a wide variation as well as the designs of the art works and walkways. I think this is by far my favorite place in Singapore. We had a combo ticket for the gardens by the bay and OCBC skywalk for about $22.50 USD.,,
,,You will not be disappointed,5,,This was one of the reasons I came to Singapore for vacation. It was every bit as good as it looks on all the pictures. The light show is amazing. Come early and walk around the gardens. Enjoy the art installations as well as the domes. If you are hungry there is a hawker center on sight.,,
,,Confusing maps and direction.,2,,"Impressed with the vegetation, the design of the whole park but not so on the management. Signboard/ information board is very confusing right from the main entrance- you have no idea where is the direction from one attraction to another. The OCBC tree top walks started with a complete disaster- the staff will pass you a poorly printed card to show you the time to come back for your slot- no indication given after that. Walked to the lift area and no one was ready at that area. Visitors literally walked in to the lift and get up to the top, get down after walked through the bridge. Someone should have stand-by at the entry and exit at least.",,
,,TO VISIT,5,,Beautiful paradise!!! You will enjoy bring with you a hat! The sunshine and the glare are strong!!! I went many times!!!,,
,,Fabulous,5,,What a spectacular must do place to visit in Singapore. Not overly crowded when we visited but I can see this being a busy place in the high season. Spectacular place to visit. Reasonably priced. A must do,,
,,Good place to see if you like gardens and plants,5,,"The place has two garden domes to see, which has many plants from all over world, a skywalk to walk on, which give you a good view of some of the city and a lightshow, which is free, showing 2 or 3 times of the night.",,
,,Beautiful Gardens,4,,"The Gardens By the Bay are a definite must do when you are in Singapore. The gardens are stunning and so diverse. We spent a couple of hours walking round, taking lots of photos, very interesting",,
,,Stunning displays! Do not miss this!,5,,"Adjacent to Marina Bay Sands Hotel, the indoor gardens were decorated with cherry trees in full blossom, hydrangeas, tulips, and other beautiful spring flowers. Both indoor buildings are full of trees, bushes, flowering plants and cactus on display. A beautiful sight! The waterfall is not to be missed! It is truly a sight and you can take an elevator up to the top and walk your way down the ramp to the base of the waterfall. There are outdoor paths to follow with as well which include statues, flowers etc.",,
,,Get there in time for the sound and light show,5,,We got to the gardens in time to see the supertrees sound and light show. They occur twice each night at 7:45 & 8:45 pm. The show is free. The trees look amazing and the lights dance in time to the music. It was really lovely to watch. It lasts 15 minutes. After the show we visited the dome to see the cherry blossom and Japanese gardens. It was a very warm evening but inside the dome it was lovely and cool. The Japanese music and water gardens were so relaxing. There is an admission fee for the dome. From the gardens you can see the most amazing architecture of Singapore the hotel that looks like a boat has landed on top of it! Fabulous.,,
,,Casual and nice.,4,,My friend and I liked the attractions and there were new sights at Flower Dome. It was a great afternoon :),,
,,Superb,4,,"We enjoyed the Garden by the bay especially the cloud dome .Stayed only for 1 hour since it was already closing time,nevertheless its good .But I assumed that the shuttle going to the front or mrt is free but it wasn't .You have to pay S$3.00 each.",,
,,other worldly and spectacular,5,,go at night to catch the light show walk to it and around it you will not be disappointed.Stay at the marina bay sands for quick and easy access ... it is also a free attraction,,
,,Unmissable,5,,"No visit to Singapore is complete without a visit to the iconic Supertree Grove at Gardens by the Bay. Easily accessible via Bayfront MRT station, the gardens themselves are actually free to visit. But if you want to access the aerial walkway that links up the Supertrees, there鈥檚 a $8 charge. There鈥檚 also an entry fee to the two botanical gardens, which are covered by large domes ($28 for both). The cooler temperatures inside domes can provide a welcome respite from the heat. And if you鈥檝e only got time to visit one, the waterfall in the Cloud Mountain dome is truly awesome. On site catering includes a cafe next to the south ticketing booth and a bar in the canopy of one of the Supertrees.",,
,,This is pretty amazing,5,,"Thanks to the advice of a taxi driver i got here later in the day. The internal forests are amazing. The gardens outside are really lovely but the heat got to me so i did not stay for evening.
A good time to go is 3pm.",,
,,Worth a visit,5,,Beautiful and diverse gardens. Spent 3-4 hours here and couldve easily spent more. Not to expensive either. Recommended.,,
,,A must see tourist attraction - Excellent & Beautiful,5,,"The 'Gardens By The Bay,' is a must see despite the costly admission. Bring you camera and take your time - don't rush taking photos - stp and smell the roses. Thre's also some fantastic pictures you can take of the Sands Marina Hotel from this site. Go back in the evening for the free lazor-light show. Enter through the Marina Sands Hotel & follow the signs. The ligtt show is breathtaking.",,
,,Must See,5,,"How wonderful the gardens are, amazing the design and work that has made these beautiful gardens. See gardens from all around the world. The rain forest is fantastic.",,
,,Beautiful utopia,4,,"Definitely a must see when in Singapore. Absolutely beautiful, great experience. The light show during evenings is amazing, beyond words. Got three individual attractions; flower dome, cloud forest and skywalk or something on supertrees. Outside garden is free to roam. Few places to eat that get super crowded after the light shows. Prepare to walk alot.",,
,,Great peaceful area,5,,Good area to get away from the city. Nice gardens and sculptures. Good views from the tree walk and light show in the trees inpressive,,
,,This is COMPULSORY,5,,"Apart from being one of the most relaxing activity one can do while in Singapore, it is also one of the most beautiful. The gardens are a show piece and a message to us all . Let鈥檚 all look after this rock of ours. Check out the Flower Garden and the Cloud Forrest well worth the $28.00. Opens 9:00a.m. Must be seen.",,
,,Perfect day out when the sun takes a break,5,,"I could finally enjoy the Gardens on a day when the sun took a break and the temperature and humidity were tolerable. Previously I had tried to visit at the peak of the sun, and it is almost impossible.

But in a cloudy and fresh day, it is a nice way to finish a visit to the Marina Bay area.",,
,,Always an amazing delight at the Flower Dome,5,,"My Wife and I are regular visitors and never fail to bring our overseas friends to visit Gardens by the Bay. At our recent visit to the Flower Dome we overheard the comment 鈥渨e don鈥檛 need to go to Japan, we can see the cherry blossoms here!鈥?And so it was and it was amazingly refreshing with the displays artistically presented to bring the flavour, sight and scent of a Sakura festival. We never tire of our visits each time as we are constantly delighted with new displays like roses, tulips etc through the Seasons and refreshingly different each time.",,
,,Well worth the visit,5,,"Singapore, does it so well. On the shores of the bay a beautiful man made tourist attraction. Everything is worth seeing and a walk to Satay by the bay gave us a group of otters as a special surprise!",,
,,Amazing place,4,,"My wife suggested me to visit this place which on my own I would have not. It is pricey but is worth it. Well done with lots of trees, plantes and so on all perfectly labelled",,
,,Nature nature in the city,5,,"Wow! Singapore knows how to combine city and nature the best way! Beautiful park, environmental message, technology, light show, food, friendly people. It鈥檚 a MUST if you come to Singapore!!!!",,
,,Amazing!,5,,An awful lot of time & careful planning has gone into the garden.....truly amazing. Loved every moment of our trip there. 馃ぉ馃ぉ馃ぉ definitely would go again....probably missed a bit....it is huge vast garden that really can't be seen in just one day.,,
,,cute,5,,amazing luv the light show and the environment. it was very nice and wasn't too hot around March time so it was great.,,
,,Not to be missed.,5,,"We visited during the day and spent hours walking round the gardens and the exhibitions in the domes.We also paid to climb to the skywalk which was great.We had a lovely lunch in the beautiful cafe
We returned at night for the light show which was amazing and not to be missed.Very busy but still had a great view.",,
,,A must visit attraction,5,,"Singapore has many tourist attractions and this woul definitely rank in the top 2. It is an amazingly magical place.
The themes are well thought out and the plants placed and grown to reflect this.
It's very busy at all times but they have excellent facilities and crowd control.
It's well worth the price of ticket paid. If you do not want to spend the money, you can go there in the evenings about 7.30 to be awed by the light and sound show",,
,,Nice flower and Amazing things Singaporenese can do,4,,"Like i said on title, it is incredible flowers and planet in this garden. Good to see flowers here, but smell was not so nice smell from any flowers i saw",,
,,Must visit,5,,A half day trip to the Gardens by the Bay is highly recommended. Try getting there post lunch so u can even catch the evening light show at 7pm.,,
,,Must spend 3-4 hours,4,,On my trip to Singapore spent few hours in these lovely gardens. Some of the areas was under maintenance but the cloud concept was great. Well management of traffic. Good design. And easy location.,,
,,Great Couple of Days,5,,"Beautiful country with loads to see. Very safe and clean. Booked a guided tour with Combi - tour guide, Bernard, was extremely knowledgeable and during the six hours we explored all areas including a short river cruise. We also walked through Eat Street and he took us to a great place for lunch where we sampled local ""hawker"" food - a lovely meal.",,
,,Cooling and pretty,5,,"Although the most famous sights of Gardens by the bay are of their supertrees outside, I think that the cloud and flower dome are well worth the entrance fee in. The domes are cooling and if i'm not wrong, theyre cooled by eco-friendly methods so thats a plus! It really gave a much needed respite from the Singapore heat. The flower exhibitions in the domes are also really pretty and provided much photo opportunities. I would say take your time in these domes, i find that they can be finished in a short amount of time. Nevertheless, I would recommend GBTB for a visit!",,
,,A Garden Paradise,5,,A spectacular garden giant glass house with plants from all over the world. Well worth a visit to both domes.,,
,,Gardens visit,5,,This is one of Singapore top attractions a visit to Singapore is not complete without a visit here allow 3to4hrs they have a shuttle that provides easy access to mobility patron's the camera never stopped going highly recommend the food in the outlets very reasonable getting here is easy go by met train ask said judge by photos provided,,

,,The Garden of the Century!,5,,Do not miss this unique garden with its super trees! The flower dome was extraordinary. We were sorry that the Cloud Forest was closed and we heard it was even better. We took the tram around the property which gives you a great bird's-eye view.,,
,,An amazing collection!,5,,"The Gardens include the two domes (Flower Dome and Cloud Forest), along with the famous Supertree Grove. Abundant plantlife, and pretty spectacular sculptures and artwork too. Lots to see and photograph, with many lakes and rivulets providing excellent scenic opportunity. The Gardens also have an Autonomous Vehicle capability - a must-try just to say you've been there and done it (well worth it too!). Expect to spend most of the day there, and if you are looking for a VERY good lunch, well the Marina Bay Sands Hotel is right next door!",,
,,Gorgeous gardens,5,,"A great place to visit especially if you love gardens (and even if you don鈥檛!). Wander around late afternoon, visit the Cloud Forest with a high viewing platform, the Flower Dome and see the light show on every night at 7.45 and 8.45. Easy to get to by train. Worth the visit.",,
,,Visiting the flower garden,5,,Plants and Habitats are only places in Singapore which they were naturally born and where do they grow.,,
,,Gardens By The Bay - Stunning,5,,"We spent an afternoon wandering around the Gardens By The Bay, there were so many plants and displays to enjoy. The planting and landscaping is exceptional, can only imagine the work that goes into here. The waterfalls (Cloud Forest) were stunning and views from the walkways. It is very well organised and a pleasure to visit.",,
,,Wonderful music and lights show!,5,,"Gardens by The Bay are a nice place to take a walk. We saw a wonderful music and lights show, with Pavarotti songs, too!",,
,,Fantastic,5,,What can one say but absolutely brilliant especially the evening light show. Great place to relax or perhaps to stroll.,,
,,A Must See in Singapore.,5,,"Allow 90 minutes for each dome. The nightly lights shows are amazing in the tree grove. We were luck enough to see from the skywalk but really, the show as seen on the ground is also amazing.",,
,,Stunning,5,,"We visited the Gardens at night time and I can honestly say it was magical.
You could lose yourself here for hours if you wanted to, as there are so many areas to wander around, or you can just sit on one of the numerous benches and just take in the views.",,
,,Beautiful Tranquil place to visit,5,,"The majority of Gardens by the Bay is free to get in. You only need to pay if you want to visit the Flower Dome, Cloud Forest and the OCBC Skyway. We visited the Flower Dome first and were lucky that the Japanese Cherry Blossom was in full bloom, and looked incredible. The dome is a beautiful place to visit with gardens designed from various continents. It's also a welcome relief from the heat and humidity. We spent around an hour in there and took lots of photos. You could easily spend more time in there especially if you listened to the audio tour.
The centre of the Cloud Forest is a mountain covered in vegetation with a waterfall. They have very cleverly designed the path ways that you walk around to take you up to the top and back down again. Misting happens several times a day.
The OCBC Skyway is set in the Supertree Grove area. It connects 2 of the Supertrees and is 22m above the ground and 128m long. It provides a lovely viewing platform for a different look at the gardens below. It is worth a visit. This is also the area where you can view the Garden Rhapsody Light Show. It is performed twice nightly and very impressive.

We purchased our ticket before we left the UK to cover the Flower Dome, Cloud Forest and the OCBC Skyway. There was no problem entering the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest, however we very nearly didnt get to visit the OCBC Skyway. Even though we had our ticket, you still have to go to the ticket counter to book a time slot. This was not mentioned in any of the paperwork we had with our tickets. So we watched the light show and then thought we would go to the skyway. We went to join the queue for the lift and it was at that point were told by the staff we needed to have the ticket stamped with a time. We quickly rushed to the ticket office and thankfully we got the last time slot of 8.20pm. Had we not made it, we would not have been able to visit as we were flying home the next day. They only allow a certain number of people at each time slot which are 20 mins apart. I would suggest that you go to the Supertree Grove when you first arrive at the Gardens and book your time slot.",,
,,Absolutely stunning,5,,What an amazing experience. You can't go to Singapore and not go here. A light and sound show that would impress everyone!,,
,,Beautiful,5,,We went in the pouring rain and still had a fabulous time! So beautiful. Saw the trees light up for the night show from the roof bar at the top of Marina Bay Hotel,,
,,Breath taking views,5,,For me I like cloud forest better than flowers dome where in cloud forest u can see amazing view of rainfall n can do skywalk also,,
,,What a brilliant place,4,,Loved it. Spent a few hours there but could have stayed all day. Very clean and made me think about the environmental issues we are facing.,,
,,Great Children鈥檚 Garden,5,,"Great place for kids. Free entry for the outside areas, but it is worth it to pay entry into the domes too. Bring swimwear and a towel for the kids garden as they have a big water play area as well as some play equipment. A good afternoon out for the whole family with a stop by Satay By The Bay for dinner.",,
,,Sakura,5,,Always good mood with plant and flowers... sakura look good in photo. Would be good if there are designated photo taking spot to make photo look better at which angle.,,
,,A delight not to be missed !,5,,These gardens are just sumptuous and an absolute must to visit! The architecture and the vegetation is just breathtaking !,,
,,A place not to be missed,5,,"If you only have limited time in Singapore, then I would suggest a visit to the ""Gardens by the Bay"" complex. I was amazed by the structures and amount of detail and plants that went into the domes. I can only reiterate the previous reviews and totally recommend this attraction. How anyone can put in a negative review about this place has serious issues.",,
,,Beautiful,5,,"If you go to Singapore, you must visit it. Especially at night, or some occasionally holiday like a winter. Sometimes there is a big event that will make the garden more beautiful, or mesmerizing like a snowfall in December even there is no snow in Singapore but it has in Garden by the bay",,
,,Fantastic gardens,5,,"The most beautiful experience,theGardens are great but the two hot house are fabulous well worth the money.",,
,,Fantastic light show,5,,"The Gardens by the Bay are the most fantastic site. Be sure to visit the domes and walk the bridge.
Make sure you have plenty of time, there's lots to look at.
The light show lasts 15mins and was the highlight of our visit, there are 2 shows each evening. The light shows are free.
There is an audio tour, about 20mins, which gives you a chance to see the vastness of the gardens and orientate yourself.
Please be aware that there is an extra cost to walk the bridge and to take the audio tour.
Most of the cafes and restaurants close well before the light show so plan around this.
Enjoy!",,
,,Spectacular,5,,Certainly one of many places to visit. Especially at night. Also the Marina Bay Sands hotel. A charge is made to go up to the top by the pool but this can be put towards a drink and is well worth it. Day or Night. The shops and resturants are amazing too.,,
,,Must visit,5,,Gardens by the bay is one of the must visit places in Singapore. Beautiful trees big garden and some extraordinary lighting to lit up the whole place in the night. Scenes to die for. Superbly maintained and a lush green space. Thums up to the people who work day in and day out to make this place worth a visit.,,
,,Walk by the bay,5,,"I enjoyed the gardens by the bay, the cloud forest, the flower dome. But the thing I enjoyed most is walk down the road by the bay, with the gentle wind.",,
,,Definitely a must visit in Singapore,5,,"A national garden and premier horticultural attraction for local and international visitors, Gardens by the Bay is a showpiece of horticulture and garden artistry that presents the plant kingdom in a whole new way.

Flower Dome : Spectacular and innovative, it is the largest glass greenhouse in the world as listed in the 2015 Guinness World Records!

Cloud Forest: A mysterious world veiled in mist. Take in breath-taking mountain views surrounded by diverse vegetation and hidden floral gems",,
,,Fun place to visit,5,,Enjoyed both domes and a nice place to cool down after the walk in the heat. The price is still expensive esp. for retirees. Great weelchair accessibility and places to rest your tired feet.,,
,,Must go place of Singapore,5,,Must go place of Singapore. Night show is the must thing. Start at day to visit cloud forest and flower dome in it and then end with night show.,,
,,Great view,4,,"Long walking from the bus but the view is great!
OCBC skywalk is not for some one who is scared of the height!
The Cloud forest and Flower Dome seems similar to me!
You need about 3 hours for 3 places: OBCB skywalk, Cloud Forest and Flower Dome.
One note if you buy ticket from Klook, you should remember to take your hard ticket at Red Dot DeSign Museum. There are two museums at 2 different directions ( the Red Dot DeSign Museum and Art Science Museum)!",,
,,Big Trees In A Green Space,4,,"This place (and the Marina Bay Hotel) are the images that most people see when they see pictures of Singapore. The trees in the garden are very large and are in a very large area that is easy and pleasant to walk around, especially seeing the trees lit up at night. It was nice there was not too much commercialism on the grounds. We attended the night/light show and while it was free, and certainly long enough, it did seem to me that the type of light show was a bit dated. I kind of expected some laser images and possibly other types of modern imagery and projections that we have seen in many other cities (i.e. Santiago, Chile). For most people, especially for Kids, I believe it will be an excellent experience and i am sure there are other parts of the gardens that were amazing that we didn't have time to visit.",,
,,Nice and organized,5,,It's an experience to go to Singapore. This place is very beautiful and staff are very organized. You need to go back in the evening so you could see the lights show which is free with your purchased ticket for the day,,
,,Fantastic place,5,,"Gardens by the Bay is a very impressive place, it鈥檚 worths visiting. Don鈥檛 go in a hurry, It鈥檚 better to reserve some hours to it. The public transport system in Singapore, including the metro helps a lot to visitors to reach there. If you are going at the middle of the day, it鈥檚 a good idea to protect yourself from the sun and don鈥檛 forget to take drinking water, to keep yourself hydrated.",,
,,Beautiful and magical..,5,,Really nice place to visit and enjoy the evenings. Easy to visit multiple times if you are staying at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel.,,
,,Amazing Spectacle,5,,Extensive array of gardens which include the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest which are a must-see. Entry to both is 28 Singapore dollars. Highlight is the night light show which takes place at 7.45pm and 8.45pm each evening in the area of the Supertrees. This is really magical and a unique experience. This alone made our trip to Singapore worthwhile.,,
,,An excellent way to spend an afternoon,5,,The Gardens are very conveniently located within a 20 minute walk or short taxi ride from downtown Singapore. The Flower Pavilion had a very oriental feel to it with our visit being very close to Chinese New Year and the Cloud Forest reminded us of temperatures akin to that with which we are more familiar with in the Northern Hemisphere. All the planting was of a very high standard with features such as the Waterfall and Treetop Walk giving things a real wow factor.,,
,,Must see attraction in Singapore,5,,"I would recommend to anyone visiting Singapore to visit the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest, as well as watch the light show at the Supertree Grove. Walking back after the light show one can get spectacular night shots of the Marina Bay Sands as you walk right under.",,
,,Beautiful green all around.,5,,"The super trees are what most people go for. The light show was good, but not as enlightening as others had said.

The real showshopper for me and my husband was the flower and cloud domes. We happened to go when they had this Japanese inspired exhibit and we got to see Cherry Blossoms in bloom! It was wonderful.
The whole area was climate controlled (which was magnificent, no one really explains to you the Singapore heat) signage everywhere to explain what one is looking at. Really was a great experience.",,
,,A fantastic experience,5,,"This is a beautiful place and it is difficult to believe that it was only created 10 years ago. There is no admission fee to the gardens although there is a fee if you want to visit the Flower Dome, cloud Forest or take the Tree Walk - all are well worth it. Plan your visit for the afternoon and evening as you cannot miss the two evening music/light shows. Plenty of eating places and benches to sit on if you get tired.",,
,,Visit in the heat of the day,4,,Pretty walk through of some beautiful plants and stalagmites / stalactites. Good for the hot afternoon. Wear walking shoes and take your time.,,
,,A Must Do!,5,,"As soon as we got out of the taxi, a volunteer approached us and gave us an overview of the complex which was really helpful - made great first impressions. First up we visited the Supertree Grove - felt like we were in the movie ""Avatar"" with the glorious huge tree structures - then walked across to the Flower Dome & Cloud Forest and bought our tickets for both.

Decided to visit the Flower Dome first. It was nice and cool 鈥?they had a special Japanese 鈥淪akura Matsuri Garden Trail鈥?exhibition on hence it needed to be cool for the wonderful cherry and plum blossoms. There were also flowers from other countries like South Africa with their gorgeous proteas. The exhibition was simply spectacular!

Afterwards we walked through the Cloud Forest 鈥?so many different species of flowers and plants to admire. The misting of the orchids occurs at set times and it was amazing to watch 鈥?also cooled us down too!

So glad we took the day out to see it .. would love to go back and see it again!",,
,,A Singapore must!,5,,"What a fantastic set up. We walked from Marina Bay Sands to the Flower Dome in the stifling Singapore heat and were very surprised and happy to feel the cool air conditioned climate that greeted us as we walked inside, phew, what a relief! This allowed us to take our time wandering amongst the recently blooming cherry blossom trees and various floral displays representing various countries. There were ample photo opportunities inside, however being a Sunday there were quite a few people also happy to get there mugs in our photos. After that we entered the Cloud Forest and were greeted by a huge waterfall throwing a mist over the crowd as they took their snapshots. All up a must see experience for all if you go to Singapore",,
,,Nice,5,,"A beautiful and unique reprieve from the city. They are nicely laid out and easy to explore. You can spend as little or as much time as you would like. It is in the city, but it does not feel like it is in a city.",,
,,You can't get enough of them!! Simply Majestic,5,,"Gardens by the Bay are not simply ""Gardens"". They are a world inside a Country known to have exceptional standards in terms of maintaining their high-class services, be it the Public Transport or all tourist attractions where people gather from all corners of the world.

As you step into the Gardens, you are awestruck by the Supertree Groves as it is ""One of a Kind"" structure and they look fantastic from up on the Skyway or in fact from the Garden Area.

Not to mention, there are two Dome Structures (Flower Dome and Cloud Forest Dome) - both are known as Cooled Conservatories and are man-made marvels. I've not seen such beautiful collection of Flowers arranged in a way to enhance the beauty of the Dome. Cloud Forest is a perfect expression of what you see as soon as you enter the Dome. Waterfall welcomes you with mist air making it cool naturally inside. To further cater to the name, there are misting timings where artificial mists are created to showcase a view to die for.",,
,,Just beautiful,5,,"This must be Singapore's gem. The gardens are beautiful and well maintained, safe and very clean. The super trees are just beautiful and light show not to be missed, but get there early as they get incredibly crowded. Get off at Bayfront station and follow the signs, it is well marked and an underground cool walkway is a bonus. Can walk up in the trees on the skyway for $8 which is worth it, again go early to avoid crowds. Just beautiful.",,
,,Breathtaking & surreal experience,5,,"Had a surreal experience. It is a huge, colourful, futuristic park, an oasis in the bay area of Singapore. The super tree grove is also a must see! We have started in the late afternoon and finished with the light show of the Super tree grove at night when they are lit up.",,
,,Kids had fun!,5,,There was an event on Japan with food & games and the kids enjoyed themselves at the flowers dome. Was crowded as it was during the weekends but that didn't spoil the fun.,,
,,Cloud Forest,5,,I only visited the Cloud Forest. Tickets were 22 dollars each for adults to access both. The Cloud Forest has the waterfall. It is beautiful inside. Very educational and futuristic. A must see.,,
,,Amazing,5,,One of my favorite places to visit in Singapore. Besides going into the 2 鈥渆nclosure鈥? have a walk around the open gardens outside. Nice for a morning walk as well,,
,,Surreal experience,5,,An oasis in the heart of Singapore. The human imagination and respect to nature. It wad fantastic to visit in the evening on time for the light show at 8pm.,,
,,Amazing,5,,This was just an amazing place..no wonder its the top attraction in Singapore. Light show finished off a fantastic visit,,
,,Interesting and Unusual,5,,"Very unusual structures with lots to see inside. Temperature controlled ..so it is cool! Must see the waterfall inside the Cloud Forest! The super tree grove is also a must see, during the day and at night when they are lit up. Very pleasant walking through many different gardens.",,
,,Perfect for running in the mornings.....,5,,I love Gardens by the Bay for my morning workout. There are runners around but if you go before 8am the sun is still down and its not so warm yet.,,
,,Relaxing gardens,4,,"Good access via SMRT train station, there is a lot to see and do, you can go on the sky walk for a good view over the gardens, there is a charge for this and it is not a time consuming event so over expensive.
Worth the effort for the garden experience.",,
,,Spectacular,5,,Words cannot describe the sheer spectacle you'll witness. Think Avatar world at the Cloud Dome and the Flower Dome had Japanese cherry blossom during March. It's a must-see. And the air-con for an afternoon jaunt is a very welcome respite from the afternoon humidity.,,
,,A wonderful experience,5,,"The Gardens By the Bay was a real highlight of our trip to Singapore. The super trees are fabulous but by far the most amazing part of the visit is the Cloud Forest. Even if you see no more of the gardens, or if you are not particularly interested in plants and gardens, the Cloud Forest is a must see!

A truly fabulous day out in wonderful Singapore!",,
,,Fabulous Evening Show,5,,"Amazing light show every evening at 8. played to different music. would recommend a drink in bar at the top of the Flower, excellent views",,
,,SUPERTREES!,5,,"It's hard to believe this must-see in Singapore is free of charge. And the Supertrees are so surreal you'll have hard a hard time believing they exist, until you see them for yourself. They're absolutely spectacular.
The gardens are spread out along the waterfront, and there's plenty of shade to hide from the blazing-hot sun. There are a few places to grab a bite to eat, and lots of signs to help you explore the Gardens.
And did I mention the Supertrees? There are 3 groves - silver, gold, and the main grove. They're colourful, alive, and totally surreal - kind of like Singapore itself.
Recommended: take the elevator up to the walkway from the Marina Bay Sands and arrive at the Gardens to a view of the trees from the lookoff. It will not disappoint.
I visited in the afternoon, and it was hot so I'd recommend visiting in the morning when it's cooler.
Oh, and the evening light show was fantastic - arrive a few minutes early and find a seat by the base of one of the trees or sit on the ground like everyone else.

If you found this review helpful, give it a thumbs up!",,
,,Gardens by the bay,5,,What in excellent experience and lovely light show good to visit you can see the Boat hotel opposite and walk around the garden is a good experience and inside the garden you can see beautiful and special plant.,,
,,Awesome Site - A Must Visit,5,,"I had no idea what to expect here but was blown away by the two giant domes and the skywalk. It鈥檚 a massive site immediately in front of the Marina Bay Sands, you would be remiss not to check it out.",,
,,"Air conditioned domes great, especially with children",5,,Visited and paid to go into the domes. Amazing to have an air conditioned activity for our baby in the hot cit centre. Domes were beautiful with lots of lovely flowers and statues. Lovely day out,,
,,Fabulous Spectacle,5,,"Just magnificent .. a must for anyone visiting Singapore - you won鈥檛 be disappointed. Beautiful, interesting, refreshing - an easy walk. Staff knowledgeable and friendly. Prices ok.",,
,,Beautiful at night.,4,,"It's a must to visit the gardens by the bay in the evening when it's dark, they perform a music and light show, something to see. It's a little over the top but it's definitely something to see when you visit Singapore. And you won't be alone there.",,
,,"Superb visualization of Nature and art, and even better execution of Human imagination into reality !!!",5,,"Gardens by the Bay are living example of how human imagination and art coupled with nature when translated in to reality can create wonders !!!! The place has various sections - Flower dome, Cloud forest dome, Super tree grove, Childrens' park, The Canyon, Sun Pavilion and much more !!! One needs atleast one full day from moring 9 am to evening 9 pm to see the place and appreciate its beauty fully !!!!

Gardens by the Bay is basically a nature park spanning over 250 acres of mostly reclaimed land in the Central area of Singapore. It is very close to the Marina Reservoir. The park has 3 waterfront gardens - Bay South Garden, Bay East Garden and Bay Central Garden. Its Flower Dome is the largest glass greenhouse in the world!!!

Gardens by the Bay is part of Singapore's plans to transform its ""Garden City"" to a ""City in a Garden"" !!! It has now become Singapore's premier urban outdoor recreation space and a national icon. The park receives millions of tourists every year. It offers complete family entertainment package. We went there on Christmas day and had loads of fun especially at the party at the Super Tree grove.

Its a must must visit destination for anyone coming to Singapore !!!",,
,,Beautiful way to spend a few hours.,4,,"This place is beautiful. And a must if your in Singapore. You can spend as long or as little time there as you want. The views are amazing and a good price, if not free to enter some parts",,
,,Great to explore,5,,This is a free attraction unless you go in the two domes which is amazing. You can spend a lot of time wandering around here and there are pleant6 of shelters if you do get caught in a downpour. The free sound and light show at night is a must see - it took my breath away.,,
,,Excellent gardens and light show,4,,Stayed at MBS and wandered across to the gardens and enjoyed all the colours and different world gardens on show. The skywalk on the towers was a little expensive for what it was but have a great 360 view of all the gardens. Didn't visit the domes as they too were a bit expensive. The light show at night is quite spectacular to music and worth seeing while here.,,
,,Brilliant place,5,,A must if you are in Singapore allow several hours to appreciate it. The forest in the cloud dome is an amazing space and the night light show a must see,,
,,Memorable gardens in Singapore,5,,"Without a doubt, these gardens are not to be missed. I have been several times, and I never grow tired of the gardens. Both the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome are worth their tickets. The orchids in the Cloud Forest are spectacular and represent a very, very wide variety of species and colors. The Flower Dome has changing displays of seasonal flowers and continuing displays of the plant life of different global regions. I went during Chinese New Year, and the Flower Dome was decorated with seasonal displays, most notably scores of red Chinese lanterns. Outside these domes there are plenty of other gardens, fountains, sculpture, and picnic spots. Just plan plenty of time to see the sights.",,
,,Singapore 2019 - Gardens by the Bay,5,,"A must for all visitors to Singapore. The Gardens by the Bay has two main indoor gardens, the Floral Dome and the Cloud Dome. Exotic plants abound and the Cloud dome not to be missed. But the best part is the light show in the evening which is free and choreographed with music, spectacular! Highly recommended.",,
,,A very pleasent way to spend a day in Singapore,5,,"Gardens by the Bay with its Flower Dome, Cloud Dome, Supertree Grove and Skywalk provides a wealth of experiences in close proximity to each other. We found the Cloud Dome to be the most interesting. The light show at night is very good.",,
,,Highlight of Singapore,5,,You must see Gardens by the Bay if you are visiting Singapore. It is close to the cruise ship port and a couple stops using the subway (MRT) Pay the $28 and go through both buildings. They are amazing and very cool in the buildings. Probably about 17 Celsius or around 62 degrees F. The plant life is beautiful and a welcome relief from the heat outside. There is an indoor waterfall and Free High speed WiFi.,,
,,Must see,5,,"Gardens by the bay is a breathtaking botanical garden with some incredible flowers and tropical plants.
There are 2 parts and you can pay $28 per person for both which is definitely worth the money!
It鈥檚 a must see if you鈥檙e in Singapore for even a day!",,
,,"Beautiful garden, marvelous",5,,Beautifully designed and built. Looks and feels fresh and peaceful. Light show was wonderful. Cloud Forest is a must visit inside the garden.,,
,,Beautiful view,5,,Went there with a friends of mine. We both had a amazing time over there. The light show at the end was the best & a must see for everyone.,,
,,Glorious Gardens!,5,,"We'd bought tickets in advance, but didn't realise that these aren't required to roam the extensive outdoor gardens, only for the two indoor domes. Namely the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome conservatories, which are absolutely amazing, and worth visiting at any price! The Gardens by the Bay are a must for any visit to Singapore, particularly at twilight!",,
,,An Awesome spectacle.,5,,"These are amazing. Very impressive and grand. The way they light up in time with the music was very clever. There are two shows on each night. 7:45pm and 8:45pm which are free to view. Make sure you get there about 15 minutes earlier so that you can grab yourself a prime position to view the show. There are however many 鈥渢rees鈥?that light up so you can see at least a few from wherever you are seated. You can also buy a ticket to climb one of the trees and walk along the elevated boardwalk. We didn鈥檛 do this as it wasn鈥檛 as long a walk as we thought it would be.
Looking back at my photos from the night, they came out quite well and it was an awesome spectacle.",,
