,,"Impressive, high end, shopping mall",5.0,,"Living in Dubai, I have seen my fair share of impressive shopping malls and The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands is right up there with the best Dubai (and the world) has to offer.

The design is striking and the location, on Singapore Marina, underneath the iconic Marina Bay Sands Hotel, incredible. The mall even boasts its own indoor canal, complete with boat rides, and mini waterfall, which I found mesmerizing!

Most of the high end brands appear to have outlets. There is a large food court and children’s play area, theatre, casino, night club, an excellent array of quality bars and restaurants, including bread street kitchen and yardbird.

The sort of place you could easily spend quite a few days and huge amount of money!"
,,Wow,5.0,,Its simply wow and it takes a lot of time to cover both inside and outside so do plan accordingly. Great place to be also have a huge foodcourt inside which has a lot of options and cheap compared to other places.
,,Fantastic Mall,5.0,,"Fantastic shopping Mall at Marina Bay Sands. All the top brand name stores plus lots of other shops and restaurants. We spent a whole afternoon wandering around this Mall. Pure luxury and huge area on many floors, so you can get really lost.
Some smaller cafes and even 7/11 for cheaper snack & drinks and there is even a supermarket."
,,You show watch the fountain show there,5.0,,The shopping center is enormous. You can get lost there. You show also watch the fountain show at the sea side. There are two or three shows during the evening.
,,Good,5.0,,"Staying 3nights at MBS hotel and wondering around shopping mall. There are branded shops and lots of restaurants.food court is fantastic as prices are reasonable and good service.
I went to a shop called SPECTACLE HUTChecked for a pair of RAYBAN sunglasses. It’s the same price like in Sri Lanka.for me it’s not a over priced place.
Before you do shopping try to get MBS membership card. As a tourist you will get GST refund and purchasing on points too."
,,Luxury mall,4.0,,"Located in the Business district with a connecting walkway to MBS hotel, this is a luxury shopping mall with international brand names like Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Coach, ... It has a casino, a boat ride, a food court & many restaurants. Not as busy as other malls as it is pricey."
,,Shoppers heaven,5.0,,"Wow. Its literally a heaven for shoppers (females). You got everything from bags, dresses, perfumes, accessories etc. All the world's best brands under one roof. Not cheap but pricey. Good food court and wide variety of food available."
,,Overpriced. Over rated. Ostentatious,3.0,,OMG - a huge range of top brand shops in one complex. Two things in common. Inflated prices and empty. Give me a community market any day. Best and busiest place in the whole centre is the food court - huge array of stores.
,,luxury shopping,4.0,,"Everything here is so luxurious and it is very costly. It has its own station, Bayfront (Downtown Line). From here, it is accessible to few others attractions, such as Garden by the Bay, Flyers, Esplanade, Fullerton and more. Be prepared to walk alot. Worth to visit even if you don’t want to shop at all."
,,Amazing,4.0,,"Wow this shopping centre is amazing. A huge range of shops, designer shops, celebrity restaurants, a waterfall, boat rides and a casino!"
,,Amazing array,5.0,,"Obviously, these are stores under a five star. But you can still find some good deals. The array of stores is amazing and it has the Sampan boat water channel that adds to the over all beauty. Its worth glancing all the stores even if you may not buy anything. All brands. Totally worth it."
,,Good Variety of Stores,5.0,,"If you are looking to shop for high end products, this is the place to be. Probably because of the prices of products, the place tends not be to be crowded. But aside from store, the are a lot of dining choices here from fast food to fine dining restaurants."
,,Fantastic Mall design!,5.0,,"This Shopping Mall is integrated into the Marina Bay Sands hotel. Super modern Shopping Mall, which I can only compare with the Dubai Mall, in Dubai. Four floors, which are located on the most expensive brand shops and many excellent restaurants. There are channels on which boats float.
If you want to buy things of luxury brands, then you direct road here."
,,Vibrant place,4.0,,"A vibrant and cozy place to go,chill out or enjoying the outdoor. This place houses some of the top notch fashion store,some name you dont know exist! It connect with Bayfront mrt station. Overall its a good place to jalan-jalan."
,,Great place to hang out,5.0,,"Greta collection of uber luxury brands and affordable luxury as well. Multiple tiers of ships where you can easily spend a few hours strolling and shopping to your hearts content. The ground floor has a small canal where people can ride a gondola. Honestly I feel that is the cheesiest thing one could do and why people would spend money on this activity is beyond me. However, all other aspects of this place are amazing.

Galleries offer amazing views of the marina. Restaurants in this location are really good and offer a variety of cuisines. There is a huge casino in the complex as well which is a great way to pass your time and have some fun."
,,Huge over the top shopping mall,4.0,,"This place is 4 or 5 levels of deluxe shopping boutiques, designer stores and every other kind of stores you could think of. There are also many restaurants and bars. You could spend many hours and many dollars here easy."
,,Shopping heaven!,5.0,,"If you are a shopaholic, this is the right place for you.
Shop till you drop! Variety of luxury designer's brand to choose from.
Nice ambiance to dine in too. Lots of restaurants, cafe and food-court available.
Make sure to visit Louis Vuitton flagship stores there, besides happily shopping, you can enjoy beautiful river view."
,,Luxury mall with amazing views,5.0,,"The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands is a beautiful and stylish luxury shopping mall with a glass roof and amazing views of the Singapore financial district skyline. It has an excellent food court and you can visit the ArtScience Museum which is right outside the mall, as well as get the most amazing views of Singapore city skyline.

There are some great restaurants here but what we really enjoyed was eating at the food court and enjoying the light display just in front above the round cordoned off area.

We visit Singapore quite often for shopping and sightseeing and use it as a getaway, so we really like to come to this part of the island. With the ArtScience Museum and Gardens by the Bay which are nearby we will continue to visit the Shoppes in the future for shopping and eating and to enjoy the amazing views of Singapore's skyline."
,,Awesome shopping place with amazing experience,5.0,,"A very beautiful place to quench ones thirst of buying luxury brands. Plus a place where shopping is an unique experience. Water fall, boating, science worlds, food, entertainment like night club, casino and lots and lots of things to do. A gateway to paradise"
,,High End,4.0,,"It's difficult to understand people calling it an overpriced mall, the brands are all high designer labels and the pricing is along the expected lines. We shopped at places like Zara and Charles & Keith here. The architecture is something you'd marvel at, there is outdoor area with the views of the skyscrapers and the bay where they organise a light and sound show every evening.

The stand alone restaurants are definitely on the pricier side (Break the bank though for Gordon Ramsey's place, you don't find his restaurants everywhere in Asia). The food court on the lower level bustles with crowds, local and tourists, with places that fit every budget. Had one of our better meals here."
,,Best Mall I Ever Seen,5.0,,this is my first time in Singapore. then I went to the shoppes its just incridible futuristic mall. I love it..
,,High-end shopping at its best,4.0,,"All of the high-end and luxury brands in one place. Even if you are not shopping, you should walk through and admire the architecture and decorations."
,,Excellent food court,4.0,,Great value and a vast choice of food options from dim-sum to curry’s and traditional Chinese food. Great if you want something small and don’t want to pay restaurant prices.
,,Food court is the highlight for the average shopper,3.0,,"The stores are all high end and unless your looking to spend a bit of money the average shopper will only wander around window shopping whilst escaping the heat. However the food court is bustling, vibrant and well priced. Everyone should be able to find something that they would enjoy and its like a Hawker center in the mall."
,,Hit the food court!,5.0,,"The food court had tons of choices! Lots of high end stores which we couldn't afford, lol. It's a great place to seek refuge from the heat. Nicely air conditioned."
,,Great place for window shopping,4.0,,"This is a really huge shopping mall. It's a lovely place with lots of shops and restaurants. However, most of the shops are on the expensive side. Great to just walk around and have a coffee."
,,Amazing to walk through !!,5.0,,"Name a label brand shop and it’s here !!
Every brand you’ve ever heard of and then some more !
Amazing to window shop and the watches are WOW - price tags not for the faint hearted !
Great food court and cute gondola ride available for a bit of fun
Definitely worth a visit if you’re in the area"
,,"Great shopping place, good food!",4.0,,"The area is really nice to discover and walk around. Go and walk amongst all the shops and restaurants, it's worth it!"
,,The mall to beat all malls,5.0,,"You have to walk through the Marina Bay Mall to get to both the Skypark & the Bay of Gardens & you can’t fail to be impressed, anyone who has been to Dubai would compare this with the mall of the Emirates, it really is impressive with every designer store you can imagine being represented.

The layout is good, the A/C a welcome reprieve from the heat & humidity & the various facilities impressive, e.g the w/c are impeccably clean, if you’re in the vicinity do take a look, one of the most impressive I’ve visited, loved the interactive floor below the huge chandelier, children & parents were having a lot of fun!"
,,Amazing mall,5.0,,"Amazing mall, central to everything and it has a ton of great restaurants and shops. It does have almost all luxury brands but it's awesome."
,,Impressive,4.0,,This modern mall is a must visit at least once. It is very impressive with waterways for the gondolas. With exclusive international shops which encloses every brand possible. Nice restaurants.Excellent shopping paradise!
,,WOW what a place,5.0,,"This was our third year in a row visiting here but this place still amazes me. Amazing mall beautiful shops very well organized and maintained. This is a must visit for first timers, my sons love the DC super hero cafe the Digital Light Canvas is a fun experience for the little ones this year we even took the boat ride which was a lot of fun. There is every brand you can think of many restaurants and bars the food court has a lot of options but unfortunately the seating area cannot accommodate everyone because it gets crazy busy during lunch and dinner hours. We watched Spectra The light show from the deck which was a lot fun for the kids even though they had seen it last year too. Basically a visit to Singapore isn't complete without coming here."
,,"Paris, New York, Tokyo.... nothing compared to this Amazing Mall",5.0,,"I've shopped the world over, and NOWHERE (not even Dubai) have encountered a nicer shopping mall - exclusive international shops (the Louis Vuitton Store is especially amazing: with its unique separate building adjacent to the huge main building) and a wonderful blend of local boutiques/favorites. Name a leading luxury brand and they're there. Exquisite, but if you're from the US - seems a bit more expensive than buying at home.... Wonderful restaurants and you can observe the ""action"" on the casino floor through windows above. A wonderful place to walk when the Singapore weather sizzles. Adjacent to the wonderful Marina Bay complex - including the not to be missed Gardens. Not historic (little of the old Singapore exists) - but a must visit spot. Waku Ghin restaurant located here. Especially great place to view the nighttime fireworks from."
,,A must visit shopping center,4.0,,"An impressive shopping center, with all the top class brands, channels with gondols etc, really a mall to visit. Also the water drop on the front of the sea site is impressive."
,,"Amazing mall, a must in Singapore",5.0,,"Amazing mall, a must in Singapore. Both for shopping and enterteinment. All important brands, many boutiques. Wide range of restaurants and food corners. Nice coffee shops. Gondola trips very funny specially for kids."
,,Expensive!,5.0,,Definitely not the place for bargains but absolutely perfect for window shopping. This mall even had a boat ride through the middle of it. We visited the food court on out first night and there was a fantastic range of options.
,,Great Food Hall,4.0,,"If you find yourself in the Marina Bay Area visiting the Singapore Flyer, the Merlin and the Casino then want a place to cool off - go to the shoppes and don’t miss the food hall at the basement level. It’s a busy place but definitely you will not regret going if you are a foodie. Lots of quality food choices. There is also a very nice chandelier and interactive floor for the young ones to play with."
,,"Check out the prestige labels, stay for brunch",5.0,,"I've been to The Shoppes, a few times now and really enjoy visiting here each time I fly into Singapore. There are a number of high-end retailers here with famous fashion labels aplenty. It is also a great spot to have coffee / brunch or just a walk through (check out my YouTube video) to experience the cool ambiance."
,,Platinum card required!,4.0,,"Very high end mall shopping set nicely beneath Marina Sands hotel, a nice visit even if you don’t have a Saudi prince pocketbook!"
,,one of Singapores high class shopping centers,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands shops is one of those shopping centers that needs to be seen to be believed. With all the high class brands like Gucci; Prada; Hugo Boss etc etc. There are multiple floors and many different directions to go and all have shops that ooze luxury. Plenty of Restaurants and eateries and a food court on the very bottom level. Even just to look around is fun. You could probably spend a day looking through all the shops there are to see.
Absolutely incredible and well worth a look."
,,THE PLACE TO BUY HIGH END CLOTHING,4.0,,This mall caters mostly for the very wealthy crowds. All of the stores are of the best of the best all over the world. It is a delight to just stroll and do window shopping
,,Very civilised way to shop,5.0,,"If you want a quieter and more orderly shopping experience vis a vis the busy Orchard Road, the Shoppes is a good option.

Quieter, easier to navigate and close to plenty of bars and restaurants around the bay.

Handy for passengers coming from the new Marina Bay cruise terminal, which we were."
,,An amazing (though potentially costly) experience!,5.0,,"The Shoppes are essentially a collection of the very most ""top-end"" Boutiques, with prices to match. For those of us on a ""normal"" budget they provide an amazing insight into what money can buy, and the entire area is very photogenic, especially the digital fish pond. Once again a ""must experience"" if visiting this Hotel!"
,,On reclaimed land,4.0,,This entire plot of land is reclaimed land. It’s here as the economy of Singapore gets bigger and the government needs to increase the size of the central business district. The area has many famous landmarks as well like the marina bay financial centre which is the latest addition to the number of office towers here in Singapore. Not forgetting the iconic marina bay sands as well.
,,Wow,5.0,,"I just loved the fact that the Hotel where I stayed in had a shopping mall right there.

I used to go there every day for breakfast, lunch, and dinner at their amazing food court.

Walk around their wonderful and neat hallways as I admired the many different stores. From High-end brands to the ones we can afford.

The elegant stores, fantastic service, clean environment of this mall, makes it my favorite mall so far!!

They have very important restaurants from well-known chefs from all around the world.

Thank you for creating such an exquisite place."
,,Great shopping and food,5.0,,Enjoyed walking around in the air conditioning at night. We ate here in the food hall. Nice chicken and rice with broth. The shops are luxury ones. I went ahead of my wife to Michael Kohrs and asked the lady to say they were closing. Unfortunately...she did not.
,,Spectaculus,5.0,,"Crazy! Make sure to visit this place. If you have the money, you can buy something. I guess Dior is one of the cheapest places in there. Only top labels have their boutiques there."
,,Large nakl,4.0,,"The mall is mainly high end shops. Main plus is the A/C which is very welcome when exploring Marina Bay.

There is a food hall on the lower ground floor, reasonable prices. The food hall is beside a huge chandelier hung from the ceiling that sparkles and changes colour.

You can ride on a boat (imagine a gondola without the atmosphere and beautiful scenery) near the middle of the mall, it looks very cheesy and pointless.

The mall is attached to Marina Sands Hotel"
,,Massive,4.0,,"We actually were thinking of staying at Marina Bay Sands and were glad we didn't. It is so huge. The shopping centre is full of every kind of designer label you could think of, so they obviously cater to a select clientelle. The exact reason why we didn't enjoy staying on Orchid Rd years ago. The builing is spectacular."
,,Fantastic Place to Visit,5.0,,"Every time we’ve visited Singapore we have come here for a few hours. There’s tremendous selection of shops, cafes & restaurants. I always visit the food court as there is a great selection of Asian food at very reasonable prices for this area.
Toilet facilities are good and kept in a clean condition.
The shopping mall is kept spotless clean and well air conditioned.
You can access the Marina Bay Gardens from here."
,,MBS,4.0,,"The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands is a really quiet, but with a great and class ambience kind of mall. The stuff on sale is pretty much high class and branded so not really ideal for the normal people visiting. Just make sure to check out the toilet :)"
,,Amazing shopping Centre,5.0,,"This is an amazing HUGE shopping centre, but very expensive as all designer shops. The food court was great and reasonable prices.
They have lights shows outside here every night twice a night. It is really special and awesome sight to see ,a must to wait around for . This centre comes alive at night. The floating Louis Vuitton shop outside is a beautiful looking building and so is the Science centre a stunning looking building looks like a flower.
The view from outside this building is really beautiful at night."
,,Expected moore!,3.0,,"Yes, there are a lot of luxury brands, but the athmosfere is a little forced with a river and boats... Therefore you must, if you want to change side of the mall, go up and down, and up and down again..... much better are other luxury malls in Orchard street, with same brands.
I recomend to relax and have a glass of good vine at the terraze of the hotel Marina by Sands, you have to pay an entrance, but the ticket is also a credit for drink...It is amazing wiev!"
,,Marina Bay Shopping Center,5.0,,"Three floors of elegant shops that you'd find in Paris, Milan, Rome, Florence, London , USA. I counted nearly 20 shoe stores while looking for a pair of shoes. And many restaurant choices when hunger hits."
,,The Mall of all Malls,5.0,,Wow lots of high end stores with great selections and fairly good prices. Beautiful inside this mall
,,What a fantastic Shopping Centre,5.0,,"Well if you want the ultimate shopping experience , this could be it. All the top shops in one place from Armani to Cartier etc. Fantastic fountains and even a Venice type gondola that you can ride on. One floor all eating ."
,,"A great, but expensive shopping mall.",5.0,,"This shopping mall has all the luxury brands, like LV, Gucci, Hermes and so on. It has also middle class brands, and also al lot of dining options."
,,Lovely place for a relaxing day in Singapore,4.0,,On a hot day there is something great about being able to go out on to the waterfront and then back to the air conditioned shops and restaurants. The boats moving around the water moving Singapore around the city is lovely in the evening. Well worth a visit if you are in the city.
,,Shopper's Paradise,5.0,,"space (270 premium luxury shops). It has the first ever floating Louis Vuitton store. Some other stores you can find here include Prada, Miu Miu, Versace, Furla, Valentine, Tory Burch, Dior, Jimmy Choo, Chanel, Givenchy, Kate Spade, Hermes, Gucci, Fendi, Coach, Burberry, Salvatore Ferragamo, VS, RL, MK, D&G, CK, Alexander McQueen, Armani, Hugo Boss, Bottega Veneta, as well as a range of jewelry and watch brands such as Tiffany, Rolex, Audemars Piguet, Rado, Bvlgari, Patek Philippe, Cartier and Chopard. Opening hour: Sun – Thur 10:30am - 11:00pm and Fri – Sat 10:30am - 11:30pm."
,,Lovely views,5.0,,All the eating venues on the front are very expensive but if you want to sit on the front you have to pay a premium price for everything. My advice is have a good walk around here then go one street back for your food then return to the front again for a drink. Lots of places have happy hour where the price of drink is more acceptable
,,"Lots to eat, see, and do",5.0,,"Since we were staying at the hotel we found ourselves at the Shoppes every day, sometimes twice a day, for meals. It is a beautiful place with great restaurants and very high end retail stores. We had fun watching the rain oculus water feature which appears to run every hour on the hour for about 15 minutes. Our kids, ages 8 and 11, had a blast at the Digital Light canvas, which was an incredibly low S$5 for up to an hour of play. Right outside on the bay side, at both ends of the Shoppes, were electric scooter rentals. The adults and kids in our group had a great time scooting around the bay on those. Even if you aren't staying at the hotel, it worth a visit for a great meal, some fun, and the light show on the water at 20:00 and 21:00 daily. The Bayfront MRT stop is at the Shoppes."
,,Great mall with great architecture and facilities,4.0,,Big mall. There are many brands here. Complete for zara store. Sale usually on March. There is waterfall show and venetian boat here. They provides maps for foreigner. You can get Sands card here. Integrated with MRT Bayfront. There is casino for singaporean or foreginer. There is access to garden by the bay from inside.
,,Great Mall with great views!,4.0,,"I thought this mall was one the best I have been too! I liked it better than some of the malls in Dubai! Very well made , architecturally! It also opens out to great views, the art and science museum! It is also connected to the Gardens( Garden by the bay). It has all the luxury brands and the L.V store is stunning! Some great places to eat , although the Din Tai Fung was closed and opening shortly! I loved the mall and ended up going twice!There is also a casino attached to the mall!"
,,Nice mall,4.0,,Definitely a must stop if it’s your first time in Singapore. Part of the MBS complex and with great options for shopping and food. The LV store is definitely one to go inside.
,,Essential visit when in Singapore,4.0,,"If you like to shop, eat or visit a casino then this place is fr you. Lots high end shops,, restaurants cheap and pricey - worth a visity"
,,Disappointed,1.0,,One of the worst Singapore Slings I have had.The best was on the Singapore Airlines Flight over.I was sure they would provide a better drink.Twenty something dollars.better off taking photo and leaving.The Gardens by the bay was awesome.So disappointing to go all the way up for nothing.
,,Food Court,2.0,,"Not too much choice for the vegan traveller. Managed to find a noodle/veg bar. The girl behind the counter realised we were not eating meat or fish and informed us the sauce was fish based, however she used the same tongs for meat and noodles. I think maybe it's going to take some time before the concept is fully understood by some of our Asian friends."
,,Impossible at peak times,1.0,,"The Shoppes property was our biggest frustration during our visit to Singapore. Maddening, but we eventually learned how to avoid the Shoppes side when entering/leaving MBS. The layout and infrastructure is not conducive to large crowds. Choke points at escalators where crowds descending escalators had no outlet but into a crowd.
A horrible experience at the food court. This is where chope culture failed - seas of people carrying around trays of food with no place to sit/eat, while people not eating hogged all the tables. We finally stood and ate inbetween tables after searching for a place to sit for about 30min. Unacceptable."
,,High End Shops,5.0,,"This is an amazing place, everything is so luxurious, not only the brands but the shops, they are wonderful, it is so spacious that is a wonder to go in and do some shopping.

It is connected to the MRT and has it’s own station down the tunnels, it is also connected to the Marina Bay Sands hotel, and there is also another access by foot next to the Botanic Gardens through a bridge, overall it is a great complex, it’s well connected with different exits depending where do you want to access from and it’s so big that it doesnt matter how many people are in, you will not feel it.

It’s definately worth the visit even if you don’t want to shop at all."
,,Nice place for a walk,4.0,,Both the mall n the gardens can get too crowded on weekends n public holidays hence we came weekday to have a look. Aside from the usual shops nothing special about the mall. The landscape is much more pleasant
,,Shops and lights on a warm night,3.0,,"Looks good but in the end is like all the main centres in Singapore,same shops everywhere.Riding the boat through the centre was different and the water feature was amazing. We were there for the light show on the water just outside the centre which was great,not to be missed,also a very safe place to be."
,,Great for window shopping,5.0,,This place is full of high street shops with most of top brands present. Shop if your pocket allows else just roam around and enjoy the ambiance.
,,Marina Bay Shopping Arcade,5.0,,"The shopping area in Marina Bay sands is located at the ground level and basement levels. Accessible using the MRT bayfront station. The shops are aligned with glittering displays, fancy decorations, colorful illumination. The top brands and fashion franchises are the highlight.
The interiors are adorned with colourful decorative items, creating a beautiful visual appeal. A great place to spend sometime while visiting the Marina Bay Sands and skypark attractions."
,,High fashion brands,3.0,,Mall with high brands in fashion world. Prices are not cheap and there are no international fashion chains. The mall itself is very beautiful and worth a visit even if it is not for the shopping.
,,Awesome place with all the World's best high end brands under one roof !!!,5.0,,"The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands is like a huge mall with almost all the world's high end branded shops under one roof !!! Its a lovely place and there are some good options for having meals as well. The place is exactly near the place where there is a laser, sound and water show every evening. We went to this place on the new year eve and had a lovely time shopping and got some good deals as well."
,,Designer,4.0,,"Lots of money required for all the designer shops here! Interesting changing light floor for kids, well worth a walk around the place."
,,Shopping Paradise,5.0,,"Luxury products, branded items .. Come to Marina Bay Shoppes. Enter MBS Hotel or many restaurants to have a meal or have a cuppa of coffee ☕️ to relax..⭐️"
,,A place to experince how a crazy rich asian will do,5.0,,"Aside from shops, they have huge space for you to venture in and around, great food for you to enjoy. Key point - bring your wallet."
,,Food Court/Hawker Centre,4.0,,"Lots of upscale places to spend money in this shopping center, but we especially enjoyed the food court. Think of it as an upscale hawker centre. More expensive, but still a great value and lots of choices in a very clean setting.

Across the street from the resort, so very convenient and a great way to fill your tummy. Couldn't find any chili crab here, tho."
,,Common place,5.0,,I go mbs just to waste time. So many branded store here. You can enjoy high tra and ride gondola. I forgot how much is this but for me its not worth it. Bcs the pool was small
,,A shoppers paradise if you're loaded,4.0,,A breath taking mall to walk through and to do some old fashioned window (pre google) shopping. People hell bent on following the latest fashions will not be disappointed. For the rest of us it is a sight to behold gondolas cruising in a mall. The light show takes place just outside the mall as well and is a must see.
,,Huge designer shops mall,4.0,,Full of designer shops and fun to walk around for window shopping. Next to the food court there is an amazing video that the kids will love as it tracks their movement.
,,A visual treat!!,4.0,,"The marina bay area is anyway a great place to hang around. Upscale shopping malls, tons of photo ops, the aweinspiring skyline - I loved every bits of it. If you are getting only 1 day worth visiting and spending time there."
,,great place,5.0,,"great place for shopping & eat, but maybe a little expensive. But it location very good, at the bottom of the mall there is MRT station"
,,Great mall,5.0,,"A brilliant mall for every type of shopper, spent quite a few hours just browsing and doing some shopping. Wonderful relaxing environment."
,,A Great place to go shopping BUT ?,5.0,,"Great place for shopping the luxury watch section is amazing, the food court section gets very busy on weekends. Some really big flagship stores - the LV store is cool.
A good way to get out of the sun and heat.
Again not the best set up for wheelchairs and prams so we ended up walking abit further than most people. Very clean and safe.
But- As stated in other review the food court can get very busy.
4.5 Stars from me."
,,Shopping mecca and food,5.0,,"This shopping mall is over next to Marina Bay Sands and is an expansive mall comprising many shops, a lot of which are up market, as well as many restaurants and a food hall on the bottom floor which is well worth visiting and trying some of the food that is on offer. At night there is alight and laser show which is a must see."
,,It's got it all,5.0,,"The large selection of shops are a given, but its also surprisingly kid-friendly. Very expansive and easy to stroller around and also provides amenities of things to do, such as the digital light display (should tire your young one out for sure), laser show in the evening, nearby ArtsScience Museum etc."
,,Great for people watching.. near the Gardens..,5.0,,A shopping mecca.. Every possible shop under one roof... Take the escalator up into the roof and explore the stunning views of the Gardens... Better places to eat..
,,Fantastic mall,5.0,,"Fantastic mall, one of the best in the world. Hundreds of shops, water and light show in the evening and every kind of restaurant. Access via MRT."
,,Nice big mall with lots of luxury stores,5.0,,"We came here to window shop but we actually ended up buying a few things. The Louis Vuitton store is pretty impressive; I believe it might be the biggest one on the island. The TWG store is also stocked with any tea you could want. If you can't find what you want on Orchard Road, it might be worth your time to check here.

Along with expensive restaurants, this mall offers a food court where food is affordable. This is the first place we have seen that offers Milo Godzilla. It is Milo DInosaur but with ice cream, totally over the top!

There is a canal through the mall where you can take boat rides like Venice and a water feature that comes on every few hours."
,,Marina Bay shopping centre,4.0,,"All along the Waterfront Promenade a visitor has views of the impressive landmark building of Marina Bay Sands, a chance to visit and see a portion of the interior is to visit the glamourous multi-storey shopping centre and enjoy the air-conditioning. The centre caters for many tastes but we mainly saw very up-market stores perfect for window shopping. The centre is connected to the 'Bayfront' MRT-station. From the top of the building there is pedestrian access above the road to Gardens by the Bay with some good opportunities to take photographs of the gardens."
,,Food court and shopping area,3.0,,"The chicken rice was okay
We also ate tomyum noodle - which was spicy and salty not recommended
A lot of cafe provide good dessert
In here you could find any brands that you need also you could go play casino ( 21 year old above are allowed to go in)"
,,Luxurious shopping & impressive interior,3.0,,"Good place to shop for luxury stuff compare with orcard road. Visit here for few time's but still feel good. During December have a lot of sales. Love their TWG retail shop, you can shop for tea bags, tea pot set or even TWG tea candles. Walking out from the shoppes is a much, the LV flagship side. Nice spot to taking photo and chilling. And you can get Irvins salted egg chip at here. Casino too."
,,Luxurious shopping,5.0,,"Wow, the shoppes are spectacular. Premium brands, so mostly window shopping for us...but this is what makes it cool. You can have a great night out looking at stuff you simply will not find in South Africa, at least not readily available."
,,Lots of luxury,3.0,,"Great shopping option if you are loaded, otherwise it’s a whole lot of window shopping! Little boat through the centre is a nice novelty, light display on one end also, and the promenade here is the place to go to watch the Spectra light show."
,,Impressive interior,3.0,,"While the design of the interior was nice, most businesses in the Shoppes by the Bay were luxury brands and expensive restaurants. The walk through is still a pleasant way to cross over to the Gardens by the Bay."
,,Worst Mall Experience,1.0,,"I’ve been at the MBS many times when I’m in Singapore, and it’s the same old stores, with many stores closed - I believe there isn’t any patrons into the store as I have seen plenty of stores empty for hours every time I went there. It’s really a Potemkin village, and the staff are either invading your privacy - following you around the store or simply doing their own business, which I prefer more. The staff standing outside of the cosmetic stores are very aggressive and pesky, constantly commenting and shoving their products towards by-passers as they are walking in the mall.

Overpriced food and boring environment that makes people feel drained after walking for a short while at the mall. There is seriously some systemic problem with the Singapore culture. Always hectics and rude for no reason. A very exhausting place to be."
,,A luxury to be felt,4.0,,"Marina bay at Promenade is one of the best Luxury that Singapore con offer to the travellers, the high end retails and sophisticated mall give it an ambience."
,,Quality ahops,4.0,,"Well laid out mall. Quality shopping and many of the European and US designer labels here. Bathrooms are well maintained. Good signage to help you navigate the many areas. Very tidy and free wifi available. Very easy to get to on the MRT. Lots to do in the area too — gardens by the bay, sky deck. And if you are into it — a casino. Busy when we were there but able to navigate crowds thanks to layout and wide aisles."
,,Excellent mall !,5.0,,The mall is done-up very tastefully. I thought the LV island store was spectacular. I would definitely rate this mall higher over ION mall on orchard road.
,,Lots of window shopping,4.0,,"This mall only has high end stores and restaurants. Thank goodness for the affordable food court with so many choices. There are three levels of high end stores and 99% of them are empty. Guess where all the people go....yup...the affordable food court.
They should have added a floor of regular stores where the average person can actually afford to buy something."
,,Elegant mall,5.0,,"This is a very elegant mall overlooking Marina bay... It has a lot of fancy brands, and links to a Casino, with many exits to the Marina bay.... There is also a food court at the ground floor. Totally worth a visit!"
,,It is recommended,5.0,,It is not only a shopping mall .. it is an attraction you need to plan to visit .. we enjoy the ride .. we enjoyed the halal food .. the show at 8 was very nice .. the walking area facing the Merlion is very great ..
,,"Excellent food, huge range of choices, complete chaos!",5.0,,"The pretentiously-named title “shoppes” (what on earth were they thinking?) masks the splendour, excess and vast size of a superb shopping mall, right next to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, with its own MRT station (Bayfront) and with easy access to the tremendous attractions around Marina Bay and the Gardens on the Bay.

It also masks a great food court. I can heartily recommend it. Follow the food court signs for the kilometre or so of walking inside the mall, past the boats on the basement canal and the waterfall, and you’ll eventually come to a very large food court, next to a wonderful light sculpture.

This is a gentle but extremely good introduction for we nervous foreigners to the world of hawkers and street food. There would have to be 40-50 small food outlets, just like a street food centre but in a 7 star mall. There is a vast amount of choice from a huge offering of Singapore favourites plus cooking from all parts of China and SE Asia - and even some Western food.

All of it is cooked on the spot and all is delicious. On the two occasions I’ve been there I had excellent noodles, made by hand and with amazing skill to order and then cooked as you watch and served with a range of yummy accompaniments. And I’ve had excellent Shanghainese food / hot and wonderful wonton soup and dumplings made as you wait. All this was simply excellent.

So do go along and eat there. But be prepared for a cut-throat search for a vacant table. It is immensely popular and priced very reasonably. So it is always full.

Enjoy! I am definitely going back!!"
,,Amazing!,5.0,,Lovely shopping mall with its own little river with an awesome open funnel in the centre that catches the monsoon rains when it pours down - amazing! Right next to the Art Science Museum.
,,Shop and eat till you drop,4.0,,"There are a variety of shops over there mostly branded goods such as dior, valentino and gucci. There are also two food courts and superhero cafe for consumers to go to. The chicken cutlet spaghetti from the food court upstairs was a big portion and it tasted good."
,,Huge mall adjacent to the Marina bay hotel,4.0,,This is a huge mall adjacent to the Marina Bay hotel wit a lot of luxury shops and a lot of restaurants as well. Nice place to rest and relax for a little bit after full day of sightseeing.

,,Luxury at its finest,5.0,,"The Shoppes offer an exciting place for the luxury seeker and the haute-couture vulture. With pieces like Montblanc, Chanel, Hublot, Versace, and others, The Shoppes is truly a global marketplace for high-and-mighty."
,,Shop til you drop,5.0,,A plethora of shops and high end stores. Bring your credit card and be prepared to charge. Great shopping experience. Will definitely appreciate the air conditioning.
,,Amazing,5.0,,What a shopping centre. Every shop you can imagine with a food hall that has something for everyone - what about the views back across the marina just fantastic. Connected to the Bayfront MTR directly connected. A must experience.
,,Nothing like it,5.0,,"I've never been to such a place before. The number of shops and restaurants is incredible. The centre itself is amazing. There's a canal running through it, with boat rides you can take. It really is something special"
,,High End shopping,3.0,,"Lots of high end shopping option, the shopping area offers a nice food court area with a really neat digital Koi pound."
,,Part of Singapore 2018 trip,5.0,,"We visited and shopped at the mall,ate dinner and watch the dancing light show.. this mall is big with lots of branded store,a gandola inside the mall,a museum next to the mall ... huge multi level ..food court with international eatery.... this is a must to visit when in Singapore"
,,High end boutiques,4.0,,"This mall is filled with all the different high end international Brand’s, from LV to Gucci to watch Brand’s like Hublot to omega. Not many people and a leisure stroll around the mall. Many different restaurants offering different cuisines around!"
,,"Lavishness ,best dishes to eat from top restaurants, cafes ,and lots of entertainment",5.0,,"It’s huge very huge there are different basements . Entry from MRT too (get down at marina bay sands station) accessible from there
Or from Fullerton/promenade by a 15 min walk
Lots of shops with high end products , restaurants with all the best served dishes for a foodie person , best place to visit"
,,"Great place to shop, eat and keep cool lots of great stuff nearby",4.0,,"This incredible mall features an excellent shopping or window shopping experience. See all the best high fashion boutiques and even the kidswear boutiques. From Baby Dior to D&GKids. There's also a great food court with lots of choice. There's also Michelin Star Restaurants in the mall, and a Din Tai Fong for all your dumpling needs. It is walking distance from the marina bay sands gardens, which has a great water feature playground, flower dome, cloud dome, and Art Science Museum. (don't miss this) There's also a lovely toy shop in the kids area and a chemist near the food court. Convenient MRT station there too. Great for getting around."
,,High End Luxury!,5.0,,Well its a luxury experience. But yes it is worth visiting. At least I liked this place to look around.
,,Expensive but worth a look,4.0,,This is shopping at the high end. An amazing array of shops and huge brand names. Fantastic shopping centre and well worth a look but be warned this is not shopping for those on a budget.
,,A lovely area worth having a look,5.0,,Very interesting hotel complex worth walking through found the shopping mall very nice with great food court lower floor meals around 6 dollars with hundreds to choose from
,,Extravagent and Expensive,4.0,,"If you can afford luxury and designer brands this mall should suit your needs. It's regarded as one of Singapore’s largest luxury shopping malls and described as a mall where you will find ""a refreshing mix of international luxury brands and emerging labels in runway and street style"". We had a browse but none of the shops seemed to cater for an average punter. The food court was busy; a dearth of customers in the restaurants. We enjoyed the cool comfort for perhaps an hour and then taxied to our hotel. Worth visiting when visiting the area."
,,Luxury Shopping,5.0,,"The shoppes at Marina Bay Sands are extremely high end and extremely costly. It is a gorgeous mall but if you do not have deep pockets, window shopping is the best that you can do. Even the food at the food court can be extremely costly too."
,,About the gift shop in the Marina,5.0,,"Joseph Lee served us when we bought a musical box.
He went above his service. He had escorted us to queue for tickets to go up to the viewing deck, gave us a tip to register as a member to receive additional discounts for tickets and how to get discounts for the gift shop. On top of that he added a gift for us. He is such a wonderful help and I hope the Marina recognises him for his hard work for making the guests so welcome to Singapore. Will be back and hope to see you again Joseph !
Love from the Honeymooners !"
,,"Team lab' digital art piece. Shopping mall with luxury brands, retaurants, etc.",4.0,,"As shopping mall as it is. Mostly luxury brands together with restaurants. However, another shoppes like sephora, guardians also available. Apart from cafes and celebrity chef restaurants, food court also there and always crowded. Many shoppes as could be thought of. Casino access. Maybe an idea for first time visiting.

One of Team Lab's digital art also there."
,,SHOPPES OF MARINA BAY SANDS,4.0,,It was a very nice place and shopping mall that people will love to visits. A lot of shops to choose from.
,,An exercise in excess,5.0,,This is one of the shopping malls in Singapore next to the gardens - and is worth a visit just to say that you have seen it. All the major top flight brands are here eager to part you from your cash - there is nothing cheap here but I think it is worth coming to see it. There is also an indoor canal and you can have a gondola trip down to the end where there is an impressive water cascade which your gondolier navigates around.
,,A crass monument to excess consumption,2.0,,"A shopping centre like this leaves me cold. It is where people with more money than sense are separated from the aforementioned cash.

I appreciate that many people love a top end designer shopping centre. But not for me.

The best bit was the food court - lots of tasty food."
,,Good shops all around,5.0,,This is a unique place to visit (as usual in Singapore). Spare sometime here after Garden By the Bay and we will not regret it. or spend your time here in the afternoon before going to GBTB.
,,Unlimited credit card? This is the place for you!,3.0,,If you have unlimited spending money and love high end European designer brands then this is a MUST for you! For us mere mortals we can only dream... strange enough however most are empty
,,Everything you could ask for,5.0,,Marina Bay Shoppes is a great place to visit. It has high end shopping and many great places to eat. You can easily access the metro and gardens by the bay too.
,,Designer shops & huge food court,5.0,,"If you have a limited time and unlimited money to shop every designer brand imaginable this is your shopping mall. If you have money to spare, visit the casino, they will gladly lighten your wallet. If you are hungry and adventurist go to the food court. Gastronomically a fantasyland. At 8:00 & 9:00 pm there is a free 15 min water & light show that is well worth your time. There are many large artist features in the mall - mega chandelier, Water sculptures, gondola ride, fish pond. Lots of delights for the eyes without opening your wallet."
,,The Spectacular Building with Spectacular Light Show,5.0,,"One of the most famous building in Singapore. The mall has anything in it. Food, shops, river, water globe, and my most favourite one is the light show. Don't ever miss it if you visit this place. The show begin at 8pm and 9pm. You can go the show from the upper floor in the building."
,,Wonderful shopping Center,5.0,,"Shopping Center is connected to the Marina Bay Sands and some of us went to the theatre to watch the Lion King and some of us decided to do some shopping.

Plenty of shops - high end designer shops such as Chanel, Louis Vuitton, etc as well as high street brands. Lots of restaurants and a nice food court.

There is also a light show area where kids can get in for SGD5 and play with the lights being projected down like swimming fishes."
,,Snobbish Shoppers’ Nirvana,4.0,,"Modeled after the Venetian concept with indoor gondola rides, this cavernous high-end shopping Centre houses the Sands Casino.

If you belong to the well-heeled club, go here!
Mostly headlined by luxury brands like Chanel, Louis Vuitton and Dior, it stands out with its shopping concierge services.

However, if like me you can only afford high-street brands, there are Zara, Adidas and Charles & Keith to choose from. Otherwise, just go window shopping and people watch.

The shopping Centre spans a few levels. Be prepared to walk till you drop!"
,,"Brilliant all weather venue (air con when hot, covered when wet)",5.0,,"Fantastic indoor shopping, hotel, casino, theatre and museum complex. Shopping is on 3 levels with a Sampan ride ($10SGD each) and an hourly waterfall display (get a coffee Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf to sit and watch) plenty of high end international brand shops and in the evening the Spectra, a free-to-public outdoor light and water show. There is a casino, theatre and museum attached. You can also go to Tower 3 and go up to Ce la vi for fantastic city views. Brilliant all weather venue."
,,Loved it,4.0,,"If you love to shop this is the place to come, all the high end designer brands are hear from Tiffany's to YSL. But be warned with the exchange rate its no cheaper to shop here than London. Just keep an eye out for sales and offers, there are some excellent local brands shops, which sells good valve gifts ect..

But its a great place to window shop and people watch. At the end of the mall there is a huge light show which is worth seeing, as it the water feature which looks like a giant sink.

There are plenty of palace to eat but again shop around for the deals. If you sign up to the Marina Bay Sands Loyalty card there are us good discounts to be had."
,,First-class shopping mall,5.0,,Big and clean shopping mall with many premium fashion brands and top-notch restaurants. This is the shopping mall to go for the finer things in life. Non-Singaporeans get to enter the casino for free as well.
,,Top end mall in Singapore,5.0,,"All the big brand names are here in this multi level mall so if you are one of those big spenders, you can shop till you drop. Those shops as you can tell were not packed with customers so there was no need to fight for your wish list. I trust one of the sources of guests would be those who won big at the casinos in the same complex. There were also many restaurants around as well as a less pricey food court that sold many authentic local cuisines. On the ground level, there was a canal meandering among the shops and you can get a ride on a gondola for a fee. At the time of my visit, it was close to last Christmas and the decoration was beautiful. One tip: if you are taking a cruise on the Singapore rivers which starts from Clark Quay, one would be allowed to alight at a drop off point very close to the front entrance of the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands and thus save yourself some travelling time and cost."
,,Lots of restaurants and high end shops,5.0,,"There is mainly high end shops here, not much affordable shopping but it is still nice to have a walk around. There is a lot of really nice restaurants, I recommend going to the bread street kitchen, the food was fantastic."
,,"Wow, wow, wow",5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands is wow! Shopping is incredible.., just stroll along and take in the whole experience."
,,Designer mall,5.0,,If you like and can afford top brands this is the mall for you. I’ve never seen a mall like this before. However for most people the price tags here are too high. I’ve never been to a mall with so many people in it but so few people in any of the shops. The food court however is very popular and very reasonable as are some of the bars and restaurants. The free light show at night is spectacular and well worth staying for.
,,Expensive designer goods shopping,4.0,,Expensive designer shopping where the staff outnumber the customers. Great for window shopping. But if you have the money you would send someone to buy the items you want.
,,Amazing mall!,5.0,,"Went here a couple of days on the run. Great mall, incredibly clean. Plenty of variety in shops, and a great food court too. Even got a gondola ride and river!"
,,Dumpling heaven,5.0,,"Best dumplings in my opinion in Singapore. Just up from the food court. You have to wait 20 minutes for a table. And that is lunchtime. All dumplings are made in front of you, with a large glass panel showing the kitchen. Everything is absolutely fresh. Not at all over priced for a shopping centre. Well worth queuing up for and waiting. Highly recommend.
Joe
Melbourne."
,,V high end,3.0,,Walked through the mall to see what it was like. It’s v nice but extremely loaded with high end designer brands. So go here if you’re looking to drop bills!
,,Very pricey chic mall,4.0,,I didn't buy anything but it was fun to walk through. It leads to the Gardens by the Bay so you it's worth a walk through just to go there in Air-Conditioning!
,,A hike from MRB and very pricey,4.0,,"Yes lovely building etc. A long hike from MRB just to get to the food court, which is over priced. I noticed the rice and veggie stall was westernised.
All the high end shops were empty of people except the bored looking staff.
A few more mid range shops would make this place more appealing to visit."
,,Shopping,4.0,,Albeit i did not buy anything. .. great to have all shops in one place... light show not as impressive as before... still pricy but quality is quality. Worth a shot
,,Like any other ‘chic’ mall,3.0,,"Beautiful structure of course, neat and modern, offering a wide choice of boutiques, coffee shops etc, but honestly, you can feel it is made for the tourists who come to Singapore to spend their money buying luxury goods.
There is no real live atmosphere there, it is quite an asepticised ambiance.
We did not like the place and did not want to spend a cent there. So many other shopping places with a more authentic spirit in Singapore."
,,"Nice mall, clean and well kept. Mainly designer shopping.",4.0,,"Nice, huge and beautiful well designed mall with mainly designer shops but some high street stores like Zara. Emptyish with very little people actually shopping or buying. Orchard Road is more the place to shop but this is nice to see. Restaurants and coffee shops inside. Connected to the hotel."
,,Very high-end shopping venue,4.0,,The shops at the Marina Bay Sands is located at the bottom of the Sands hotel and connected with the casino. The structural and architectural design of the shopping center is very impressive and almost similar to an airport terminal. I am not a huge shopping person and not familiar with all the luxurious brand names but I am pretty sure they are ALL here. The Spectra light and sound show in the evening is amazing and spectacular. One thing not to miss when you visit.
,,High end brand,5.0,,"If you into high end branded, here is your playground . Went there just for a short strol window shopping . Access via mrt . Close to merlion/ marina bay sand hotel"
,,So many high end shop,5.0,,"I love shopping here.. it's very complete if you like buying high end brand like gucci, dior, LV, prada, etc"
,,High end mostly,4.0,,"Nice shopping centre but mostly aimed at the high end shoppers..
Lowest level has some affordable shops and a food court which is well priced..and a lovely crystal raindrop fountain type of thing.. it’s nice for a place to go after checking out the gardens across the walkway.."
,,Luxury,5.0,,Lots of designer shops (but also a 7 eleven too) and even if you don't want to buy anything it's a great place to walk around. The food court on the lower floor is very reasonable and great quality. There is also a casino inside. There is a cool fountain and also a waterway with gondolas - the whole place has a very 'Vegas'feel to it.
,,filling in time befor oour cruse ship left,3.0,,it is a beautiful shopping centre ever thing is clean and the food at the food court is pricey but of a high quality the shops such as Cartier and rollex so as you have t have a very wallet to shop there but if you enjoy teasing shop keepers
,,Worth multiple visits. More welcoming than expected,5.0,,"I thought this would be a collection of snobby boutiques only for the rich. Sure it's that too but the staff on the boutiques we visited took us seriously and we're happy to chat even if we made it clear we weren't buying. There are shops for the 99% such as Charles and Keith and Adidas as well. Excellent food options at reasonable prices.

The place is also an architectural wonder so do visit even if you never set foot in a store. The evening light show Spectra is worth seeing but be early to get a good space.

Level B2M where most of the watch boutiques are is tricky to find. It's next to the MRT station."
,,Marina Bay Sands Light and Water Show,5.0,,"Inside the Shoppes, other than Casino, there is a lots high end shops, restaurants and food courts.

A indoor river like a small small Venice.

Outside of Marina Bay Sands, a great view of the Marina Bay area.

Night time have the Marina Bay Sands Light and Water Show is one show that you can watch in Singapore every night. The shows start at 8pm and 9.30pm. On Friday and Saturday nights, there is another show at 11pm.
****free-to-public outdoor show****"
,,Family visit,5.0,,"Great range of shops and restaurants, high end shops and food joints. Great place for a window shopping and retail therapy. Beautiful mall."
,,Amazing on first visit,4.0,,"This shopping centre will blow you away on first visit. Been back many times. Plenty of high end shops, restaurants, cafes and bars. Water features, gondolas, and views. Large food court at north end of the basement."
,,Luxurious Shopping Mall,3.0,,"Luxurious shopping mall with many high end shops and a very crowded food court with overpriced meals and very difficult to find a place to sit. Come here only to admire how beautiful it is inside and walk around, but shop and eat elsewhere, unless you are rich of course."
,,Very good shopping mall !!,4.0,,Shopping mall is huge an possibly has every shop you can think of . Most definitely suitable for luxury shoppers but great place to visit 👍
,,Fabulous shopping and awesome food court.,5.0,,"Shops galore to choose from and the food hall would have to be the best I have come across, very busy though so try and get a table before you choose from the extensive choice."
,,Luxury Shopping,4.0,,"This is one place you can accumulate points while making purchases if you sign for the sands rewards membership card which is free. The points accumulated can then be used to offset further purchases. Most boutiques close at 11pm unlike in Orchard road. For cosmetics, Sephora gives customers staying at the Sands Hotel a discount. Bars, Bistros and restaurants are open to late. There is a lasershow, which I believe is aired daily at around 7.30pm. In house there is a manmade water feature which allows water to gush through on an hourly basis. It sends a cool draft in the shopping area, if you are dining at the Beanstro, you can enjoy this while having breakfast, light bites, tea, lunch or dinner. If you are into luxury shopping, this is definitely one place where you can find most prestige brands under one roof."
,,Luxurious shopping mall,5.0,,"One of the best shopping malls I have visited because of its interior and the variety of luxurious shops that are inside!

If you want to go on a shopping spree, this is the place to go to! For kids however, it may be a bit of a hassle because it’s such a big place to go around."
,,Good place to visit,4.0,,"The outside of The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands offered a great view of the Marina Bay area. Inside the Shoppes, you can find many high end shops, restaurants and food courts. Great design and nice place that you should visit during your stay in Singapore."
,,Fireworks,5.0,,"Took a taxi to Level 33 craft brewery bar & restaurant just in time for the fireworks on Saturday night 8pm.

Didn't have time to get a drink and with only craft beers choices were that or wine or soft drinks.

Terrace was pretty packed but a great place to watch and take the views in.

Don't miss this if you can."
,,Its a mall with a unique design,5.0,,Been here a few times. They have a new light crystal chandelier thing where u can control virtually using apps. They have Marvel Event at the science museum. They still have the casino. And hey.... u can win some cash here (not like it used too).
,,High end shops only,2.0,,"I just couldn’t get over the number of high ends shops here. Lots of shoppers walking the mall window shopping but not many actually buying things lol. Think Gucci,prada, LV etc"
,,shopping mall is really good,5.0,,they have some restaurants a casino and lots of shops for shopping but will tell you its a bit expensive
,,Magnificent,4.0,,"The Shoppe is full of expensive, high end, luxury, designer, brand shops. If not for shopping, one can visit this place window shopping. The place screams luxury and elegance.

We actually visited the shopping center to find a place to eat lunch and sit down for a while. However the food court was extremely crowded and it was very tricky to find place to sit down. So, we ended up taking a lazy walk across the mall.

Besides shops there is a small canal (where one can take gondola ride), rain oculus, cafes, food court (ArtScience Museum End) and a digital art installation (which children seem to enjoy a lot).

I recommend you avoid eye contact or small talk with the vendors in the corridor, unless you want to go through an extensive product demo or a sales pitch."
,,glad to see consumerism hasnt died..,5.0,,"theres nothing you cant get here.. even a cheesy gondola ride.. the food court is standard, but if your bored get the folks at Devialet to demo the speakers.."
,,Grand and elegant,4.0,,"This is a huge mall with lots of high end signature shops. There are many food outlets with a International selection of food. There are lots of open space, so the people are scattered and it is not crowded.

The decoration and interior of the building was very grand and elegant."
,,Not the place for a country person,2.0,,"This place is so huge and high end you can't see the top. It is a gigantic marble floored mall with air conditioning which was the best part.
I did not like it in the least with all the wanna be rich pushing and rudely not even providing common courtesy toward us. I was disgusted.
Don't even try to get an overpriced lunch there as you will likely not get a table or even a place to sit.
I will never darken the corridors again."
,,Huge Shoping Place,4.0,,"Well connected to the hotel, casino and MRT with many outlets for shoping. A range of high end shops and restaurants to choose. A great hangout place with friends."
,,Nice area to walk around but too expensive.,3.0,,"If everything you did, ate or bought here was about a third of the price it would be about right. Otherwise a nice area to walk around but unless you're one of the super rich you won't want to buy anything :-)"
,,High end shopping,5.0,,"Hard to find a shopping center this elegant anywhere else. The building may as well be a museum. Beautifully laid out and cleverly lit by natural indirect sunlight. Make it a day as this is a large property.
Food court has a wide variety of places to choose from.
Every store is decorated in such a way it’s hard to resist walking in and taking a look around.
A shopping extravaganza with nothing but the top of the line brands!
If you feel lucky , simply take a stroll into the Casino. Another few steps will get you to the famous Marina Bay Sands hotel.
A must for high end shoppers while in this exquisitely clean Asian country."
,,lots of shopping,4.0,,"came to MBS for a wedding lunch, and whiled my time at the shops after - large selection of luxury goods and other lifestyle items."
,,We went there by mistake but it was a good one.,4.0,,"We got off at wrong MRT station for gardens by the bay, should've used bayfront but walking through this big, wide, spacious mall was an eye opener. Made me feel what we got in Sydney is a joke. The familiar big names didn't impress me, but size of the open space did. The Shoppes has a canal & gondolas, not like one in Venetian hotel in Las Vegas, more like a long pond & boats, still good."
,,Incredible,5.0,,The shoppes at the marina bay sands are incredible there is every kind of shop and designer label you have heard of and lots you haven’t . The air conditioning is just right and makes it pleasant to walk around and browse the amount of shops eagerly awaiting for you to step inside there establishment. Also you can get refreshments from a brilliant selection of cafes / restaurants. After a full day there are plenty of taxis outside waiting to whisk you to your hotel
,,Wow!,5.0,,"I have never been in a mall like this! Very high end, every store is essentially a high end designer store. Think Gucci, Prada, dolce and gabana. There are even kid versions of the same stores. I highly recommend checking it out, it’s certainly fun, even if you can’t afford anything. They have a food court, which is affordable, but no movie theatre. The bottom floor has watch stores, where a Rolex is an entry level watch. It’s a great place to beat the heat!"
,,Nice place to take a walk,4.0,,"It is a nice place with pleasing architecture, lots of expensive shops all around, but very pleasant for a walk."
,,Designer shopping on the water,4.0,,This mall is full of high end retailers that you can find anywhere in the world. I can’t comment on range etc as I don’t buy from these types of shops. The highlight for us was the building itself and the escalator to the entry of the gardens by the bay - felt like we were heading to the clouds. Also provides another wonderful vantage point of the hotel.
,,love this place,5.0,,this are heaven for luxury brand addict. all brand shop on this mall are luxury goods. they have casino in here. really love to see the light show from food court
,,Promenade walk and fountain show,4.0,,"This mall has all the high fashion stores, a casino, and many restaurants. Definitely go to the food court section and enjoy some traditional Singapore dishes. Most importantly walk to the promenade and check out the fountain show at 8 or 10pm while enjoying the beautiful Singapore skyline."
,,Awesome Shopping,5.0,,"We visited the shopping part of the Marina Bay. It is huge, every shop that you can think of, plenty of cafes. Fantastic. Before we left we had light snacks and drinks out on one of the restuarants/bars on the waterfront. A must to look at."
,,One of the best place in Singapore,5.0,,I will say that this is one of the best place i have visited in SG. You can have everything here in all price range you want. You can have a fancy lunch at Sen of Japan or casual brunch at Food Court. You can grab Dior to Bath & Body Works cosmetics. Must visit place!
,,Huge mall,5.0,,"Big mall with a lot of shop , connected to mrt station and casino , great place to visit during the stay in Singapore"
,,Awesome Shopping Mall,4.0,,"This Shopping Mall extends across all the 3 Towers of Marina Bay Sands & has all the high end International Brands..it is easily reached by MRT or Cab... Plenty of Food Court also...if you are a high spending Designer Brand Shopper, this is the place to come to..."
,,Fancy shopping,4.0,,"A lot of high end shops. Pretty to walk around. Coming from the US, I didn't find anything that I couldn't get cheaper in the States. Don't come here for anything local - most were typical designer shops."
,,The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands,5.0,,"For your average person, a place more just to walk around and take a few pictures. Pretty much every designer label has a shop here and all very expensive as would be expected. A canal runs through the shopping mall on which a little boat trip can be taken!"
,,Jaw-dropping,5.0,,"I'm not easily awed by malls, coming from mall-crazy Manila, But my jaws dropped upon entering The Shoppes. Not so much for the size of it, but for the luxury of everything under -- the brands, the finishes, the quality of the restaurants, and the space. Not only did it stretch from end to end of the 3 towers of the Manila Bay Sands, but it also didn't scrimp on the vertical space. I think there were only 3 levels of shopping, but the glass ceiling probably extended higher than those 3 levels stacked together. And a display of Christian Louboutin shoes, each pair encased in glass, running along the middle of an entire shopping hall, on stands above a water feature. How artsy is that? Paradise for designer brand shoppers."
,,High-end shopping heaven,5.0,,"Packed full of designer brands and labels, ranging from Gucci to Prada, Balmain to Chanel, this mall opposite Marina Bay Sands has the lot. If you’re a shopaholic, then you’ll absolutely love this place. Sleek, modern and totally fabulous throughout, The Shoppes will have you here for hours. Totally in-keeping with the contemporary look and feel Marina Bay Sands and the near facilities offer.
There is even a small river running through the centre of the mall where you can boat up and down!"
,,"Expensive, breath taking.",5.0,,"How come they can make such huge malls, how come the make it breath taking with glamour, how come they are well maintained, how come they are always crowded and how come they are so expensive?"
,,Shopaholic Paradise,5.0,,"This is one of the most upmarket shopping malls you can find. Almost every designer label you can think of and more plus loads of restaurants.
Worth a walk around and if you want to buy then come with deep pockets!
Restaurant choice is great with many celebrity chefs. These are more affordable than most of the shops."
,,Wonderful Mall,5.0,,"Its a must visit place those who travels first time in Singapore. The mall is directly connected to MRT station. The mall is full of wonder. When I first reached the mall from MRT corridor I just told WoW.... I amazingly saw there is a indoor lake in the mall and there are some boats are cursing around there. And the Lake is not only indoor lake is directly connected to the river.
The Mall is a connecting hub to the River, The museum the hotel and the Gardens by the bay.
Its a High end Shopping mall. All world class brand shops are available there."
,,A lot of movements,4.0,,"The direct access from Marina Bay Sands, from the MRT, the harbour makes it quite easy to enter the building. You have all kind of food courts, possiblities to shop either clothes, shoes and everything your heart is willing to pay for. The mall is simply great and a must-have place to be seen, when you travel the first time to Singapore."
,,"THE PLACE TO SHOP, EAT AND PLAY TILL YOU DROP",5.0,,"This place is humongous with every single branded available here. OMG all in one place with the iconic LV “Museum Like” entrance tunnel to the fabulous architecture.
Museums, Singapore River Waterfront, Cafes and Restaurants that caters to everyone, this place is such a cool place to be in. Tried quite a few F&B outlets. FABULOUSIOUS."
,,Absolutely Astonishing,5.0,,This mall has every designer shop under one roof! A must see for every shopaholic and fashionista. Even if it’s to see rather than shop this place is worth a visit
,,Large Mall typical high end stores,3.0,,Nothing special except it is attached to the hotel and the casino. Some celebrity chef restaurants & name brand stores.
,,Best place of Zara stores,5.0,,"Best place for shoppers. There areamu branded store inside, bag, blouse, restaurant, shoes, kids apparel. Wow.. If you search Zara, you can get best model inside. No other Zara stores in Singapore like this. It's very complete."
,,Beautiful Mall!,5.0,,The mall is beautiful and expensive. The food court is excellent. We had dinner at the underground food court. The spectra offers excellent light show for free at 8 pm and 9 pm. The water whirlpool at the entrance is amazing. The Bayfront MRT is nearby. The architecture is amazing. The bay views are wonderful.
,,High end Shopping Mall,5.0,,"Wow, this is a place you need to have money when shopping. Shops are high end with high prices. Good spot to go Md look at but make sure you take the credit cards from your wife before you go in lol.

The food court down the far end had cheap food and a good variety to choose from."
,,Great food options,4.0,,"Had breakfast here every day during our stay at Marina Bay Sands. Starbucks for $25 compared to $90 for two in the hotel. Beanstro was also good for breakfast but didn’t open until 8.00am. Bread Street Kitchen by Gordon Ramsay, db Bistro & Oyster Bar by Daniel Boulud and DC Comics Super Heroes Cafe were also great. Shops themselves were all high end so not much for us there but we did use the 7Eleven, Cold Storage and Sports Hut."
,,Favourite Luxury Shopping Mall,5.0,,"One of my usual place in Singapore when comes to luxury shopping. Depending on brands, most sales period take place in End May - Mid June (Mid year sales) and End Nov - End Dec (Year end sales). The Shoppes has 3 tiers for their membership, you could find out more from MBS official website or drop by at their Customer Service counters. However do note certain tenants/big brands do not join The Shoppe rebates program, such as Hermes. The points are validity for one year only.

There are tons of ATMs machine available at the basement level, especially at most of the Casino entrances.

Very much enjoyed my shopping experience here as compared to Orchard Road as most of the luxury brands gathered under one mall. Location is easily accessible (MRT located at the basement, Bus, Taxi stops at every tower)."
,,Luxury mall,4.0,,"Shoppes is a Luxury mall, might not be the best place for a budget traveller but nevertheless it's a must see. We covered it while going from Helix bridge to Gardens by the bay, however the way from inside the mall was closed.
We could see a lot of shops, but due to limited time couldn't cover entire place."
,,Shopping Mall,4.0,,"This is a beautifully architected shopping mall and worth a look, even if you are not intending to shop. It is full of high-end shops and set in the classy Marina Bay Sands."
,,Great place to Browse,4.0,,Visited this shopping mall on our way to see the Skypark and we're most impressed with the mall. You can even take a boat ride in the centre. The upside down fountain was very impressive as was the light attraction near the food court. Most of the retail shops were high end and expensive but the eateries are quite reasonably priced. There are lots of flowers on display...and the whole mall was spotless. I could easily spend the day here browsing.
,,High-end but too pricy for the British tourist,4.0,,"These shops/shoppes? certainly look the part but they are expensive beyond belief, mainly because of the exchange rate between the mighty Singapore dollar and the (by comparison) puny British pound,"
,,Great mall,4.0,,"The shopping mall has a great mix of shops and eateries, easy access via MBS or MRT. Lots of high end shops, all possible luxury brands are represented, plus celebrity chef outlets and also some regular shops. Location is just perfect as one can also go outside and enjoy a spectacular view of Singapore."
,,Fantastic Mall!,5.0,,"Hi we walked through 'The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands' on our way to the 'Skypark' The mall or resort is huge, every shop, restaurant (in fact seven celebrity chef restaurants) you could imagine. Very impressive. You could easily get lost if it wasn't for the very helpful customer services. On our way through we saw boats on a lake & beautiful fountains. Everyone we met was very friendly, extremely polite & helpful. would recommend."
,,an amazing place well designed well worth a visit train station underneath,4.0,,well worth the visit amazing building with casino and train station as part of the building would and will visit again
,,The gondola and waterfall are worth seeing,4.0,,Very high end shops at this shopping mall. There’s also middle of the range and a food court. The best part of it was the gondola ride at the bottom of the mall and a waterfall coming out of a dish at the end of the canal. Worth seeing.
,,"Not special enough, really",3.0,,"This shopping mall is not stylish enough to be considered of international level. International brands are there, also the big names (Hermes, Salvatore Ferragamo, Brunello Cucinelli, Gucci, Prada, Cartier, etc, but we have seen so much better in Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, but also Istanbul, for instance. It's a bit of a ""cold"" place, entering it from the harbor side is like entering a railway station and some stores are just in a quaint place (Church's, Boggi, for instance). So the architecture is not so good, the food places average (in general). No, it lacks a lot. Raffles City was worse, so does this city have any good shopping places to offer ? Not sure."
,,A must visit place when coming to Singapore,5.0,,"Strolling to the Marina Bay, seeing the famous tourists spots, at a side here is located a Mall if thats what is really called. A wide and beautiful place to stroll or buy some items. With beautiful architecture, sure this place is packed with people. Shops are organized and most personnels are nice and accomodating. Here is also located a Venice water way like area where clear waters are and a boat where you can ride. Nice and comfortable place. For a typical tourist, it may seem that the prices in the shoppes are costly."
,,High end shopping...experience,5.0,,"The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands are fantastic, every high end brand you would ever want to shop at. Beautiful easy to navigate and even has a boat ride on the lowest floor...nice little experience. The Casino is also located off of the Shoppes...so if you didn’t spend all of your money shopping... Casino Time."
,,Beware of samples,2.0,,High end mall with lots of designer stuff. Beware of sales people handing out samples. They will force you to buy their product if you get one.
,,Top 3,4.0,,"Besides Ion and ngee ann city in orchard, this is 1 of the top 3 malls in singapore. Has everything from mass market to high end luxury

Food wise, the range is also great, including a few michelin restaurants

Also a concert hall for events and the art science museum is connected next door"

,,Crazy and Expensive Mall,4.0,,"We didn't know what to expect but when we went for dinner at the food court, there was no where to sit and it was crazy. All the other restaurants that we found were so out of our price range that we ended up having to leave. It was unfortunate that we couldn't make this place work for us the first time we went. We came back today for the same food court and were able to find a table. The variety is great and the food is wonderful. Not Hawker Stalls but still good. The rest of the mall is full of overly expensive stores out of most people's price ranges but they are fun to window shop."
,,High ends shopping mall,5.0,,Well known and great brands are here. Restaurants and supermarket are also available. Beauty boutique such as sephora are also in here. Family will enjoy.
,,A weekend enjoying luxury,4.0,,"We went just last weekend with friends and children and really nice to see how they keep the place well maintained. We liked hem for the large restaurant variety that you find together with the shopping option.

,,The most gorgeous shopping mall!,5.0,,"Wow, is all I can say about this shopping experience. The shops are gorgeous, but the mall in which they are housed is absolutely stunning. The shops are for the most part very high end, so I'm not sure if most of the visitors were shopping or enjoying the spectacular of the venue. Please see the attached photos as words cannot describe!"
,,A great place to spend the day,5.0,,"This is a place on steroid. It has everything. From high end shops to foodie restaurant, to a place to rejuvenate, to exercise and just about to do a lot of activities. Not a place to miss when in Singapore."
,,Luxury! Luxury!,4.0,,"Plenty of high end luxury shops and great places to eat. Most of the very expensive shops were empty not many people buying surprisingly A few more ‘high street’ shops on the ground floor. Has a ‘canal’ running through it with ‘gondolas’ thought this was a bit tacky/ touristy for such a nice area.
Enjoyed our visit."
,,Another mind blowing place,5.0,,"Called in after the laser show , couldn't believe it. Absolutely huge selection of shops , have to say very few buying , all the top brands. Had a delicious curry in the food court which was very cheap"
,,Marvellous Marina Bay,5.0,,"What a place to visit , such a huge shopping mall , so many high end shops to see. Many eating places too but very busy as we visited during Chinese New Year ! Saw the fireworks and laser show at night then walked back along the promenade. Revisited the next day after seeing gardens on the bay. Well worth a visit when in the city."
,,Come here!,5.0,,It is an impressive building and of course window shopping is always fun. Go late afternoon and you can squeeze in a whole raft of things including dinner.
,,Must Visit When In Singapore,5.0,,"Everything Luxury in Singapore is packed inside this place. Attached to the famous Marina Bay Sands Hotel, all the signature brands of bags, shoes, clothing are here. Even high class, fine dining restaurants are here. When in Singapore, visit this place and if you have extra budget, try checking in to MBS. :)"
,,Excellent shoppe for high end goods and restaurant,5.0,,Been to Marina Bay Sand Shopping a few times and it is still one of the best places in Singapore to shop for luxury goods and have a good meal at many choices of restaurants within this shopping complex.

,,Window Shopping!,4.0,,"No trip to Singapore would be complete without visiting the Marina Bay Sands precinct. The shopping centre is worth a walk around, if only for some window shopping and relief from the heat outside. But also plenty of people watching to do. We visited prior to Christmas and they also had an offer to sign up to their rewards program and get a free gift! Free wi-fi available, plenty of options to get something to eat and also a gateway across to the Gardens by the Bay, or chance to go outside in the early evening to see the free laser light show.

Worth the visit if in Singapore..."
,,A nice place to walk around but needs a big wallet,3.0,,"A nice place to visit and walk around. But unless you have a big wallet, you won’t be able to buy anything. Ridiculously priced. Meant for the richest!"
,,Great Shopping Mall,5.0,,"I always come here whenever I visited Singapore. The shopping mall have everything from branded product, food court to entertainment so I don't have to go anywhere else. Although it's a high end shopping mall but sometimes if they have special offered on the branded bag can be worth it to buy. I like the location of this shopping mall also because there are a lot of things to see in Marina Bay."
,,BIG HIGH END MALL,4.0,,"I love the concept of this mall! Especially the river inside! U can ride gondola to see the entire mall~ they have ice skating rink, marvels cafe, big food court that have si many food options! I stayed till very late 9/10 pm(?) and they still open! This is one thing i like about sg everybody seems to enjoy their time till late at night and nothing seems to close XDD the only downside tho it can get pretty crowded in some area like the food court filled with kids running around coz its located right next to the skating rink"
,,Shoppers Dream,5.0,,"Excellent place to go shopping - Spotlessly Clean and an ideal place to find gifts to take home, window shop or just to indulge yourself. Good food court -"
,,Touristic mall,4.0,,"I visited this mall for quick shopping to shop at my favorite store.
The brand owns some more outlets in other locations, but I prefer one in Marina Bay Sands because it is less crowded.

The mall is huge and clean. It houses so many high end brand stores. The mall has more touristic taste than others and the facilities are clean. It is very accesible with direct connection with the subway station.

For tourists, this place can be a good attraction."
,,fabulous views,5.0,,"this is a great area to roam and take pictures of the unique Singapore architecture. There are also shops, museums and restaurants and a great food court."
,,Marina Bay Sands,4.0,,These are shops within the Hotel premises and as all Hotel shops they are at the higher end of costing .. Just took a stroll .. but there were some good brands too ..
,,Fancy Mall with Fancy Shops,5.0,,One of the best mall of Singapore. A must visit. It is massive. It has All the fancy Shops from around world.. Very close from Bayfront MRT.
,,Like the Design which is well connected,5.0,,"You could be lost in this mall as they are connected to a few places which I unable to name. Upper floor is more to premium stores while lower will be the normal with food court, common brands, and a child play area with lights.

Like the services over here"
,,High end shopping,3.0,,"Mainly high end shopping for the guests at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel over the road and the casino within.
A good variety of restaurants to choose from.
Close to the Arts and Science Museum and Gardens by the Bay.
An MRT station is within and there are plenty of taxis at the large taxi rank.
Accessibility: Multi-levelled with plenty of access through escalators and elevators.
Price: Free to enter.
Toilets: Very clean."
,,Its a must.,5.0,,"If you are visiting Singapore you really should go to Marina bay, it is quite stunning and the shopping if that is your thing is endless, from high end to very high end luxury goods as well as affordable. Take a trip up tower three to Ce la vie and have a drink with a view."
,,Convenient mall to The Marina Bay Sands Hotel,5.0,,"Stayed at the Marina Bay Sands hotel and it was very convenient to have this beautiful upscale mall within walking distance inside the hotel. Connected indoors, all you need to do is pass through some escalators and within minutes from the hotel lobby , you are at this beautiful mall. It’s quite a big mall with higher end shops and a few restaurants and a casino within the area as well. A shopping addicts dream , there are designer stores , jewelry and watch stores, and also middle range brand stores as well. The mall is very clean and well maintained . The SMRT station is also within the vicinity accessible indoors through the marina bay sands hotel . A must see mall if you want to do some serious shopping or just simply window shop. The mall has an elegant feel to it."
,,"Frivolous, fanciful and self indulgent",3.0,,"So it is the Shoppes rather than a Mall, does this qualify it to be a little exclusive ( read expensive) ?
Luxury shopping experience close to the giant Marina Bay Hotel, almost all of it high end stores, although when we visited , it was their less celebrated cousins and the chain restaurants that were doing all the business.
This very large mall over 3 stories high and 3 football fields long, is open from 10.30 - 23.30 - who actually goes shopping for expensive watches after 11.00pm ?
Frivolous, fanciful and self indulgent, a wonderland for those who are burdened by just too much money."
,,"Magnificent place for shopping, food and entertainment",5.0,,We spent time here for shopping food and drinks. There were lots of shops and fountains dancing show at night at the Bay. There's more things to do and see around.
,,Just another high end shopping mall,2.0,,"Everything is expensive in this mall. Even the coffee at starbucks cost $5 (singapore) here.

Overall, I feel that Singapore is just a tourist trap. Now back in USA, I just don't remember anything memorable there. Crowded dirty MBS infinity pool with narcissistic people taking endless selfies, and shops & restaurants with unreasonably expensive price tags.

I probably won't go back to Singapore as a vacation destination."
,,Great day in Sentosa island,5.0,,"Great shopping and close to the marina, you can also get the monorail to Sentosa island which have everything to have a great day"
,,Something a little different.,4.0,,"This is one of the high end malls in Singapore. There are all the top end fashion names here, as well as top jewellers and some fancy places to eat. It is quite long and is larger than it looks. There is also a small canal in the middle with short boat rides.
It is a very good place to hang out on New Year’s Eve or just to get out of the weather for a bit."
,,Must Visit Place In Singapore,4.0,,"Huge shopping mall,next to Marina Bay Sands hotel ,connect to MRT,must visit place in Singapore,Most of branded luxurious are here,good for window shopping,. The food court have lots of choices, but price a bit high"
,,Luxurious shopping mall,4.0,,"This mall is suitable for people who really want to buy branded luxurious items. Brands such as Rolex, Gucci, Ferrari and many more are seen here. The mall have a good location which is situated nearby Marina Bay Hotel and Bay front MRT. The mall is also a throw away to the Spectra Water light show which shows beautiful water lighting display at 8 pm.

At that time of my visit, it was a few days after Christmas and there are still Christmas decorations and lights still seen at this mall."
,,Great place,5.0,,I would prefer to shop here than the busy town with many people. Here I found peace and calm to shop. Especially when you are indecisive person. I shop a few of bags and rest having a cup of tea that really calms the mind.
,,Window-shopping...,4.0,,"For most of us mere mortals, The Shoppes will be strictly a window-shopping experience, but certainly worth visiting even if you're not a shopper but would like to see for yourself this temple to opulence and affluence which is part of the hotel and casino complex.
Have not seen too many customers actually shopping... most of the top-shelf designer brand shops looked empty.
I also wonder who came up with the pretentious name of ""The Shoppes"" - the mall has absolutely nothing in common with English ""Ye Olde Shoppes""..."
,,Mall next to Marina Bay Sand Hotel,4.0,,"This huge Mall is right next to Marina Bay Sand Hotel. You can have access directly from the hotel.

The mall has mostly high end shops with a variety of restaurants, very reasonable food court and a food shop too.

They also have small store of Hamleys for the kids in this mall.

A little boat ride is also running through the mall, good for younger kids"
,,Excellent Location in Singapore,5.0,,"Never felt bored in visiting this place and time can be passed just roaming this place. Window shopping, Laser Show, Casino makes you to visit this place again and again."
,,A 5 -star shopping experience,5.0,,"We came here twice during our short visit to Singapore. This is the best place to shop for all designer items as almost all the major and premium brands are well-represented. I had an especially memorable experience shopping at the Hermes boutique as their customer service is definitely better than their counterparts elsewhere in the city. The SA actually gave me some advice & pointers on how I could get my hands on some of their well-sought after bags. Needless to say, I got my dream handbag from this particular store after making 2 trips there on successive days. ( that’s how hard it is to get an Hermes bag ... and mind you, it’s not even a Kelly or a Birkin!!). So, yes ...if you think of shopping for high-end products, do come to Marina Bay Sands as I’m sure the other boutiques will also offer similar excellent services"
,,Shopping and Hangout Paradise,5.0,,"Shows....shopping,....sky decks....restaurants...food courts...all the major brands...interconnected aisles with all the surrounding attraction."
,,Mall by Marina Bay Sands Hotel,3.0,,"This mall is next to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and so it is very comfortable to get there if you stay at the mentioned Hotel. You can find all kind of Brands and Designers in there. The price is higher than somewhere else but you have them all at one spot.
The forecourt is good and comparable ok in pricing. We had two times diner at the foodcourt. Indian and Japansese food. Both were good.
Also mentionable is the grocery store in the mall. There you can get water and sodas etc for much better pricing than around this close area.
All in all it is a typical mall with no super special highlights."
,,Great Mall,5.0,,"If you are into the finer things in life, you should shop here. MRT takes you right there, there is a Casino, and if you stay at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Wi-Fi works everywhere inside the mall. Food is over priced though. I would go to the Hawker Centres inside the city."
,,Great for wondering around but not really for shopping (too expensive),4.0,,"Went to the ArtScience museum on October and decided to visit here as well with my friends. We were just from the museum and since we're pretty much idle, we went for a walk around the mall. They're more on the expensive luxurious brands compared to VivoCity but it was a good place to just have a look around.

PS.

The food here are expensive. I wouldn't really want to spend my money on food here unless you're very hungry and cannot wait to get somewhere else to eat."
,,Big Luxury Mall of Singapore,4.0,,"They Say that vivo city is the Biggest but i feel this is even bigger. I got to tired to see this place .. Its filled with lots & Lots of Big Brands from restuarants, Clothings, Fashion Etc. Great Ambience"
,,Super Luxurious shopping mall,5.0,,"Best of the best luxury brands have a store at this fabulous shopping malls.
High Class shopping place. You get the best of brands here in Shoppes. LV has a special store towards the Bayfront.
This place has an open track for walking, jogging etc. Nice place to come for shopping and food.
The water canal in the middle is very cool to try out. Lots of restaurants here to enjoy good food."
,,Luxury Mall,5.0,,"The Shoppes is a world class mall, like any other signature buildings in Singapore. The design itself is outstanding, the interior is awesome and you can even see the artificial gondola ride in ground floor. This is a suitable place if you like to shop the high end brands from around the world or just chillin around. Nice view."
,,Must do,3.0,,"If you are in Singapore its just one of those places you need to go too, to tick off the list. It is an impressive shopping centre with high end shops and top restaurants.
Personally i'm not into this when i travel but i can see how it could be an exciting hub for the shopaholic.
If you are not wanting to spend over $200 in a high end restaurant the food court is also a nicer one with high end authentic cuisine where you could have a bite to eat in between shopping."
,,Marina Bay Mall.,5.0,,Must go to Marina bay mall you can find boat inside the mall very beautifully designed mall very much different from other mall and you can find luxury brands here for shopping.
,,High end,3.0,,Wow talk about high end Don’t come here if your on a budget unless it’s just to window shop and dream Food court is totally over priced and shops are extravagant to say the least. If your after designer then go crazy
,,Just Another Mall,3.0,,I really did not see anything special here. It’s no different than any of the other high end malls in the United States. The food court offers lots of choices. Grabbed a quick lunch at a Japanese stand then walked on over to the SkyPark.
,,Shoppers paradise,5.0,,"This is a must see for any serious shopper,great designer shops along with many celebrity dining establishments."
,,Coolzzz,5.0,,This is one of the best place to visit while you're in Singapore. You will see so many tourists out there. Good place for shopping.
,,High end mall - a sight to see!,5.0,,"This mall is amazing. I'm not sure who actually shops here, but they must have major $$ to spend. All the highest end stores and restaurants are here. We only ate at some of the restaurants and did a little shopping at a few of the more normal stores. Finishes are amazing - marble, stone, wood and glass. The skylights and glass areas are amazing. There is an indoor ""river"" with gondola rides. There is an inverted dome fountain made of glass. There is a large convention center attached. There is also a food court. (hawker style center). The Shoppes are connected to the Marina Bay Sands via under ground (beautiful) corridors and escalators. There is a also a bridge connection up near the roof (accessible via elevator from the Shoppes. We enjoyed all our meals here at: Carnivore, Pizzaria Mozza, the Bird and the Superhero Cafe. it's also a great place to grab some A/C and look around. At night, there is a great light show on the bay, just outside the Shoppes area."
,,Could Be Anywhere,3.0,,"If all you want is designer labels, which you can get anywhere, then you will love this mall. If you are looking for something unique or original don’t come here."
,,Iconic landmark of Singapore,5.0,,"We didn't stay at the hotel so didn't get to the see the pool up in the sky. We strolled around the mall and the kids went ""fake"" ice skating at the rink. Great place to stop by rest to get out of the heat. The AC gets a bit too cold I noticed in the malls of Singapore so not a bad idea to bring a sweater."
,,Branded Shopping Mall,5.0,,Things sold here are of high end stuff......do not expect cheap things here. The mall is very classy and beautifully decorated too. It is very convenient and there is a MRT station (Bayfront) being attached to this mall. Be prepared to splurge if you want to shop here. Shop at your own peril!!!
,,Visit with other attractions,4.0,,"This shopping mall is full of seriously glitzy stores so few of us will buy much. But it is an impressive building and of course window shopping is always fun. The food court in the basement is considerably more accessible price-wise with a vast array of local cuisines. While I wouldn't suggest visiting this shopping area as a stand-alone attraction it's a nice add-on to the Marina Bay Sands Skypark, the nightly laser show just outside, and the boardwalk. Go late afternoon and you can squeeze in a whole raft of things including dinner. You can get cabs to and from the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and make a great evening of the whole area."
,,High End,4.0,,"Like the title says, this mall is VERY high end. There was a good food court with a good selection to choose from. We were staying at MBS, so it was nice if we wanted to go for a walk or grab something to eat. I think it may still be under construction, but still nice"
,,High-end Attraction,5.0,,This is a beautiful place for a stroll with Family and Friends. Shops are extremely trendy and expensive. there is a Casino as well however you must take your passport if you are interested to go into the casino. Just a walk inside this area as it's a main attraction. We were not that much into shopping as our stay was very short. ensure you take a taxi and do not get caught to private transport as taxi's are still very reasonable to get back to the hotel.
,,Good Variety of Stores,4.0,,The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands was a great place to eat-many varieties of food were offered.There was great many stores-many were quite expensive but fun to look at!!
,,Amazing shops and restaurants.,5.0,,"Spent days looking at these shops, stopping for food, buying lots of amazing things.It took five days to work out where everything was and remember how to get to everything.
The Miow Miow fresh yoghurt shop was unbelivable. Not sure how to spell it but just next to the amazing food court."
,,Very posh and definetly worth a window shop.,3.0,,"Place was just over the helix bridge which makes a nice walk at night, but once your in the place is very hard to navigate. No bargains to be found and at all but is for a very high end consumer. Saving grace did like the restaurant on the ground floor and the super hero café was an interesting browse. Bars and restaurants on the upper fringe are also a nice experience at night."
,,High end shops,4.0,,"Great place to shop but bring your credit card, most of the shops are top end stores. Plenty of places to eat as well with food court or celebrity chef restaurants. Catch the laser light show at night or visit the casino. Easily accessed via the MRT."
,,The shoppes. Branded stuffs that all.,3.0,,The shoppes under MBS. Mostly branded stuffs. And branded restaurants of course. Link by bayfront MRT.
,,A mall worth visiting for high end shopping,5.0,,"With closing hour later than most mall in Singapore, it is a good place to shop for luxury goods and fine dining! From high end French labels to mainstream street wears, the mall offers a variety for everyone. The mall also has a massive convention hall, a five star hotel and musuem within its space.
Worthy brand to visit will be LV which it’s boutique is a small”island” away from the main building!
Close proximity to Gardens by the Bay and also the Marina Bay n Civic Square n Merlion, strolling here especially in the late evening is exceptional nice to capture the different angles and views of the CBD.
Definitely Instagram worthy!"
,,Like 5th Avenue Indoors,4.0,,"Stores are almost exclusively high-end, but there is a pharmacy that sells a lot of Tiger Balm products.

It is worth it to buy Asian and some European brands as they are cheaper or on par here with North America (at least Canada). There is a pleats please, bao bao, and an MSGM which were quite good. Unlike Japan, some stores also have large sizes and shoe sizes that go up to a women's size 10 US. You can also get your tax refunded upon departure from Changi airport.

The sales associates generally don't seem that interested in helping though, so the shopping experience is not the best. I went to one store twice. I walked out the first time because of the lack of assistance. I went back later and had excellent service.

The Halal food court had some surprisingly decent local food. It is about $4 SGD more on average than the food court at ION Orchard, but good and my meal was $12 SGD for a beef rendang and a drink. The top level has Gordon Ramsay restaurants and others that seem to offer non-Asian offerings.

On the same level or perhaps the second level, there is supermarket that sells Kaya jam and some specialty food items that make great souvenirs.

Outside of the mall are most of Singapore's land marks. Very much worth it to walk around the exterior of the mall and take pictures.

It was also a great place to catch a glimpse of the F1 race."
,,Shop till you drop,5.0,,High end shopping mall (though you can also find shops like Banana Republic and Club Monaco) next to the iconic Marina Bay Sands hotel. This shopping mall is huge and comes with a Venice-ish canal.
,,Stunning area,4.0,,"Visited the Marina Bay Shopping Complex - we used the MRT - station very convenient. Beautiful shops, mostly designer shops, but it was lovely ""window"" shopping - their window displays are amazing. Had a meal in the ""Food Market"" which was good - such a variety of different cuisines to choose from. Watched the Laser Light Show from the deck of the shopping centre, which was an amazing experience."
,,A must walk around,4.0,,A must walk around place in Singapore. Lot of restaurants and shops. But needs a bigger wallet. Vibrant and beautiful
,,You really need to see this place,4.0,,"Yes I agree that most shops are extremely expensive but some people are missing the point. You can easily spend a lot of time here due to the enormous size, photography opportunities inside and out, restaurants etc... Not to mention the casino. If you want gifts etc go to orchid Rd or Bugis junction but there you won't get these sights and experience. Not all places are expensive."
,,"Intersting to Visit, too expensive to buy anything.",3.0,,"This shopping centre's covers 3 levels. 90% of the shops are High end and way out of my budget. Not sure how they all survive as I didn't see anyone shopping in them. Many of the shops I had never heard of. It was interesting to walk around and window shop but they were all out of my price range. At one end is a food court that covers a lot of Asian foods. Reasonably priced. A lady walks around with a cart of drinks. The other end is a boat trip you can do, which looks like a waste of money. Its about 150m long up and back. We saw no one doing it."
,,Honestly not much attraction,3.0,,"It is the usual shopping mall, see one you them all... The only difference is it is far away, inconvenient. Underground mall connecting to Marina Bay is not stunning like in Taipei. It used to be great place when satay club was around... Now the big ugly durian arts theater is there.
Shopping mall food not fantastic and expensive. Hawker center and those out doors with personality shops are much better. Marina Bay... abit old and wash out... The place is like Orchard Road many malls and no personality. A signature that says I am here. I would recommend go Orchard Road more malls and centrally located or go to heartland malls. maybe smaller but within the local community."
,,Not so good,1.0,,"Really not worth visting. The food court is pricey, the fashion store staff are really in a bad mood and don't want to be there (Hermes to name one). Nothing you can get here that you can't find at any other mall in Singapore. Avoid!"
,,Excellent shopping centre,5.0,,"The Shoppes are an excellent attachment to Marina Bay Sands and makes for a broad range of options and convenience. Great variety of high end stores, plenty of restaurants and cafes, a good food court and all so clean. Unbelievable the constant cleaning. MRT station is here too for added convenience. Suggest making the most of this during your stay at MBS."
,,"Expansive shopping on 3 levels and more, worth visiting",4.0,,"Since everyone goes to the Marina Bay Sands anyway, it is worth it to check out the Shoppes also. Lots of high end stores, really high end, not so many normal stores with regular prices. An extensive food court, a Starbucks (of course), a theater with live performances and even a boat ride feature on the bottom level, kind of like the Venetian in Las Vegas.

I wouldn't go seek this out myself necessarily, it is worth checking out/walking through if in the building. There is a MTR attached to the Shoppes and a large fast moving taxi stand right in front of the Shoppes also."
,,Downstairs food hall a real find,4.0,,High end shops galore plus name restaurants. Best find though is the down stairs food hall where I had the best schezuan dumplings in a very long time.
,,Expensive shopping.. the shoppes.,5.0,,The shoppes at the Marina bay is an expensive shopping paradise which is located close to the Marina bay sands. We visited this place during our singapore and its a shopping destination of the expensive brands. It's worth visiting while you are at this place. Never miss it.
,,phenomenon place to walk around even if you don't want to buy anything,5.0,,"I don't think anyone would skip this place when coming to Singapore, especially this shopping center is right underneath Marina Bay Sands.
This shopping mall have everything and by everything I mean all the high end shops from all over the world. So if you are someone who have some mad cash burning a hole in your wallet then this will be your place to go. Oh you can also gamble at the casino in there but I didn't go in :3

If someone ask how long I think one should spend in the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands then I will definitely tell them you can spend more than one day here as there are a lot to see and restaurant to eat. So if you got time during your holiday or work trip when in Singapore then definitely spend a whole day here because you can definitely do that. My girlfriend and I went to this mall multiple times throughout our trip in Singapore and not once we felt that we need to go somewhere else because its getting boring.
I didn't buy anything there as well nothing really suited my style and didn't want to bust out so much money (definitely money is the main reason for me not buying anything). We did however ate at the food court which had a lot of variation of food and it is downstairs on lower level towards the back of the mall depending which way you come into the Shoppes. Would also highly recommend Canton Paradise on the top floor (two floor right above the food court) and Din Tai Fung (same level as foodcourt)
Just like any mall in Singapore, it is not only a place to shop, eat and relaxes but also a place where you can escape the hot, humid weather outside. AC is really good in here but I would say if one is sensitive to cold then bring a sleeved shirt or something because if you do stay in there for a while it might get a bit chilly. Not that I felt cold, it was a HUGE relief on my body from the outside heat.

Regarding Wifi, Starbucks have free wifi but only within their shop range, They do have wifi but its reserved for the Marina Bay Sands hotel guests which we were so we didn't have the problem with walking around without wifi. The wifi connection was good all around the mall!"
,,High End Branded Shops,4.0,,The shops at Marina Bay Sands are on the ground floor of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Most of them cater for high end branded stuff that is not very easy on the pocket. Having said that it is a great place to roam about and spend a pleasant hour or so in Singapore.
,,The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands in Singapore,5.0,,"If you're looking for the largest collection of luxury shops in Singapore... it's The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands that you are looking for!!!! It's at least 3 huge levels of very high end shopping. There are lots of great restaurants, an off Broadway theatre, and even a real water canal running through the lower level. You can even take a boat ride if you like! It's surely a must visit place in Singapore!!!!"
,,High end,4.0,,"Very high end shopping, with a couple of affordable places to eat and drink. Think the cheaper end stores where banana republic and Victoria secret, but those were the exception. If you want to buy affordable stuff unique to Singapore try elsewhere."
,,World class shoppes,4.0,,Beautiful surroundings and almost all luxury brands are inside this mall.Had a high end shopping experience at this world class shoppes
,,Shop-Eat-Drink--Repeat,4.0,,"Enjoyable area to satisfy all in your group or a solo visit. Enjoy easy acces to Sentosa Island, as well as the sights and sounds of restaurants by the Bay"
,,Must-visit shopping destination for mid-range and high-end brands.,5.0,,"My husband and I went here 4 or 5 times during our two-week stay in Singapore. Went to Sephora for a bit of shopping, had dinner at the food court for Korean food, and went to the casino, too. Just outside the mall is the fountain and lights show which starts at 8pm. On the top most floor, you can go outside and take a good look at the scenery or cross the Helix bridge."
,,I just love this place,4.0,,"Ok, ok, ok, i admit. I do like shopping (at times)! And yes, I usually do spend more than my wife :-(. And I do really like this shopping mall. I prefer it over Orchard Rd, hands down. The setup is nice, not too crowded, an amazing collection of watch shops (last time I was here I spent 8 hours just watch shopping), and as a bonus, the food. The quality of the restaurants I have visited is just hawker quality (i.e. DELICIOUS), but then set in air conditioning. Perfect. MBS is a fixed part of my itinerary to S'pore."
,,I don't believe there can be a better mall than this,4.0,,"This mall situated by Marina Bay Sands hotel is extraordinary for its opulence. It is full of every high end store you could think of and the quality of the stores is second to none. The building itself is serene and beautiful and it's hard to imagine a better high end shopping experience.
My only criticism. Put the price on your goods and you may be surprised that we will buy more. Keeping it a secret and making us ask may not be your best policy. Some of us who can afford to shop on your stores like to know the price without the ubiquitous store assistant hovering around"
,,Best shops!!!,5.0,,"This place is amazing! Great array of shops, beautiful surroundings and a lovely selection of food. One of my favourite attractions in Singapore."
,,Shopping!,5.0,,Good mall! almost all luxury brands are inside this mall. the food court had many choices for food. took half day to shop around the mall.
,,Brilliant high end upscale mall with lots of natural light,5.0,,"Enjoyed my recent visit not so much for the shopping(many of shops cater for the ultra high end); but just to enjoy the bright & spacious interiors, with its well presented shopfronts, & views through the glass cladding to the city skyline
The ""canal"" on the lower level , is an attraction; as is the spectacular fountain(hourly) in the central concourse
There is a floor of fine dining & expensive options on the upper level. Good wheelchair access"
,,As High End as it Comes in Singapore,5.0,,"Ultra deluxe shopping malled joined to MBS Hotel and the MRT.

All the most expensive shops seem to have an outlet here. I like the Royal Selangor Pewter - good for corporate gifts. Nice restaurants here too - Punjab Grill, Wolfgang Pucks and Carnivore all spring to mind - all very expensive but nice food. Good air conditioning which makes strolling easier. Fresh, light and airy."
,,Arrived with MRT Station,4.0,,too hot to came at the afternoon but we arrived with good place after using MRT. easy track from changi to marina bay (harbourfront) and do walking til lau pa sat to lunch
,,luxurious,5.0,,"must see place, with brand name boutiques and casinos. if youre a tourist you dont need to pay for the entrance at the casino"
,,Just another mall ... NOT!,5.0,,"If you've seen my review of Ion Orchard Mall then then you'll know I thought it impossible to spend a whole day in a shopping mall. How wrong can you be! You want to buy something, well this place has from SevenEleven to Cartier & Hermes and everything in between. You'd like to eat here, well you can choose from average take-a-way up to Gordon Ramsey fine dining. Browse, stroll, just gawk. If you can resist the temptation to buy, good on ya!"
,,Excellent shopping centre,5.0,,This is a Landmark shopping centre in Singapore. World class shopping experience. We love this fabulous experience.
,,Spectacular,4.0,,"Another of Singapores many shopping malls. A whole range of high end shops, but what is amazing here is the scale. Spread over many floors the bottom leads out on to a terrace facing the waterfront whereas the top floor leads onto a huge water Lilly filled pond and palm walk. The Venition themed canal on the ground floor is just another quirk. Worth going just t have a look"
,,Where am I ? Could be anywhere in the world!,4.0,,"Magnificent shopping and recreation mall, truly world class. Very busy restraunts always full but a short wait gets you seated with good service."
,,a must if you like to browse designer shops,5.0,,"dont expect to come here and find anything but top end designer shops, there are no price tags so you just have to gaze in the windows and dream. You can get the measure of the clientele by the cars that are parked outside ie Porsche, Lamborghini, Ferrari etc"
,,Top end shopping,5.0,,"It represents most of the sophisticated international brands. The place has a fantastic ambiance most products are exclusive and pricey. Even if you can't afford to buy them, it is a pleasure to stroll around just to absorb the classy presentation and beauty of the place."
,,Luxurious shoppers paradise!,5.0,,"You are most likely passing through the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands at some point during your visit even if it is to have a quick glance through the numerous shops and restaurants at the mall.There are numerous internationally recognised shops such as Banana Republic, Zara and Guess and just as many of the luxurious brands such as Prada, Chanel and Cartier.

There are numerous restaurants catering to everyone's needs. My favourites were the Osteria and Pizzeria Mozza located at the Galeria level. These are a series of two Italian restaurants serving pasta and pizza located side by side owned by famous chef Mario Batali. A majority of the restaurants are on the upper end of the scale but definitely worth trying once.

You can take a boat ride, play at the casino or try out the skating rink.

The mall is open from 10.30am-11.00pm Sunday through Thursday and 13.30am - 11.30pm Friday and Saturday. The mall is quite busy all day long as Singapore is a shopper's heaven and being central it is often a break point from sightseeing and escaping the warm days. There is also free wifi.

Bayfront MRT is the nearest station and a short walk away. There is access to the hotel, the Skypark and Gardens by the Bay. The ArtScience Museum is located just outside one of the many entrances, as well as the bay where you can watch Spectra - the popular water show that plays 8 and 9pm each day."
,,OK,3.0,,"We traveled with kids. The places that they enjoyed the most are Hamley's, the boat ride, and the open area outside the shoppes. if you're traveling on a budget like us, eat at the Food Court. They have a good selection. We just wish there were more seats."
,,High end shopping at its best!,5.0,,"This shopping ""complex"" has almost every conceivable high-end retailer in the world and prices to match. This place is a shopper's paradise. The area itself is comfortable and inviting. Located on the water on Marina Bay. If you are a shopper you can't miss this experience! Then go upstairs for lunch!"
,,good to have a look,4.0,,"always interesting to look inside these buildings at the shops and attractions, is also the mrt station inside as well as the casino. ( note if you want to visit the casino take your passport)"
,,Food court only!,5.0,,"When we are going to Gardens by the Bay we normally pop into the b1 food court to grab lunch. Great place with a good mix of options all well priced. The sets come with a soup and veg, enough to fill you and it's cheaper than eating in GbtB."
,,"Wonderful ambience, could be any major city in the world!",5.0,,"Can spend a whole day here ,. all designed outlets, food that defies the imagination and ambience that is spot on with many photo opportunities!"
,,Window shopping,5.0,,High end shopping mall with well known local and international shops or boutiques showcasing the best money can buy. Great Michelin starred restitutions are found here.
,,Modern Luxury Mall,4.0,,"This could be a place to shop as much as to dine. It has many premium designer stores as much as high end ones. The dining establishments are plenty and of varied cuisines, including a few Michelin starred ones. For us it provide the much need respite from August heat as we made our way from the Flyer to the Marina Bay Gardens.

Either way you'd enjoy the place."
,,Cool looking mall,4.0,,This is a cool looking mall with tons of premium brand shops. There is also a mini canal where you can take boat rides.
,,Lots of premium outlets,5.0,,"There are many shops, fine dining restaurant and a casino in this mall. This place is suitable for people who loves to shop for branded items. The place is also easily accessible via MRT ( alight at Bay Front MRT ). This place is also a stone throw from Gardens by the bay and Marina Bay Sands."
,,Luxury,4.0,,"There are so many famous brand shops. If you can afford, it is a good place to do some shopping. Other than that, just stay inside having cool a/c and high speed wifi."
,,A lot of expensive brands,2.0,,We came for SG/ML and for us it just another mall with in the bassement a large food court and at the beginning a seven-eleven with very nice sandwiches
,,Ms,5.0,,"Very classic shopped mall. Plenty if shops from mid end to high end. Good customer's service. Bought clothes with good buys at sales prices. There are good food places like restaurants and food courts. Caters to various food from Western, European and Asian foods. Good surrounding views of Singapore water front, beautiful and scenic. A good place to visit. Must go."
,,Impressive,4.0,,"The place is a bit unique because of the boat ride inside in a man-made mini-lake! (see pics). It is strategically located between the 'Events plaza' - the place where you have laser show every evening at 8, 9 - and the MBS hotel (skypark) - this adds to its value. The place has a number of luxury brands present on premise. Nice ambience."
,,Impressive,5.0,,An impressive amount of quite high end brands as well as a nice architecture. Don’t miss the sound and light show right in front of it
,,Place to hang around when weather is hot!,4.0,,"Marina bay mall is a very huge and up scale mall in Singapore. (There's a casino there)
As an up scale mall so all designers brands over there, but the architecture itself is worth to be enjoy.
Especially at the night when in the middle of river gondola (somewhere close by) there is water pouring down from glass ceiling, without using electricity but a giant machine contains group of small stainless steel pieces working like fans that move the water and drain or pouring down the glass ceiling! Very awesome!

For meals in the food court is pretty pricey and nothing special. Better to touring each floor and find nicer restaurants with better quality and tastier.

Another thing you can visit Louis Vuitton boutique which usually the window shopping person won't get the chances to get in. This boutique is like a museum itself. (I think biggest store in whole world)"
,,A great place to eat good food,4.0,,We enjoy eating at this particular food court when we visit singapore. The korean food is our favourite and I always choose the barbequed chicken dish served with a soup and condiments for around $10. Another favourite there is a dessert bar where I buy a yummy mango pudding. We have learnt over the years to always secure a table before ordering food as it is a very popular food court and gets very busy especially on the weekends
,,High End Shopping,4.0,,"A really cool place to visit. The shops are all high end, outside there is a great view back towards the city, Merlion and Fullerton Hotel. The MRT stops right at there. The gondolas that run through the heart of it are really cool, as is the large fountain in center. There are plenty of places to stop and eat or drink. It is a good way to spend a few hours."
,,"Eating at ""1983 A Taste of Nanyang"" food court of The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands",4.0,,"""1983 A Taste of Nanyang"" foodcourt at The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands is one eating place where one can enjoy a pleasant meal at any one time, may it be breakfast, lunch, dinner or just having a snack. It has variety of local hawker foods and will be a delight for those who love these kind of foods. There is a halal foodstall which serves nasi lemak (white rice cooked in rich coconut cream) with all the trimmings of slices of cucumber, small spicy fried fish, chicken wings, anchovies and spoonfuls of delicious chilly sauce cooked with onions & garlic. There are also a variety of other Malay Muslim dishes at this stall for choices. The other stalls serves chicken rice and noodles, fried oyster omelette, western foods in their varieties (fish& chips, pastas, soups, etc), a special noodles stall devoted to their own recipes & cooking styles and also included, there is also typical North Indian foodstall which served exciting curries, dhalls, Naan & rice. There is also a stall which serves delicate, colorful local desserts, which are not to be missed. But one can say, the prices at this place is a tat higher than the local foodcourts, perhaps, due to the exclusive location at The Shoppes Marina Bay Sands. But nothing beats the ambiance, the cleanliness, the air condition environment and its close proximity in a lovely shopping mall. The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands is fairly easy to locate (its located next to the CBD area) & within walking distance from the Tanjong Pagar MRT station. There's also ample car park spaces and if anything fails you.....just hop into a cab. Enjoy...!"
,,Lots of big brands,4.0,,"It's a nice mall with lots of lighting, escalators, and good A/C. Inside, there's a look-a-like Venice with boat riding, casino, and a skate rink. Expensive shops and restaurants as well are inside as well. Easy to get lost if you're heading to the convention center from the mall, but there's a lot of info booths around."
,,Luxurious Shopping Mall,5.0,,"This must be the most expensive shopping mall in Singapore due to the number of designer labels located here - Gucci, Christian Louboutin, Prada etc. Even if you cannot afford to buy anything, I would say go for the experience. There is also a little lake right in the middle of the shopping mall where you can have a slow boat ride. They also have a food court and expensive restaurants as well. On the top floor, you can watch a laser show at set times in the evening and also admire the beautiful skyline. Highly recommended!"
,,Night time is much better,5.0,,We went to Marina around night time. We walked a few minutes around the shopping complex and watched the water shows. It was nice to enjoy the scenery from Marina Bay.
,,Good place to go if you lead a luxurious life,3.0,,"Lots of luxurious shops in this shopping center. Personally, I do not especially enjoy shopping. We just had late dinner at the food court next to the rink after spending our time in the roof top pool of MBS. Price of the food in the food court is reasonable. It costs less than SGD 10 for most of the noodle and rice."
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,"If you want to visit a lovely mall this is the place to go. Especially when it's raining outside. Huge mall, expensive and lots of brand names. We had an expensive lunch but lovely food, service and great tea at TWG Tea Garden"
,,Super high end,4.0,,"Absolutely beautiful, high end, shopping mall. Louis Vuitton, Dior, Louboutin, Prada, Givenchy, etc. If you have the cash, or have excellent credit, this would be your ideal playground. Even the foods here are super pricey and on a new level of extra.

Enjoyable window shopping experience none the less."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Another great place to visit, the shops here are fantastic and the mini canal running through is a great feature, a full day out not to be missed"
,,"Super Spacious, Luxurious Mall worth while visiting",4.0,,"Although not many may have the capacity to shop here, the mall itself is worth while visiting: it is very spacious, luxurious, and has a very beautiful as well as impressive interior lay out, design & ornaments.
It's food court has also a wide range of culinary choices.
There's also a nice gondola ride, which which visitor can enjoy ..."
,,Marina Bay of SG,5.0,,"Must visit place! Malls on the ground, viewing deck and the light shows for free! You will be amazed by its beauty!"
,,Great mall and a gondola ride!!!,5.0,,"The mall is amazing, but the best part is the gondola at the underground floor. You think you are in Venice!!! For a small price, get on the gondola to go for a romantic 10 minutes ride in the artificial small river of the mall. A true miracle!!"
,,Marina Bay shopping and sightseeing.,4.0,,"We spent a number of hours shopping and sightseeing at this very central Singapore location. Close to many tourist attractions, including the Singapore Flyer, Gardens by the Bay and Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Good restaurants and an excellent area to stay whilst in Singapore."
,,Fun Place,5.0,,"Even if you are not a guest at the Hotel, there is a large shopping complex (several floors with many shops) and a great Food Court."
,,Best mall I've ever been in,5.0,,"Blown away by this mall, my favourite was the Dubai Mall but this has the edge. We spent a bit of time over at Marina Bay and always ended up here. The food court was amazing. I loved the canals and the water fall from the whirlpool above, with the rowing boats. It seemed like a great place for British and American families to hang out with their kids in the skating rink. Louis Vuitton was amazing as you enter through an art gallery where you catch the escalator and find yourself out on an island which at night has twinkling lights."
,,Typical high end mall,3.0,,"This mall is pretty average and like any high end mall you come across. I wont recommend visiting here unless you have that sort of money to spend or you enjoy window shopping. Your famous brands are here such as Gucci, Prada etc. The only thing I would recommend is the promenade behind the mall with excellent views of the city and financial buildings which is a great spot for pictures."
,,Luxury extravaganza,4.0,,"This shopping centre comes in addition to the Marina Bay hotel, and it's luxury at its best, with all the haute couture shops you can imagine. It's so extravagant it has a gondola channel right inside it! While you're there you can take the chance to try the delicious dumplings of Din Tai Fung."
,,Some great food places.,5.0,,Great food options here we went for one where they give you a card as you enter pay as you leave-had great shredded Potato-called costii?really nice had with 2 eggs partner had seafood soup-excellent choices.
,,Luxurious!!,5.0,,"It's a part of Marina Bay sands hotel. This is a high end and well designed shopping mall with an artificial canal, casino, restaurants etc. Entry to casino is free for foreigners. Almost all luxury brand shops are also there. Do go for at least window shopping."
,,Wow,5.0,,"One of the best malls in Singapore - it has all the brands you could wish for. From Ralph lauren to Gucci and D&G. This is serious luxury. Very well located, right next to the merlion and singapore flyer. The mall has an excellent view of the setting sun and the bay area. Do go if you have time at hand"
,,Upmarket Mall - popular with Tourists,4.0,,This is a huge complex of mostly ‘brand name’ upmarket shops – lots of open spaces and wide concourses – at the one end there is a fantastic reasonably priced Food Court with international cuisines vying for your custom – these are centered around a small ice rink – there is a high rollers casino here and several movie theaters – a small canal at the entrance from the Bayfront MTR station has ‘gimmicky sampans’ that take you on a short ride to where a vortex of water cascades from a feature in the floor above into the center of a large pool – if the heat and humidity are getting to you this is a good place to spend some time in the air-con even if you do not intend to shop
,,"Top destination for honeymooners, much more of a tourist attraction than a shopping mall?",5.0,,"Picture yourself on a boat inside an air-conditioned shopping mall, surrounded by gold bling. I found shop staff were very talkative as they looked forward to welcoming the next entourage of shoppers. Practically it can mean that you might find the mall is occasionally closed. All things being equal (ceteris paribus) they should let you in for an Americano coffee, once you find the coffee shops. It was mad, but I loved it!"
,,A big and fancy shopping mall.,3.0,,"I somehow refuse to be impressed by this mall.
Sure, it's big and everything, with ponds, a water canal and an ice skating ring, but it still remains just another shopping mall of high-end shops and prices to match.
Its location, however, is hard to beat."
,,A beautiful high end mall,4.0,,"Numerous Western eateries, high end shopping and even an ice skating ring. Multiple levels, ATM's, money changers. A great break."
,,A break from the heat,4.0,,Beautiful shops to look around and escape the humidity. Look out for the gondolas and the water fountain. Didn't do any shopping but there are some nice eateries catering for all price ranges
,,Marina bay,4.0,,"Really nice to spend some time in the mall or casino (bring passport), not worth paying to go up to the bar though, view is very limited."
,,So amazing at early morning,5.0,,"Only less people will go there at early morning (around 3 am). Even though all shops are closed that time, The Shoppes is still opened with full air condition and lighting. If raining outside, it is so amazing to see it through very large glass or big bowl."
,,What other mall has a waterway in it???,5.0,,"The boats cruising throughout are the first to catch your eye, but aside from that innovation, there are more stores than one could ever possibly dream of. The options are endless."
,,Great vibe,5.0,,"If your in Singapore make sure you visit this mall.of designer brand shops.
Went there twice and just loved it and spend some of our hard earned AUD as well.
The centre piece for me has to be the cascading water fall in the middle a great place.to have a coffee and just watch as we did.
Easy to get to on the MRT if you dont have a private chauffeur or driver ."
,,Welcome to the bubble,4.0,,"If you are staying at the sands you can leave your wallet at home (charge your meals at fancy restaurants to your room) and not step a foot into the outside world (if that's your thing).
There are designer shops galore, the theatre, ice skating rink, river and boats, specialty food stores, a chemist and lots of restaurants (ranging from the food court to uber fancy).

The food court is nice if you are wanting any type of Asian food. The speciality restaurants throughout are delicious and there is lots of choice.

The architecture is very interesting and worth a look, especially when it rains as the rainwater is funnelled into a water fall.

It does feel stale, and being an outdoors person and not interested in high fashion I easily got bored but it depends on what you are interested in."
,,lots of walking but worth it,4.0,,"the shops are nice, but we went for the food court. And the food court is worth the visit, Great fresh food for a good price. Watch the chefs pull the noodles in front of you, can it get any better?"

,,Disappointed,1.0,,"I stopped here during the slow time of day. When I walked into the store, I was not greeted by the two employees currently on the floor. I wandered around the store for almost 10 minutes, and no one acknowledged or offered to help me locate the items I was looking for. Instead of returning, I will purchase the item I was looking for from Amazon."
,,The laser show,5.0,,The evening laser show was great. It also has a nice selection of shops and food court. It has excellent conference rooms and everything is managed very well. I would recommend this place to host any conference.
,,Must visit not just to shop,5.0,,"We spent time wandering around and got immersed in the shear size and number of things to do here.
Shops were amazing and best of all we found our favourite breakfast spot that server perfect eggs benedict.
Even if you don't like casino's this is a must see.
Boat trips are also available?
Soo many features and it's huge!"
,,Amazing view and experience,5.0,,Pay the $20SNG and go up to the bar at sunset and have a drink. The view is spectacular. The shopping centre is also amazing with gorgeous shops and cafes. Catch the boat to Clarke Quay and see the light show at sunset also.

,,High-end,4.0,,This is an impressive set of high-end shops at the Marina Bay Sands. It's also a very nice break from the heat and humidity!
,,A must see,5.0,,"Lots of shopping, sightseeing and restaurants, this is a definite stop in Singapore. Whether for a leisurely walk or full out day trip, Marina Bay is the place to be."
,,RAIN OCULUS & FOOD COURT Don't miss it!,5.0,,"Even if you don't like shopping, The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands are definitely worth a visit- and it's free to look, with bonus air conditioning! Our daughters loved looking at Sephora & Bath & Body Works. Fortunately there were comfy chairs to sit in while we waited!
It's almost like 2 shopping malls in one. One end has the delicious & value for money food court, cafes and the usual retail shops and an ice skating rink, while the other end is definitely high end with designer shopping, restaurants and gives access to the casino, and nowhere to sit!
The highlight for us was the amazing Rain Oculus by artist Ned Kahn. The Oculus is a 70 foot diameter acrylic bowl which releases a whirlpool of 200 tons of water into the canal ( complete with gondolas/boats) 2 stories below. We just happened to be in the right place when it started up. It's quite mesmerising to watch. This can be viewed outside at street level or on one of 2 levels inside. Definitely worth a visit!"
,,Pretending we were rich,5.0,,"Myself and my two kids (22 and 14) loved walking around this mall and looking at all the designer shops. It was also a great retreat from the heat. There are lots of very high end shops here, but also some more affordable options too.
The dining options are plentiful too with many celebrity chef restaurants, rooftop bars, and food courts and cafes.
We spent around three hours here and you can even ice skate or go for a gondola ride."
,,Shop till you drop!,4.0,,"A good selection of shops and restaurants all under one roof, close to Marina Bay, the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome and the CPD."
,,Upscale mall attached to the casibo,4.0,,A very upscale mall attached to the casino with many designer shops. A little hokey but you can take a gondola ride down the fake waterway in the mall. A few decent food choices.
,,Money money !,3.0,,Paradise for shopping lovers with big pockets. This place is huge and has a lot of stores from high end to average shopping. This place is good with centralized air cooled when it is hot outside.
,,Great shopping,5.0,,Enjoy all types of retail therapy. Suntec and Marina Bay cover all your fashion and tec desires. Happy shopping.
,,Picturesque,5.0,,A most enjoyable walk from the MRT station and one of the most modern malls you could possibly hope for. There are all the expensive shops and heaps of more moderate price establishments.
,,like a town on its own,5.0,,"Huge and high end, but tucked in the lower ground was the best low cost fast food centre. Spoilt for choice for good restuarants!"
,,The grand shopping mall,4.0,,"Each time to Singapore i sure will have a visit at marina bay sands.. just like the the indoor canal in The Shoppes is particularly impressive, as it has faux-antique sampan boats which can be booked for a lap of the mall with your own sampan driver to paddle you around.."
,,"Good night life, people watching",4.0,,"Like all of Singapore, shopping is king here. The main difference is that here you will find many of the chic brands (Louis Vuiton, etc.). Bring your credit card and enjoy."
,,Luxury,3.0,,Definitely meant for the richer folk in life. This place is just one big luxury sandwich. There are an abundance of high end designers and jewellers in the vicinity.
,,Huge high-end mall,4.0,,"Almost all of the big retail brands are here. You must have a big shopping budget to enjoy it. Great place too just to window shop and pile up the 10,000 steps."
,,Every Upscale and Unique Shop you Could Want,5.0,,"There are hundreds of shops at the Marina Bay Sands. Everything from small grocery stores with fresh local fruit cut daily to the largest selection of TWG tea you will ever see. There are many designer and upscale clothing and shoe shops. There is a food court as well as some specialty restaurants (like TWG's, outside of the store) and it is a very short walk to the hotel restaurants. The environment is fun, clean, and climate controlled. Best of all, if not everyone wants to shop in the hotel skybridge offers a wonderful view of Gardens By the Bay or you can go to the top of the hotel and take in the sweeping view."
,,Where all the luxury brands come together,4.0,,"It's almost an all-in-one mall to begin with! From Shopping to staycation... From Sightseeing to work convention... From Salon, to manicure and massage..Literally, everything"
,,Great shopping,5.0,,"Great shopping with a view,all the high end shops are in the mall by the Sands Hotel.The bum boats are fun to ride around the marina!"
,,Worth a vist,4.0,,"I would not necessary rave about this place. It is a bit like Caesars palace meets the Venetian in Vegas. Is worth a visit for the upmarket shops lovely cafes and water shows. The Casino is a bit like any other but the security to get into it is a bit off putting, You must have your passport to get in.

The place is very expensive, The only good value is the food court at the far end where you can pick from lots of different cuisines at a reasonlb price."
,,Totally amazing shopping choice !,5.0,,"This place is an absolutely shopping Mecca .. having been dragged around designer brand malls for more years than I care to remember by my wife and daughters , the one
thing that always drives me crazy is the fact that usually , no single shopping location satisfies all three of them .

When they try a bag from Givenchy they want to "" just check first "" the Celine version .. to make sure it definitely is the one they want ... or one of them really likes Gucci but is convinced by the others that they should get into Chanel ..

I feel like a naturalist making a documentary as I observe the happiness and exhilaration they feel going into all these ridiculously and outrageously expensive stores ..and their insatiable thirst for more ..

And the point to my story , is that usually , almost always .. even in the deepest consumer excess that is Vegas , you have to travel to various malls and communities to get the full crazy shopping experience ..

And professional crazy shoppers like my wife and children accept this ,dragging me in their wake usually , they decide on their retail therapy the night before ..through a system of compromises .

One must see Chanel and Gucci and would like to see something again in Burberry .. so the mall should have all three ..
another one needs some perfume from Caroline Herrera and also wants to see a particular Louboutin shoe ..
But to add more hassle into the mix two of them desperately need to visit Sephora or their world will end ..so that must be factored in too ...
Then they scan all the mall directories with all the focus and determination of air traffic controllers at rush hour ..

Before long you realise and accept that your whole day will be spent walking round NYC or Vegas trying to satisfy your loved ones consumer madness .. because no one place has the lot , so to speak .
No one place has everything ..

Or does it ...?

Step forward , drum roll ..

The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands ..

They've taken all the best crazy price shops in the Vegas Bellagio , Wynn , Venetian and Caesars .. thrown in every floor of Tiffany's and Barney's New York and added the entire fashion collections from Harvey Nicks and Harrods in London , then put a big roof on , a taxi rank & valet parking outside , air conditioning and a range of coffee stops for Dad ..( most thoughtful, thank you Sands )

So if you REALLY like your shopping , it's simply impossible not to be satisfied here ..

And as you are waiting for the crazy fashion shoppers in your family to knock themselves out with the fatigue of their addiction , the coffee choice in here is pretty good too ."
,,Quiet and dull,2.0,,Very empty when we visited about lunchtime. Best part was food court on bottom level. Shops felt sparse and not really that appealing.
,,Luxurious,4.0,,"This shopping mall is filling with designer after designer, it's impressive and I enjoyed looking around at all the things I could never afford. There's a Louis Vuitton to a DC superhero cafe!
The mall has an ice rink and a water canal running down the centre where you can ride a ride down it. It's so cool, nothing like I've seen before.
The food court is very good, lots of cultural food for a reasonable price.
The air con is beautiful, so if you're baking in the weather go for a walk around shops.
It is all high end goods, very expensive just to warn you.

If you enjoy a look around the shops, or even taking photos of this huge mall! It's worth a visit, it's very very impressive."
,,Pricey,3.0,,Strictly average unless you have loads of money in which case you can go wild. Everything is expensive and even the so called venice boat ride is extremely pricey. Suprisingly though the food mall is relatively cheap so go and have some roast chicken and sticky rice.
,,Unbelievable,5.0,,"I walked around this place with my mouth wide open and my hand on my wallet. But just an awesome mall where nothing cost less than $1,000.00."
,,Beautiful shopping centtr,5.0,,"A high end shopping center with a bar at the top. It also houses a casino which if you choose to enter you will need your passport. It is worth a look, although you probably won't buy anything"
,,"An enginnering marvel,considering it is all built on reclaimed land.",4.0,,"We visited in February and took the lift to the observation level for a great view of the city from 3 sides.
My only disappointment was we were told by friends who had visited previously that the roof top bar was open for non residents, but when we attempted to walk through the roped off entrance that this was not the case . Otherwise it was a great view.
We watched the night time fireworks from our hotel rooftop the next night."
,,Wow,4.0,,Every designer I think in the world has a store in this mall. Also lots of celebrity chefs have restaurants here. Attached to the Sands convention center. It also has theaters and a ice skating rink in addition to an outside amphitheater.
,,"Opulent, Over-the-Top, Ultimate Lifestyle shopping theatre",5.0,,"Incredibly massive, iconic & elegant shopping theatre. Architecturally beautiful, very open, chrome & glass edifice; seen-to-be-seen, mall. Floating pavillions, indoor skating rink, breathtaking Sands SkyPark, infinity swimming pool and more, it is the ultimate in luxurious decadence.

The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands' frontage is a gigantic, water-feature over 2 levels. From the top, it is a whirlpool; from the bottom it is hurricane water spout; the functions as both a skylight and a rain collector: rain oculus. Mesmerising, timing the seconds before the next display. The shoppers, on floor below the water feature - suddenly surprised with noisy, gushing fountain spout. Whirlpool to a waterfalls? This I had to see for myself.

Full of top-end luxury, designer brands and goods. There is a man-made canal where canal-boats (or sampans) take visitors for short sight-seeing trips inside the complex. (Similar to Las Vegas, where it is gondolas taking tourists for a gondola-ride in the Venetian casino). I have gait/walking challenges (stroke), all sightseeing has to be well-researched and not overly taxing; I wear a legbrace. Though this is flat area, there's a lot of walking involved.

We went by metro. Designer-exclusives, (Balenciaga, Bvlgari, Chanel), luxury cars (Ferrari) housed on one of the floors. Theatre, water & light shows, music events. Heaps of foodie places, gourmet paradise by celebrity chefs, dim sum restaurants, even the hawker-food section within the huge complex. We had a quick bite at the hawker food centre; pretty long walk inside gigantic area – very packed but visitors were coming and going and we easily found seats to enjoy our meal. As it is so HUGE allow yourself plenty of time if you're getting to somewhere specific. Also linked to Gardens By The Bay.

Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands had everything larger-than-life, ultra bling. A definite must to visit."
,,IMPRESSIVE ARCHITECTURE THAT'S ALL,3.0,,"You arrive and it's WOW. Impressive the least. Yet not the kind of location I would want to spend time. All of it it's way too much, too much shopping too much foodies too much luxury too much glitter TOO MUCH LV, PRADA, CARTIER, too many people and tourists.
It is to visit yet I don't recommend it.
CIAO"
,,Beautiful View and Scenery,5.0,,This place is huge and beautiful. The building is so majestic and great for photograph at the evening. You can do your shopping and visit Gardens by the Bay.
,,Great location and lot of options,5.0,,This place is located at the perfect place. It houses almost all the brands. Skating area is very nice too. Best is to shop here and connected to Casino.
,,A Remarkable place with stunning views and a wide variety of shops and restaurants,4.0,,This a must place to see both day and night situated on many floors you get stunning views of the surrounding buildings and attractions. There is a wide variety of posh shops and restaurants even with a canal running through the middle. Stunning views of the skyline at night.
,,Tourtist mecca,5.0,,Great place to visit. Good shopping with interlinking underground shopping malls. Great access to MRT.
,,"Great place to,window shop",4.0,,This is a very extensive up market shopping area spread across three or four floors - you have to have serious amounts of funds to shop here - but even if you don't you can spend several hours looking at the shops
,,Wow an impressive Mall that's great to visit at night with the lights on the bay.,4.0,,"I visited the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands primarily to visit the 'Long Chimp' Thai restaurant, but walking through the Mall to get to my dining venue I was mightily impressed with the scale of this high-end shopping Mall. The interactive maps that help you find your destination are an excellent customer aid. When I got to the Atrium 2 to Long Chimp I could look down onto the Sands Casino floor which again was an impressive visual experience. All in all this is a great Mall and well worth a walk through."
,,Great shopping,5.0,,Great place for shopping Great walk along the waterfront and then across the spiral bridge Good view of lights show across the bay
,,Good evan if not shopping,4.0,,"The way the mall, hotel and the area is built good enough just to go for a walk. A few attractions around tjhe laser show the boat trip in the mall and various other water features."
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,"Had a great time visitng, shopping is for big spenders and high end. Whilst there take a visit to the roof top of Marina bay sands for an unbeatable view."
,,High End Shopping,5.0,,"Fabulous designer shops, all the big names are here... Spend a day here easily, lovely concept... Tea at Twinings is gorgeous ..."
,,Orchard Road then taxi to here,5.0,,If you love designer shopping then Singapore is for you. If Orchard Road doesn't empty the wallet then head here for even more shops.
,,quite an impression,4.0,,"It is a different world when you enter the shoppes. Everything is bright, clean, big. Everybody smiles at yo (they are expecting you to spend a lot, of course!).
If you time you visit a little bit, yuo can see the rain occulus (at the end of the canal) fill in from above and pour into the canal. Quite impressive, so much noise, and it gets chilly after 15 minutes of falling water! We viewed it ""by accident"" while lunching at the coffee bean and tea leaf, refreshing!
Even if you enter ""just to look"", don't be surprised if you get tackled by the ambiance and the moment and exit with branded bags full of luxury stuff!!!"
,,If you have serious money to burn,5.0,,"Every shop is designer, the centre is just pure indulgence from start to finish. There is a gondola, ice rink and all other sorts of hidden gems. Worth a visit even if you keep your wallet deep in your pocket"
,,"Beautiful Mall, Very High End, Higher Pricing",5.0,,"This mall is absolutely beautiful, but get ready to spend money.

A must-know tip before going: this mall raises its prices more than any other Singapore or international store due to its location at Marina Bay Sands. For example, a purse in Ted Baker was $419 SG ($398 Canadian), and I checked online to see if it was available in Canada when I returned, and it was $299 Canadian. Therefore, it was marked up roughly $100. A jacket in Zara was marked at MBS for $113 CDN and was $89 online. You get the idea. With this said, many stores have promotions and tourist offerings - especially if you're a hotel guest at MBS - some stores offer at 10% discount. As well, bring your passport if you would like to get the tourist receipt for getting a tax refund at the airport when you leave.

The interior is stunning, large hallways and high end stores that flaunt their latest collections in perfectly curated window designs. There is a huge water stream through the centre of the mall to take a boat ride, although beware everyone will stare at you.

Aide from the mall's beauty, this mall only carries high end/couture brands (ie Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Chanel etc), with a very few more affordable stores such as Zara and Bath & Body Works. Of anything, it's great to enjoy the air con, people watch and give yourself something to do to kill the day. If you're a high-end fashionista - it's your heaven.

Due to the clientele, majority of sales people speak both English and Cantonese if not more languages.

A few last tips - there is a food court in the bottom that sells good priced hawker style food. Lastly, if you're staying at MBS and get tired of paying $20 for a beer, head to the Guardian store on the B2 level and get very cheap beer and wine to bring back to your room. A Tiger Beer 6-pack is $17.30 SG, several wine bottles for $20 SG and a bottle of Jacobs Creek Sparkling bubbly for $35 SG. A steal!

Happy high end shopping!"
,,INDOOR ORCHARD ROAD,4.0,,Indoor AC high end shopping mall and restaurant venue. Very contemporary with a nice atmosphere . Connected to the hotel and casino. Hope this helps.
,,WOW,5.0,,"Seriously loved this place. Every high end brand you could think off. Very clean and well maintained but also very hard to navigate! Would recommend getting a map.

Great indoor gondola rides which was unique and a wide range of price ranges, however definitely more on the expensive end."
,,Spectacular Place!,5.0,,"A massive, modern and beautiful structure. One of the nicest malls you'll see in your life with almost every designer you can possibly think of having a retail branch inside. The Louis Vuitton store alone is more the size of an entire department store. The spectacular light show in the evenings by the bay just outside of the mall puts the light show at the Bellagio in Las Vegas to shame. You shouldn't pass this place up if you're in Singapore."
,,The Shoppes at Marina Bay,4.0,,"Although Singapore has a numerous array of mall for shopping you may also visit this vast mall, for its many luxury branded stores , and restaurants. The best part about this complex is the open air riverside view when the lights come on. You can also visit the casino ,observation deck and the rooftop bar for another level of experience."
,,Just great,5.0,,A very interesting shopping centre and restaurants at Marina Bay. We caught a cruise from the cruise centre. Terrific building. Well laid out
,,High end Mall,4.0,,"Opulance aplenty here!
Very smart building indeed, adjacent to The Marina Bay Sands Hotel.
Extensive area, with lots of boutique shops and designer name brands.
Water feature with boats inside the Mall too.
Lots of space, never feels busy.
Good choice of restaurants and eateries, plus a casino.
Properly expensive so window shopping for the majority!"
,,"Expensive shopping, window shopping for me....but amazing to see",5.0,,"The shops were extensive and I had never seen so many designer shops in one area before. There is a canal inside the shoppes area, you can take a gondola ride in. There is an ice skating rink if you would like to rent skates. The indoor water structure was amazing. It was great to walk around and just see all the different attractions within the mall. The shopping is very high end and expensive."
,,Beautiful but Expensive,4.0,,Very big building with beautiful design but Expensive nice to walk during hot day at the entrance the was a group of 200 person doing sport dance together we enjoyed watching
,,Shopping galore,5.0,,It's a huge mall with lots of fancy restaurants and shops. Has a casino and an indoor water structure with the gondolas. A nice fixture in the middle of the best of what Singapore has to offer.
,,Nice place to visit.,4.0,,"If you are catching the MRT is is best to change at Marina Bay for Bayfront otherwise it is a short five minute walk from Marina Bay MRT station.
There are plenty of shops and restaurants to eat or browse. The best place to have something inexpensive is the food court as there is plenty to choose from. You can browse at all the different stores to see what is interesting without having to to buy anything or see if there is anything of interest you want to purchase.
If you want to go to the casino it is best to bring your passport along otherwise they will not let you in, not unless you are from the hotel.
When visiting here it is a good idea to go to the restaurant at the top of the hotel that is shaped like a ship as it is quite the experience to get a bird's eye view of Marina Bay especially in the evening."
,,Boring same old,3.0,,It's just a big mall full of designer outlets and restuarants. We ate in Bread Street Kitchen but why the fascination for top end restuarants in malls is beyond me. There is a tiny boat ride canal - nothing like the Vanetian in Las Vegas so don't expect much. Shops were a bit odd - I went into a jewelers with a fairly high intention of buying something and when I got to one cabinet I saw a table full of food through the back. I said oh is it lunchtime and they said yes and basically threw me out! Needless to say opening hours made no mention of closing for lunch. Oh well their loss I bought a nice pearl piece at another mall.
,,A negative aspect - not existing before! Management please take action.,3.0,,"This is truly the best shopping arcade in Singapore. Especially considering the hot weather outside. Here you find everything and it is an interesting venue just to browse without actually buying anything. There are nice restaurants and cafes too. Hence, I would give it 5 Stars where it not for the now prevalent accosting by overly aggressive sales people. They stand outside their shop, come up to you and offer free samples and try to involve you into a conversation. This cheapens this wonderful, upmarket destination. One can only hope that the management of The Shoppes will put a stop to this."
,,I am not a shopping fan but...,5.0,,"This place is quiet impressive. It's a big huge spacious tunnel filled with brand shops and restaurants, easy to find your way in and full of life as well.
Not everyone can afford shopping there, but going through is free for all!
Another place to be amazed by the city's amazing architecture."
,,Great shopping centre if you are after all the designer names,5.0,,"If not, it is just a great place to visit to see all the designer names. Beautiful shopping centre, easy to walk around and air conditioned (needed in Singapore). A mixture of shops and restaurants and also a food hall. You could be anywhere in the world though! They do have a great comic book shop with some memoribilia - great if you have a young one obsessed with batman!"
,,Beautiful shopping mall,4.0,,"A very beautiful and luxury shoppingmall, one of the so many in Singapore. But worth a visit because of the architecture outside but also inside and the lovely view of Marina bay ofcourse. Most big brands are there, exclusive shops as Louis Vuitton and more.. Very nice restaurants too and some has the choice of sitting outside. Also nice to have a drink watching the shoppers and the skyline at Marina Bay."
,,Shopping is a plus,5.0,,"The shopping experience is so great, even with just window shopping. You can enjoy watching nice brands, cheap or expensive."
,,Excellent shopping experience,5.0,,"Best shopping complex with all the High end Brand’s and medium range Brand’s all under one roof. Several must sees are the nightly laser show, try the sampan gondolo ride when the fountain tank filled with water flows down (think it's every 30m) and ask your friends to take some pictures. plentiful of celebrity restaurants(the good ones need pre book 1 day advance). Shop till you drop as shops open till 11pm on weekdays and 11:30pm on weekends. Must go is Louis Vuitton island as it has all the classic stuff at B2 where u can take photos !"
,,Impressive shopping centre ruined by valet thieves,2.0,,"Let me begin by saying that my rating of Poor is a reflection of the poor response and effort by the management of the shopping center to deal with their valets repeatedly stealing valuables from cars being parked. This has occurred twice to me, as well as a several friends... which Marina Bay Sands simply denies having happened.

Assuming you are not using their valet or any other shopping center service: the overall design and range of shops and restaurants is actually quite amazing.

Definitely one of the best shopping centers not just in Singapore, but in South-East Asia.

A great to visit whether couple, family or friends... with both indoor and outdoor options. Just be warned that the shops and restaurants (with the exception of the food court) are more on the premium side of things."
,,Massive display of wealth.,4.0,,One huge big mall with massively expensive shops. But it is a nice building. Was a good place to people watch and see how the rich folk live.
,,A high end shopping mall,3.0,,"You will love this place of shopping for high end brands like Chanel, LV, Gucci etc... That seems like their target audience since it's located near a casino. But other than that, nothing u wouldn't find at Orchard road.

Restaurants and cafes here can be crowded during lunch, so do eat early."
,,Wast of valuable tourist time.,2.0,,"A shopping centre attached to the Marina Bay Sands hotel - it is full of shops that only rich people shop at - you can see loads of people walking around these shops because they are close to the popular hotel, but nobody goes in to any of the shops!"
,,High End Shopping Mall,4.0,,"This mall has almost all of high end shopping and attractions. Daily you can view a water and light show at the deck. There is a casino, hotel, several restaurants and attractions including the skydeck is in this mall.A must visit even if you wont be buying. The best place to people watch and window shop."
,,Beautiful waterfront & Plenty of upscale shopping,4.0,,"The waterfront that the Marina Bay has is really scenic .. They have steps where yo can sit and relax and enjoy the breeze. In the evening you can see the Musical water fountain show

There is plenty of shopping to be done if you have the dough , you can find all hot brand stores here the likes of Gucci ,Armani etc..."
,,Trip thru the Marina Bay,5.0,,This area is great for shopping and just sightseeing. There are several places to eat and shop in the mall area and allong the waterway.
,,Beautiful and Expensive,5.0,,"I went here after going to Merlion. It is such a beautiful place, I got thirsty so i looked around to get something to drink. But everything are just so expensive inside the MArina shopping center. I took some photos and left."
,,Cool shopping mall,4.0,,"I'm not really a fan of shopping malls, but this one is quite fun. You can find a small garden on top of this mall. Inside you can find, besides all the expensive and luxury shops, a small river. You can even go on a boat there."
,,Leave the money outside,4.0,,"This is definitely one of the most expensive shopping places in Singapore if not the world. Nice place, a lot of famous brands, a lot of opportunities to spend your money."
,,Great shopping experience for non-shopper but it is worth a look!,5.0,,"The building itself is completely beautiful, bright, light and sophisticated. All the brand name products you would imagine is there! Lots of places you could sit down for light meal , coffee, tea or whatever you fancy. Singapore is only a small island and many times I am amazed by how spacious everything is ! It looks very international. The food court on the basement is always busting with people. Most shops open till late like 10-11 pm ."
,,Shopping,4.0,,What a shopping mall! We had previously been to the big mall in Dubai and we thought that we not see another as good. OK this is possibly a bit smaller but amazing. Every designer label shop you can think of and more. Food outlets galore and full of atmosphere as it was Chinese New Year. If you like shopping this is a must see.
,,Another must see,5.0,,Gray shopping centre and super place to wander to get a feel for this city. And it's next to the sands hotel
,,Grandious,4.0,,"Huge structure with all main brands in clothing and bags present. Also nice dining possibilities. On negative side I would mention ease of access and really complicated and difficult way of getting wifi to work. Passport number, seriously... Some web error prevented ultimately. Not good."
,,Basically an Exclusive Shopping Centre,2.0,,"It is fun for a short while but the ostentatiousness of the place does get to me. The gondola was a nice touch, but they are better in Venice. Fortunately there are some cheap places for a meal."
,,If you're looking for stylish premises and premium brands,4.0,,"Even in shopping-mad Singapore where there are already loads of shopping malls, the Shoppes take retail therapy to a whole new level. If you've got a fat wallet and very shallow pockets, this is certainly one the places to go looking for top-end brands in a very swankily-designed building. And if there's some plenty of change left afterwards, posh expensive restaurants are not far away to help fill one's tummy. Perhaps the only place where things might be considered 'reasonably-priced' would be the food court, but even here, prices can be a little steep."
,,It is huge....,3.0,,"The shopping mall is huge, way too big. The restaurant is expensive, the shop is also...expensive. Better be prepared, suggest to eat before/after finish shopping/gambling here......."
,,Lunch and dinner,5.0,,Great variety of restaurants. We had lunch at Coffee Bean. Reasonably priced burgers and steaks. We also has an exquisite dinner at The Cut by Wolfgang Puck. It was a good steak dinner in a nice restaurant. Service was good and attentive.
,,Poshy Shopping Venue,4.0,,"Marina Bay is one of the prettiest sights by night. It was a hive of activity with lovers canoodling, aerobics, zumba classes and lots of people running everywhere.

On entry it's pretty hard not be dazzled by this shopping centre, especially if you are used to Westfields or the like in Sydney. They hardly compare.
There is a mini river on which you can ride a gondola. Mimic? Maybe but who cares, it was cool. I was a little overwhelmed by the food court with so many cuisines and fresh seafood and I know I wanted to dine in everyone of the restaurants that looked so appealing from the outside. Seems lots of famous chefs have decided to have a restaurant here.
Its classy and posh and well worth a sticky beak."
,,"Expensive, not for us",5.0,,Cannot give a bad rating based on the price as the shopping mall is immaculately presented with small attractions and things to look at throughout the mall. For people with very expensive taste and a wallet with a little bit more than $100 in it. Apparently a lot of famous celebrities stay here :) :)
,,lovely even still,4.0,,"the shopping mall want as crowded as i thought it would be
we took a lot of time going around and exploring and finally set down for the buffet dinner at the bottom floor , it was amazing , foods of drives places , my husband and i could let go of the meat and the chocolate fountain"
,,"High-end shoppes, very affordable regional street food stalls.",5.0,,"It my and my wife's first time to be inside the shoppes, and one will see high-end products and brands - in their own shoppe. We are impressed by the Shoppes itself. Didn't realize that the Shoppes, have a very affordable food stalls located at B2-50, Canal Level of the Shoppes."
,,Extreme Shopping,5.0,,what an amazing shopping centre. such high end brands here its crazy! but it was good to see they had some budget friendly food places as well! unique experience to walk through the shops here
,,A world full of shopping dreams.....,5.0,,Marina Bay area is a huge area comprises of hundreds of activities. Life is really vibrant here. You will have everything here maintaining highest standard of living. Nice bay surrounded with flagship architectural sites and monuments of Singapore in a frame is really worthy one to visit. This area symbolizes greater advancement of Singapore towards a dream city. As newcomer we weren't very much sure about our prioritie. Suddenly decided to enter in the Marina Bay shopping area. Really the mall is huge one with many brand shops. In addition to that we found a canal somehow have similarity with canals of Venice where one can ride on boats and have photographs. Some restaurants are there. Even one casino is there. One taxi driver was pointing about the fame of this casino. This place is superbly maintained. The whole atmosphere is splendid. But you have to spend a lot for shopping here. Even price of the products tagged with sale seemed to be much higher. But you will have the essence of most important brands in the world which reminded me about 5th avenue of New York.
,,A must visit place!!,5.0,,An amazing place to be in. You can enjoy shopping for entire day. Inside the shopping mall you will see people are shopping using boats. A must go place !!
,,Extremely high level shopping centre - cheap food gallery,5.0,,"If you carry platinum card with - this and Orchard road is for you. You find every luxury brands together here. Period.
Restaurants then comes from Michelin starred to all-kinds-of-food-court. Nice cafe's as well.
Nice Place to visit for all, at least you can take a breath of luxury airconditioned air."
,,An awesome place!,5.0,,"One can spend hours here if one comes with a fully-loaded purse!!! High-end shopping,exclusive boutiques, extremely helpful sales staff all contribute making a visit to this place memorable!!!"
,,Good shopping,4.0,,"Really well set up and easy to get to with a smrt station underneath. The shopping complex is great, but prices go up as the floors do. Bottom floor more in my price range with a food court. Close to gardens by the bay and the flyer, so you can spend a whole day in the area."
,,Shopping,5.0,,Excellent shopping experience. High end shops. Excellent restaurants. Water show near the steps is a lifetime experience.
,,Good place to do window shoppinh,4.0,,"Not many people during the weekdays and thus, peaceful and quiet all round. There are cafes and eateries around the place if you may feel hungry."
,,High branded Mall,5.0,,"I think this mall is the best mall in Singapore...the design itself and many attraction inside the mall, it also connects with Marina Bay sands hotel and Garden by the bay...this mall has casino, theater, and a lot of food and shopping tenants...but the stores inside this mall mostly high branded...for budget traveller, might be not a good place for shopping..."
,,High end retail,4.0,,"The shops here require a deep deep pocket. Luxury brands abound

That said - window shopping is free and there is plenty to see here.

The mall itself if light and airy with great architecture.

The 24/7 food court offers a wide variety of food for all tastes.

Very accessible via the MRT too."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"This place is fantastic and I'm so glad we came here, everything about it was excellent, the service, the food, the attractions and the shopping all second to none."
,,Amazing shopping centre!!,3.0,,"The shopping centre is a must see, it's amazing and has so many floors, great to wander in the evening. We went to the superheroes cafe and had special ice cream shakes but be careful they are very expensive."
,,"Goldmine of Epicurean Treasures, Classic Elegance & Lux Delights",5.0,,"THE brands are there. In full glory, no less.

The complex seems bathed in an aura of wonderment. The architectural lay of the sprawling retail behemoth is excitingly enchanting. See my pics to get the feel.

A casino, an ice skating rink, celebrity culinary magic, a state of the art theatre, fantastic indoor/outdoor views, a cruising canal - all make for a surreal experience.
All nice.

Just the place to get anything one want - especially true for those with deep deep pockets."
,,Great mall,3.0,,"Visited this mall today and its a great one with all the christmass atmosphere loved the decoration, however its a bit hot inside."
,,Good mall,4.0,,That's a big stretched multi directional/ floor shopping mall You can lose your orientation easily that's why plan your visit properly
,,Huge Mall - Good for Walking Around for One Hour,4.0,,"My wife, two children and I visited Singapore in June 2016. The Marina Bay Sands is an iconic structure. The shops are a huge mall. It is a nice place to walk around for an hour but I think the prices are very expensive here. If you want to eat something, I recommend the food court."
,,So much overpriced crap in one place!,3.0,,"Massive mall full of things you can't afford. Shop after shop of high end luxury brands... But very nice for a walk around, and a meal at the food court downstairs with a large number of stalls selling all kinds of food (Quite reasonable, unlike the rest of the mall).

Do visit to round out your trip to Marina Bay."
,,This is quite a mall,4.0,,"This is a huge, beautiful mall complex located next to the famous Marina Bay Sands Hotel. There is a full range of high end shopping options and many restaurants. The food court is mainly Asian fare, but the offerings are good quality. As an interesting diversion you can have a boat ride in a canal inside the mall."
,,very modern very clean and very ex mall,4.0,,"lovely modern well kept and well set up mall.Xmas decorations were lovely,but in general very expensive shops,If you shop labels you will be in Heaven"
,,Must see,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore this is a must. A wonderful collection of designer shops in an excellent location.. Visit after dark to see the beautiful lights of Singapore and the stunning light show. What other shopping mall can boast a canal complete with boat rides and a most unusual waterfall. Even if you are not into designer shopping, this mall will impress. We were lucky enough to visit during the Christmas period so we could see all the lovely decorations and write our New Year wishes on shiny discs and place them on the special “trees” outside. Finish your evening with a boat trip to enjoy the lights and the skyline."
,,Worth a dekko...,4.0,,"Well, if you do want to go up to the observation deck, it would be worth a while to spend some time at the shopping arcade. It has super high end stores and a great opportunity for window shopping.

Rest, if you can afford it, buy something. Glamour and glitz personified."
,,A wooow mall,5.0,,"Luxury shopping mall for branded items. Your credit card will hate you. There is a casino as well as an exhibition centre in the mall. Recommended to view the bay from the rooftop as there is a water and light show in the evening (at 8pm or 9:30pm).
Get the Sands Membership for point collection when you shop, or discounted admission to attractions like ArtScience Museum, etc."
,,Nice view,3.0,,Best shopping mall with high end boutique. This Marina Bay sands mall is suitable for upper class people.
,,"Nice Views of Town, Nice Architecture",4.0,,"Marina Bay Sands is a nice architecture, looks beautiful and artistic, has got a lot of different attractions such as shopping, casino, pool (leisure) etc. However it is a very commercialized place. Good for business events but not recommended for family holidays."
,,Experience and expensive,5.0,,There was so much to see and do at mbs and these shops needed days in themselves to look around. They have all the top end fashion and jewellery stores including a Rolex shop with watches over 200k. The ice rink was cool and definitely worth a visit.
,,High end...,4.0,,"The Shoppes is a beautiful pretty well located high end and expensive mall with bunch of brands like LV, Prada and much much more. There are restaurants and bars with beautiful view to the Marina. Its an interesting mall..."
,,High end mall,4.0,,"It’s pretty much everything you expect at a high-end luxury mall. LV, Prada, Hermes, Dior, just to name a few. If high-end shopping isn’t your thing, you can always head on over to the casino or grab a bite to eat at their hawker centre (aka food court). It’s definitely way nicer than your average food court - definitely no Panda Express here! Nice to check out, but you won't miss much if you skip it.

Nice view of the Singapore skyline."
,,Marina Bay Shoppes,4.0,,Wonderful mix of shops for festive shopping and many restaurants to choose from. Very accessible by public transport.
,,Prestige Shopping,5.0,,For the ones who search for Worldwide-known designers must go to the shops at marina Bay Sands. You get almost all of them if not all.
,,Impressive,4.0,,Great shopping centre with high end shopping the overall experience is great for a rainy day . Would not recommend the Bread street Kitchen ( Gordon Ramsey) over priced and pretentious.
,,Nice Place,5.0,,"Very nice place to shop. However shops are mostly high end. There is a good food court on the ground floor near the ice skating are with wide range of choices of Asian and International Cuisine. You must try their milk tea, Laksa and Satay."
,,Perfect for shopaholic,4.0,,"In this shopping centre, there are hundreds of stores and boutiques. We can browse and purchase the latest design in many flagship stores such as Louis Vuitton, Kenzo. Besides that, we can enjoy the sampan ride, very interesting. The most exciting thing is the light and water show every night in front of the mall."
,,Very impressive,5.0,,"We loved this mall. Very spacious, beautifully laid out with wonderful sculptures and artwork. A great choice of shops. Catered more towards the high end shopper but still nice to walk around even if the prices are expensive!"
,,Good for buying luxury goods,4.0,,picked this over Orchard Road due to the density of luxury brands---meaning less walking---and the presence of air conditioning. good variety of items on sale.
,,Place to be,5.0,,"First experience and we was not disappointed Service ,Amazon ambient, very clean, wifi good shops and restaurants very well organized The price is expensive but considering you are Singapore the most beautiful in Asia Transport very efficient"
,,Big And Glitzy But Not A Lot Here,3.0,,It is an impressive area with its tall ceilings and glass walls but there really is not a great deal here if you are into serious shopping or just looking around.
,,beautiful shopping centre,4.0,,even if you don't buy anything it's worth taking a look around. there's a canal where you can ride gondolas and a really wonderful water display which I can only describe as a funnel. eating around here is more pricey than other parts of the city but that's to expected when all the stores are high end. if you're using the metro catch the train to bayfront which takes you straight to the centre.
,,"Visually impressive and big, but not really a destination",4.0,,"Yes, it's spacious and modern, but what is there to do? The restaurants are OK but not great, and it's the entrance way to the ArtScience Museum (which is worth visiting). It's above an MRT station, which is helpful because the queues for the taxi can be huge, especially at the weekend."
,,Marina Bay,3.0,,"If y ou like everything new and concrete/glass you will rate this area higher. Everything is well maintained and easy to get around. It's worth going up Marina Bay sands to the SkyBar for a drink as the building lights come on. 20S$ each for entry but you redeem against any drinks or snacks. Great views and the architecture of this building is amazing. Take the time to look inside the Fullerton Hotel. Amazing luxury.
Easy to walk to Boat Quay from here but what a let down! Avoid as we would also recommend for Clarke Quay. Poor food etc."
,,An upmarket shopping centre with great cafes and restaurants.,4.0,,We had lunch at the Toastbox café overlooking the shopping mall which has a canal running along one wing with gondolas. Well worth a visit.
,,Shopping Paradise,5.0,,Every store you can imagine is here. Every luxury brand can be found in this mall. The best thing you can do is sign up for the rewards card. You can do this for free. Stores will give you point based on how much you purchase. You can then redeem them for dollars off at most stores. It saved me a few hundred dollars over the course of 2 days of shopping. Great restaurants in this mall also. Try the dim sum for sure at Din Tai Fung.
,,Totally amazing,5.0,,"If you want to see the best of the best shops and views then this is the place, however it is over priced and you pay for where you are. Be ready to open your purse wide"
,,Expensive shops,4.0,,"A great mall to wander around, but be warned, even with the signage it is easy to become disorientated. Great views out to the bay, and plenty for everyone in the way of shops, food court and a casino."
,,Gorgeous mall but expensive shops,3.0,,"Seriously top end stuff here, lovely mall to look around but very few what I would call every day stores in most of the mall. If you want Fendi, Ferrari & Chanel this is for you but if you want affordable retail malls this is not the place. Checkout the bling, walk through to see the SuperTrees or watch their free water & light display or window shop unless you have serious cash to splash.
Worth a visit though but don't expect to find too many bargains!"
,,One of the Largest Luxury Malls In Asia,5.0,,Marina Bay houses one of the most luxurious malls in Asia.Almost every luxury brand was there as well as a huge casino. Next door were the Marina Bay gardens. If you have one day in Singapore this is the place t obe.
,,Great Shopping,5.0,,Close to where I was staying . Lots of different type of shops and prices are cheaper than at Orchard Rd. Good eating both fast food and quality resturants
,,High end shopping. One of a kind shopping experience,5.0,,"Yes it is true that MBS is a hub for luxury shopping.

It has a good array high end brands and fashion houses.

You can also marvel at this massive structure from inside or outside the shoppes.

The LV shop exudes a modern, nautical stye.

Nice Venetian- like canal and gondola happening in the lower floor.

Food options provide staples like in hawker centers.

A worthwhile visit not only for shopping but for experiencing this awesome tourist hub.

End the day by viewing the fountain/ audio video show in the evening."
,,Tourist,5.0,,Plenty of shops and great restaurants. The Casino is Located in this area. Well worth a look at as is the water feature in the shopping centre.
,,Stunning but expensive,4.0,,"This is a stunning shopping mall with prices to match. Mainly high end brands but it is still good to window shop if you don't have the money to make a purchase.
Tip - there is a cheapish food court in the basement near the art science centre, the other sparsely scartered cafes are very expensive."
,,Shoppers paradise,5.0,,"If you like shopping you will not be disappointed, marina bay has every shop you can think off and more. Take your credit cards and prepare to come out with plenty of bags. Set in a beautiful location, it's a must for Singapore"
,,A Smorgasbord Of Shops,5.0,,"A shoppers paradise with a Smorgasbord Of Shops ranging from basic to high end stores set in plush surroundings, Well worth a browse."
,,Lots of shops not much to buy,3.0,,"Well designed, quiet and comfortable. Enjoyed a favourite dumpling chain - Din Tai Fung. Great window shopping. Its a shame that the shopping experience was not very exciting, same expensive chain stock you would get on Orchard Road only a third of the choice."
,,Window Shoppers Delight,4.0,,"The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands is a really big shopping centre with every expensive big name brand that you could think of. For most of us, prices are out of our league but a visit to window shop can be an experience. Aside from the brand shops, there are numerous food options and some are reasonably priced."
,,Opulent,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands is a modern marina with modern skyscraping architecture- a bit like Dubai/ Las Vegas and Brisbane. The mall is full of high end labels such as Dior, Chanel etc and restaurants like Gordon Ramsay's place. It's a really nice place to hang out on the steps and people watch. The bay's gorgeous- you can also do boat trips etc."
,,Wow,5.0,,Every brand you ever dreamed of in the one place. Bring lots of money or just window sop and dream. Can get good bargains in some shops when having a sale.
,,"Most will only ""window shop""",5.0,,"From a personal perspective I would give this a ""terrible"" score but I'm sure that other people will love it. There is every kind of shop that you can think of. None of them cheap. The busiest shop was the 7.11 ! None of the stuff is cheap. But hey if you've got it then flaunt it !"
,,Little Venice in the Mall,4.0,,"When you come to the Shopped at Marina Bay Sands, you should go down to level B2 because there is few gondolas and also you can ride those gondola with around SGD 10 but only for certain time ( you should check those time first)."
,,Just awesome,4.0,,"This place is awesome, in the traditional sense of the word. You will be amazed at the sheer size and the looks of the whole place. They even have an ice skating rink. In the evening, be sure to check out the water show at the outside of the building, which is really amazing."
,,Lovely place,5.0,,"A nice place, interesting place, huge place where I think you can find almost anything here (did not manage to stroll the whole complex).. branded stores to regular one, amazing resto and cafe, casino. My nephew enjoyed her moment on the garden area.."
,,Shopping Therapy,4.0,,"As the saying goes, shop until you drop when in Singapore. This large indoor shopping did not disappoint, plenty of designer shops, foodcourt, restaurants, canal, you name it, you got it here at this indoor mall. Special features include the Perspex water bowl fountain thing, the canal where one can take small boat trips and of course the food outlets. Also some nice outdoor seating areas. Linked to the famous Marine Bay Sands Hotel. Well worth a visit for an all day or a few hours of shopping therapy. Oh and it's a Pokemon magnet especially for catching sone rare specimen so I'm told..."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Absolutely beautiful. Did the Gondola ride for a bit of fun and strolled through the shops. The shopping is gourmet so take your plastic but a pleasure. If you go to the Casino, remember to take your Passport."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"I really love the architecture in Singapore and whilst walking towards the Marina Bay Sands area, we are just given a spectacular view of the breathtaking scenery. Upon entering the Shoppes at Marina Bay, we are greeted with a really beautiful skyline and also how they have used glass curtain walls to showcase the view outside. The shops and eateries here are not for those strapped on cash but the have the 'Gong Cha' outlet here where one can quench your thirst without bursting your pocket. 7-Eleven is also next door and Gordon Ramsey's outlet is also here. Phew, a must visit for those around the area!"
,,All the luxury shopping you can stand,5.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands resort offers pretty much all the luxury shopping that anyone can hope to handle. It is all indoors, all air conditioned, all top design, and on multiple levels.

The shopping is naturally aimed towards the more high end patrons, but if you go around the end of June or the beginning of July, you can hit the big national sales that affect the Marina Bay as well. You still won't get anything for Cheap as such, but you will get considerably more designer bang for your buck.

The layout can be a slight pain in the behind when you are going for a specific store, thanks to the massive scale of the place. If you're not used to a bit of walking, you can really have too much of a good thing here.

Still, there are also places to sit down and eat or have a bit of coffee, so if you want to make a day of it, or two, perhaps three, you certainly can. It's definitely a good option for extra hot or rainy days, when you don't want to brave Orchid Road."
,,One Stop Shop,4.0,,"High end brands, kids brands, restaurants - celebrity and not so celebrity, a dead ice rink, a gondola through the middle, great aircon, big, super hero cafe, theatre, casino and a little supermarket in a nutshell. No free wi-fi ( unless you carry your original passport with you). A must see if you are visiting to say you've seen it."
,,Massive and likely to get lost,4.0,,"This is a massive mall and has literally most of global high street and luxury brands all under 1 roof, about 2-3 orchard road malls combined . The price for this is the tremendous amount of walking needed to navigate the confusing spines and sections of the mall. It also houses the theatre, is next to the convention centre and also next to art science museum. Plenty of celebrity restaurants here - wake ghin, cut, bread street kitchen etc. And of course, the casino if you want to part with your money"
,,Fantastic Area for Walking & Shopping,4.0,,It's great shopping mall with many shops under one glass roof good for all ages there is nice fountain with small river for good trip for kids
,,Great designer shops for kids,4.0,,"The mall at Marina Bay is a great place to walk if you want to get out of the heat for a while. Many of the high end designers have kids shops here, so it is fun window shopping. The superhero cafe is the place to go for all things superhero -- t-shirts and running shoes, souvenirs, sandwiches with superhero logos blazed onto them, and superhero icecream and cakes too. Of course there were high end stores for adults too, as well as a number of restaurants (eg Daniel Boulud)."
,,World Class Shopping,5.0,,Truly one of the best shopping centres ever. From the moment you walk in it is obvious that everything at Marina Bay Sands was designed to knock your socks off. And it does not disappoint! High end all the way. Shopping - AMAZING! Atmosphere - AMAZING! You could easily spend all day here.
,,High End Brands,5.0,,"This is where we spent our last day in Singapore, its also where we bought the most. Prices weren't too bad for what we were chasing.

Its another huge centre to walk around, we didn't even cover it all.

We went back twice, and each time had to visit the food hall - yum yum yum. Once you find a table that is.

We were staying in the hotel, so enjoyed abit of a discount at some shops also.

Love the water fall in the middle, and the gondolas that pass by. A beautiful place."
,,Family visit,4.0,,"The mall is part of MBS which includes casino, hotel, MICE, restaurants and sky garden.
The mall shops are all the global high brand which attracts tourists for the high end items.
There are also good restaurants for food lovers. Whether it is western, Japanese or Chinese foods, there are many for you to choose. You can take your time to shop and there many chairs for you to take rest during your shopping therapy."
,,All the High End Brands you can think of... and more!!,5.0,,"For those of us who are not rich and famous, this place is simply worth a look to see how they shop!! All the brands you see in Vogue, Elle, Harper's Bazaar etc are here, as are the ones you haven't even heard of!! No price tags on anything in the windows here!!
Its a great place to do a bit of window shopping and get out of the heat outside.
And if you fancy a little boat ride, it also has a indoor canal for that too. You can wave above to the lovely folk sipping their tea at TWG as you pass underneath.
Din Tai Fung dumplings are worth trying if your feeling peckish. Pricey though, like everything else in the mall."
,,Big Shopping Area with Various High End Shops,4.0,,"This is a big shopping area with various high end shops.

Has shops that range from restaurants to clothes and jewelries.

The place is well air conditioned to hide away from the hot temperature in the afternoon.

It is clean and bright with lots of natural lights."
,,Good and Huge,4.0,,"Visited this place on a Monday evening and its pretty empty. There's lots of high end shops here as well as restaurant for one to take a break from shopping. There's currently more pokemon hunters than shoppers. So, if you are a shopper, am sure the retailers will be extremely glad to welcome you into their shops."
,,fashion magazine in real life,5.0,,"Any brands you'll see in Vogue/W will most likely be covered here. Immaculate clean window displays of the latest offers. Separate lines for local and foreign visitors at the casino and there was a line on a weekday morning for the visitors so I didn't bother to take a look inside. Kids can go crazy just running around in the wide walkways (though of course not recommended). It's very comfortable with some natural light shining in. There's also a man made canal if you will for the tired family with kids who want something new. Unfortunately no free wifi here.

For big purchases, there's something of a rewards program for the shopping complex that allows for an additional rebate back on top of tax free refund. Ask shop associates for more details, it seems to vary with the amount you're going to buy."
,,"Modern, luxury and wide shopping mall",5.0,,"This place is amazing. It is very wide so you can walk easily around without bumping to others. There are many high end retailers and designer shops. The building has many sections with nice structure and modern design. It is exactly above the BayFront MRT.

You can also find selections of fine dining restaurants and even food courts here. Great place to shopping and relax. The view at the front entrance was nice. There are water lightshow in the evening too.

However if you looking for cheap products and fast foods, this is not the place to go."
,,Your regular upmarket shopping mall.,4.0,,"The shoppes is a nice up market shopping centre with all the designer shops and restaurants. Although I found shopping in Singapore more expensive than UK or Dubai so I wasn't much interested in buying anything but it was a good day out. There's a Sampan ride there which is nice for couples, children under 2 are not allowed on it. Unfortunately the infinity pool is only for the residents of the hotel so we didn't see that.

The best thing about it was the DC super heroes cafe. I totally loved it."
,,Great Shops,5.0,,"My wife and I shop here a lot, good high quality shops and great food. There is a huge variety of restaurants and cheap eats. One of the best shopping malls in Singapore."
,,high end shopping complex,4.0,,"Huge mall with high end fashion stores and great place to find famous restaurants including ones by Chef Gordon Ramsay, Din Tai Fung, etc. There is a connection to Marina Bay Sands and not far from Garden by the Bay. Great place to visit with everything from shopping to restaurants!"
,,Wow!!!!!,4.0,,"What a magnificent shopping centre! From the stunning shop fronts to the gondola rides in the middle of the shops, this centre is truly breathtaking. Be prepared to spend some serious cash though as it is predominantly high end designer labels but if you're on a budget, go window shopping like me! Still worth a look!"
,,yearly trips,5.0,,"its a. huge mall and nice resto,me and my wife meet ourt nephew n wife and treat us to dinner at redpan... a very good bistro and resto.bar.nice food i may say.beer also is nice serve in tall chilled glass."
,,Big Brands,3.0,,"If you're a sucker for big brand items, this is the place to spend your money.
Fancy names are found here so you can wear some designer clothes or carry some designer bag or eat some world glass gourmet.
Most are window shopping, even though the mall tries to encourage with frequent visitor points.
Average joes will not afford most items here. But window shopping and seeing others with big bags of expensive wear is nice. At least somebody is spending.

The rest of us, watch in awe."
,,A to Z of World's Fasion Brands,4.0,,"The extensive shopping mall, which is part of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, is an A to Z of the world's most famous Fasion brands.

From Armani, Balenciaga, Calvin Klein and Daniel Hechter through to Versace, Yves Saint Laurent to Ziggy Chen, the Shoppes at Marina Sands has it all.

It makes for fascinating ""window shopping"" for us mere mortals who don't
have a spare thousand dollars or two to splurge on a pair of shoes, a pen or a handbag.

But keep walking on the ground floor past all these super rich shops and you come to an excellent food court where there is a wide selection of Singaporean, Malay, Indonesiam, Thai, Vietnamese and other Asian food stalls, and some western food, all at a fraction of the cost you would pay at one of the super star restaurants in other parts of the building."
,,Large mall with all brands under one roof,4.0,,"A big shopping Mall with all branded Stores, Casino, Concert hall . Very good restaurants and Ice Skating as well."
,,Unique,4.0,,"Visited as a stop over before seeing Gardens by the Bay and it was worthwhile. Many high class brands such as Burburry, Cartier and Tiffany's to supermarket Cold Storage and a hundred in between. Lovely view across river to city and much more"
,,Best Brands in the World.,5.0,,"Shoppers at Marina Bay Sands is the place where one can find all major and best brands in the world like Louis vuitton, Ferrari, Channel and many many more.
Located in Marina Bay Area and adjacent to Marina Bay Sands this one is must visit place when you visit Singapore.
Lot of food shops below, convention centre, cafes and many shops.
Lots of excitement"
,,Huge Mall,5.0,,All the well known brand is in the mall and it is connected to Casino. A great way to spend your money and time if you got lucky in the Casino.. haha
,,Lovely shopping experience,5.0,,Lovely shopping centre to walk around. Some very expensive shops. You can go onto the roof top for views.
,,Great place to get away,5.0,,Lots of food and shopping. Casino is huge. I especially enjoyed watching people walk around with their heads buried in their phones. Very annoying
,,Popular place to visit,5.0,,"A must when visiting Singapore. A range of dining options, casino, museum, kids activities and great shopping. Everything is so clean!"
,,A very big mall,4.0,,A very spacious mall with so many choices. Glad to see that I can visit here most of the expensive European brands. Im just having a problem finding the exit because this is a very big mall
,,Attractive luxury,5.0,,"Huge mall with lots of quality shops! World famous brands all present in this mall! Apart from shops beauty, the mall itself is very nice, having also a small river crossed by boats like in Venice. Nice restaurants and cafes are also available!"
,,Avoid the skating rink!,1.0,,"This review is with regards to the skating rink only! We have to thank the attendant who warned us that this activity would be a difficult on a plastic (not ice) surface, but we had time to burn and decided to go ahead with it anyway.

The skating surface is plastic but the skates are ice skates. The surface actually does not provide enough friction for you to push off on your back foot and gain continuous forward momentum. You can literally slide the blade of your ice skate in all directions with ease - including sideways (i.e. In a direction perpendicular to the blade) which makes it impossible and probably dangerous to skate away from the rail. The best you can manage is basically to shuffle around.

We should have known because there was literally no one else skating - and every time we have passed the rink in the last two days it's been completely empty!

Maybe this space would be better utilized as a roller skating rink but at this point in time it certainly doesn't serve its advertised purpose. A pretty disappointing $10 gone to waste."
,,Cool architecture,3.0,,Very interesting architecture and view of the bay. Many high end shops. Unfortunately these are the same brands you see in any major city in the world. Did not make me want to shop.
,,"For looking, not shopping",3.0,,"If you can actually afford to shop at these places, you probably don't need to be on this website. Nice to walk around, but yeah..... it's frigging expensive."
,,Most Fashion Designers in One Mall,4.0,,"Multi-story mall between Marina Bay and the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Every fashion designer imaginable. Very pricey. Lots of restaurants also, including several celebrity chefs (Ramsay, Batali, etc). Worth a walk through for anyone not native to Singapore, but don't plan to purchase much unless you have lots of discretionary income."
,,Marina Bay shopping and lunch,5.0,,"Our family live in Singapore so we visit quite often from New Zealand. The shopping is 'to die for' there with all the designer shops and much more, plenty of places to eat or have a drink, lovely theatre, gondola rides on the Venice type canal and ice skating rink. We had lunch at Carnivore Brazilian Churrascaria where for one price you can eat as much of many different meats as you can with various salads. Our 8 yr old grandson beat the lot of us. Amazing value."
,,The best of everything,5.0,,"The Shoppes at Marina Bay, Singapore, is the closest I've come to running the gauntlet. Every designer label and every upmarket product is here. Lock up your credit cards!

The building is a destination in itself. How many shopping centres have their own canal with gondola rides?

Lots of classy eateries but for the budget-conscious there is a fabulous food court featuring a great selection of Asian and other delicacies.

The Shoppes is a 'must' for visitors to Singapore."
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,"A wonderful place to visit with plenty of brand name shopping and site seeing. The place has few events for children too. You can enjoy late night shopping any day of the week . It is one of Singapore’s largest luxury shopping malls, you will find a refreshing mix of international luxury brands and emerging labels in runway and street style. The Gondola ride is a must as kids love that and is much cheaper compared to Macau - the Venetian. You can also take short walk to the Marina bay gardens and the Merlion.
There is another mall called Marina Square that is also great place for shopping with standard items and reasonable prices."
,,The Best Mall in the world! Gotta have the budget for it though...,5.0,,"Here you can find anything you need and even have a great lunch with the amazing options they have in the mall. Air conditioned, all closed in, accessible by metro, all brand names and quality shopping. You do need a good budget, so if you have the cash and want to go shipping, this is the mall to go. Beautiful place."
,,An upper class place,5.0,,A great place to visit even if it is just to see how the other half shop.Like the rest of Singapore spotlessy clean.While down that way went to the casino.Visitors should be aware you are required to show your passport or pay to enter.Dress code is pretty easy and smart casual is acceptable.If you dont smoke go upstairs as it is non smoking.Fairly good food court in the complex besides other dining choices.
,,Nice to spend some hours...,5.0,,"Great architecture, amazing atmosphere! Walking along the promenade and enjoy the spirit. Several bars invite for coffee or a beer...Shoppes - luxary mall has it all, and the skydeck a fantastic place to grab a drink in the evening!"
,,Just enjoy your walk and forget the wallet,5.0,,"mall building is very, very large . comfortable enough to walk way and wash the eyes with well-known branded goods . quite enjoy it without spending for goods sold is an expensive item . one of her mall which has its own artificial waterfall and small stream that can be passed with boats . such as artificial venice ."
,,Beautiful building but not for the casual shopper!,4.0,,"Loved visiting here, walking around in the cool air conditioning surrounded by huge Windows and beautiful architecture shopping here is not realistic for us, only big brand bunnies! The food court was great though plenty of good cheaper eats here, lots of space to sit and get a fresh juice!"
,,Marina Bay,5.0,,"Impresive building, eyecatcher! Interesting shops with lots of variaties. Part of Singapore you must not miss! Come back for sure!"
,,Leave your wallet at home...,5.0,,"That is exactly what I did. Judging by the way my wife's mouth was salivating, it looks like I did the right thing otherwise it would be a bankrupt writing this review. Here, you will find pretty much every luxury brand going - from LV to Gucci to Rolex - at prices that would suit those who have just matched six numbers! Still, it is worth doing the window shopping. As they say...happy wife; happy life!!"
,,"Living in 2100, the future!",5.0,,"Marina Bay is a must visit due to the incredible design of the building which hosts high end retail stores, restaurants, casino, hotel and an epic roof top pool. No trip to Singapore should be had without a visit to MBS.

Make a reservation at Wolfgang Puck's Spago for a rooftop dining experience you won't forget anytime soon. Try the lamb rack or veal soaked in goats milk - amazing!"
,,Walking around is a pleasure,4.0,,"This place is no doubt for the bold and rich people not for ordinary people. Yes, we can freely walk and enjoy window shopping to our heart's content. Lovely atmosphere, glittering shops and walkways, luxury items all around, sparkling clean and cool place. Nice place to cool down in the lobby. I love the place. The boat ride inside the malls are also expensive. So, I just enjoy watching others ride. One needs strong feet to walk around the malls which are quite spread out."
,,Short stop,3.0,,Went to the mall for dinner and after that a short walk. Mostly branded goods it has many restaurants available. However you must be prepared to burn a whole in your pocket if you go there shopping or having a meal as the price is definitely above the usual mall.
,,luxury marina bay,4.0,,"well marina bay is for those person who are casino lover and loves popular costly brands , you can find brands shops , in the ground floor there many good resturant cost from 7 to 10 $ food , there isnt much to enjoy , foreigner can go casino without paying anything , show your passport at entry of casino , go in and try your luck , the bet start from minmum 5 $ and goes upto higher ."
,,Casual visit,4.0,,"It's an well maintained shopping, amusement, casino, restaurant space. What can I say it's a sum total of all and is a very nice experience"
,,I don’t know why?,3.0,,My wife likes to shop and I don’t. On our vacations I run her through many sightseeing adventures so I have to put up with a bit of shopping. I still don’t know why she wanted to come here though. The prices were astronomical. I did enjoy the very sterile environment and the beautiful temps that vastly differed from the evening temps outside though. We didn’t buy anything but we window shopped and at the end my wife was a little depressed that she couldn’t find anything of significance in our budget.
,,Luxury shops,5.0,,"Luxury shopping at its finest. Great big names shopping. Good restaurants and a big food court. Be aware that most dining places close by 10, so be prepared to dine before heading to the different outdoor shows. Loved the promenade at the front with the water show."
,,Copy of Venetian in Vegas but cannot compare,2.0,,"Is a copy of the Venetian in Las Vegas. It just does not do it for me with its small river. Lots of high end shops, restaurants and bars. Outside decking area and close to the Marina and Esplanade"
,,Great place to visit but expensive to buy.,4.0,,"Many different shops, next to the casino and the hotel. Merchandise is a bit pricier than the other places but they're located in a luxury, air-conditioned, environment. Great place to stroll if raining.You can even ride a gondola if you so desire."
,,Good for roaming around and for food!,5.0,,"Not very huge,thats convinient.Really pretty mall,but most just do window shopping,as shops might get expensive.Restuarants are amazing,including Pita Pan and Osteria Mozza.This has a direct walkway to the Gardens by the Bay.Really beautiful views from here,of the entire skyline and of the gorgeous Marina Bay Sands hotel building.Good way to spend half a day."
,,Money laundry in Singapore,3.0,,"What can be more disgusting that endless one-named luxury boutiques catering to the filthy rich oligarchs and thieves ripping off impoverished countries in Southeast Asia? Go see the glitzy pristine mall and marvel at the little Chinese kids wearing Nike shoes that cost more than a primary education for the less well connected citizens back home. Take a barf bag, it's disgusting."
,,Shoppers paradise,3.0,,I am not a shopper so can think of nothing worse than the extensive inter-linked area of shopping arcades provided here. But there are great inexpensive eating spaces that I greatly enjoyed though finding your way around can be a challenge!
,,Fun day! But why does my wallet feel so light?,4.0,,"I really enjoyed my time at this shopping center on my 2 day stop over in Singapore. The shops were very nice to look at and the food places I went to were delicious! They also have other fun things to do in the mall such as boat rides and ice skating.

However, a majority of these shops are VERY expensive (as Singapore is). Another thing which slightly annoyed me was how I went to shops which were way less expensive on their websites or other shops. For example, Sephora a cosmetics store. This store had a $60 dollar item which happened to only be $28 dollars at the airport, which I sadly brought at the Marina bay mall :(.

The point is, its a very fun and cool place to go. But don't expect really good sales, as this place is filled with more high end clothing! A must-go to though, if you are a shopoholic like me! :D"
,,Great watching rich shop,4.0,,Most enjoyable hour or so window shopping beautiful shops and their clientele. Food hall good with all cuisines covered. Next door to the very awesome and essential tourist stop the Art Science museum.
,,Wide selection of designer brands at competitive prices,4.0,,If shopping is your thing then this centre is well laid out and has a wide selection of shops (no electronics shops though)
,,Looking around,5.0,,"These shops are three stories high and there are 100's of them. Most of the shops are very high end and things are quite expensive including meals (4 lemonades and a bowl of chips was nearly $40!), but really lovely to look around never the less."
,,Luxury shopping mall,5.0,,"Quality shops, soaring dome like ceiling, large food court, spacious concourses, interesting whirlpool water feature and beautiful outlook onto the bay. This mall has stunning architecture and is a great place to spend a few hours shopping and dining while in Singapore."
,,Need to be improved to a luxury shopping mall.,2.0,,"The MBS staffs are not that friendly...... The toilets are very terrible, I can't image they are in a 'luxury' shopping mall in Singapore.
There are not much brands like Orchard area.

The only things I feel good that the luxury brands staffs are good and polite, they are very helpful (I will say more than MBS staffs), so do those luxury brands are beautiful.

And the night view outside of MBS building, I enjoyed it."
,,One stop mall,4.0,,"This mall is quite different compare with others. A casino, a broadway style theatre, huge expo venue and lastly a small river for boat cruising inside the mall, my kids love it."
,,"Shopping, food, views, gambling and good spots for selfies",3.0,,"If you're into food, luxury shopping and taking selfies, then check out Marina Bay Sands. It's located outside the city centre of Orchard Road but it's a nice outing - especially on rainy days as you can wander around for hours. This is where the only city casino is located - so if that's your thing then have a whirl. There are outlets for all the major international luxury brands - including the award-winning Louis Vuitton Island Maison which is located in a stand-alone glass cube on the water that you can access via an underground tunnel; it's worth checking out if you're into architecture. You can also access the now iconic 'boat on stilts' venue of the MBS skypark (which is on top of the three 'legs' of the hotel building) where a number of videos and films have been made - although it's usually crazy busy during normal hours. There's not a lot of 'culture' here however. It really a bubble of commerce, but if that's your thing then check it out :)"
,,Amazing Shopping Experience,5.0,,A huge truly architecturally attractive shopping mall. Every conceivable designer brand is in this mall. Easy to get around and connects to the hotel. Bathroom facilities are also 5 Star. I recommend a visit just to look around. Also has a great view over the marina area from top floor.
,,Just to see,5.0,,"This mall is a place where you can find all luxurious brands, even if it is not your plan to buy sone expensive items i think it is worth to take a walk around if you are in Singapore, being i the marina bay sands hotel makes it a must go also, you can cone here and then take a walk through the marina bay. It has a very easy access by subway, i do not remember which station it is but if you ask the workers of the subway for sure they will help you."
,,Soothing to the eyes,4.0,,"Is this mainly for window-shoppers? Yes!!! Most wallet wont afford to buy anything from this mall but it can sooth your eyes, you get to see what money can buy, so many high-end stores, you almost feel embarrassed to enter. But you must visit.."
,,Overrated and expensive,2.0,,Not much good to say about this shopping mall. It is expensive with a rather mediocre food court. The indoor ice skating ring was out of order.
,,Window shopping,4.0,,This shopping mall is worth a visit even if you don't plan to by any luxury items. In addition to luxury boutiques the mall includes an ice rink for skating and an indoors river with rowboats. It's also worth to visit the bar at the 57th floor of tower 3 of the Marina Bay Sands hotel. The views are really fabulous.
,,Top quality shopping,5.0,,This is a fantastic shopping centre. There any many floors and high quality shops. The Venetian canal was a nice touch. This is a shopping area that I would revisit when in Singapore again.
,,Shopping heaven,5.0,,Every designer shop you could wish for! Food and drink also The nearby art and science museum worth a visit
,,Great for window shopping!,5.0,,"The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands is a high end shopping experience. I did not see many people inside the luxury shops but few, like me, looking at the displays in the windows. Beautiful restaurants, coffee shops, casino, impressive inverted water fountain 'Rain Oculus', canals with boats and ice skating rink, what else do you need? Lots of money!"
,,An Afternoon @ MBS,4.0,,"Visited Shoppes at Marina Bay Sand. An upmarket shopping mall linked to Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Nearest MRT is Bayfront Station.

Spent an evening shopping and dining there. Mostly are upmarket fashion boutiques, watch boutiques, jewellers, cafes, restaurants, food court, etc. There's also the more affordable trendy fashion boutiques too. Relaxed and had tea at TWG cafe while watching the gondola cruising by."
,,Non-Stop Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands,5.0,,"The timing couldn't have been perfect. And it only proves that women, my wife is one, have a nose for shops. The Great Singapore Sale (GSS) was happening when we went to visit the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands. So, like seasoned topnotch athletes, we surveyed the length and breadth of the mall. I could still hear the daring: on your mark, set, shop!

First stop was the Prada store. After all the selection, my wife finally got a bag. And despite the advertised sale, it still cost me an arm and a leg.

Second stop, my turn. A sports shop. I scored a pair of Adidas ultraboost trainers difficult to find in the philippines and it was fantastic.

Third, she entered a bath, soap and essential oils and fragrance shop. The place was pleasantly smelling. She got colognes and scented candles to last until Christmas, next year!

Fourth, she saw the Cold Storage supermarket and she made last minutes spices purchase.

The fine selection of shops and high end stores leaves a shopper breathless and the wallet depressed or the credit card maxed out. But it is a great mall, with all the generous appointments, art, architecture and texture, and generally an ease with which one acquires things or how one parts with one's cash or credit. The shops have GST to claim at the airport upon leaving the city.

The skyline that dominates the outside of the mall up to the ArtScience Museum are pleasing bonuses. This spot makes for perfect selfies. This mall is spotless, odorless, and has an openness that welcomes all to see, select and score a sale, to hapless husbands like me, who just wants a drink at the joints that abound in this mall.

My wife mimicked Gen Douglas MacArthur who in the days of World War II uttered the immortal lines: I shall return!"
,,Great place for the masses,3.0,,"Excellent t view from the roof accompanied by u accessory loud music through the speakers.
Disappointing to see so many crass people walking around in hotel bathrobes and room slippers despite signs telling guests not to do it! The mere fact they needed to post the signs tells you alot about their clientele.
The eateries seem to cater for the masses, I guess they have to with so many rooms, what's the opposite to intimate, well that's it. My advice is go to the top and take in the view, then go somewhere else for a drink and dinner."
,,Beautiful Complex,5.0,,"There are countless beautiful stores to shop in, excellent restaurants for delicious meals, interesting walkways, and beautiful Christmas decorations all over and great views from the upper levels. It's a wonderful complex to explore."
,,You don't have to be rich to 'experience' this ultra luxurious high end mall.....,5.0,,"The minute one steps into this ""one of a kind here"" mall; one can immediately ""see & feel"" the awesome, ultra luxurious ambience of this big, beautifully designed, hugely spacious & very expensive retail mall.

Every imaginable international super high end brands 'stares' at you from all sides of the mall, on every floor. Amazing ambience! We loved coming here.

You don't have to be rich to come here. Come here just for the experience. This mall is part of a much larger Marina Bay Integrated Resort with its unique Surfboard top-linked 3 towers Hotel, a casino & and an Art Science Museum.
And the amazing Gardens by The Bay is just next to it. Too good to miss!"
,,"Marina Bay, Singapore",4.0,,"I suggest to people who are interested in architecture and modern design to come here. Take your time to walk around + don't rush about too much.

Marina Bay is an amazing place worthy of your time and dedicated attention.

There are a wide choice of different restaurants and eateries inside the mall to cater to all taste and purse. A good 2-3 hours should be spent to really appreciate the area."
,,A place busy with life!,5.0,,"This place is a shopping wonderland for luxury hunters. Big brands are everywhere, and the amount of shopping mega buildings are never ending. Do remember to bring along portable charger, a good wifi-data prepaid plan, good shoes and some form of entertainment if you are bringing along your girlfriend, wife or daughter. They will enjoy themselves alot, there are plenty of chairs to rest while guarding the shopping hoots."
,,Las Vegas style hotel complex,3.0,,"The ""hotel"" shopping - casino and meeting complex is gigantic.
For me it missing any charm - character or hotel feeling, its to huge and reminds me of some hotels in Vegas, just money spinning machines no atmosphere, end of the day your are just a number.
Nice for some, not for me."
,,You will need a bundle of cash at this place,4.0,,"Well if you want top end shopping this is it, if you are after a bargain then it is not. This is only for the wealthy and the less fortunate to dream of. 3 floors of shops but all expensive. Tip for the drinkers, lower level visit the cold store, cheap beer and wine and wide range of food available, best prices locally."
,,Amazing,5.0,,I was in designer heaven Every designer shop you could imagine was here Seemed like miles of shops to choose from And a lot had great sales happening Beautiful places to eat and have a rest from the shopping Went away with many wonderful purchases
,,Super shopping mall,4.0,,"Really nice mall with mixture of brands, although with most in upper pricerange. Nice restaurangs, recommend Din Tai Fung especially!"
,,Huge..,4.0,,"Big shopping mall is designed by glass roof which is eco friendly. Clean, neat and spacy walking areas. Luxurious shops with creative window display never fail to amaze us. Enough and clean wash rooms are there."
,,Singapore in a nutshell! Wow!,5.0,,"An expanse of shops, restaurants and a casino awaits you at the magnificent Marina Bay Sands building. You can spend days here, in the shops or at the food court."
,,Shopping,4.0,,"Large mall with many shops with connection to the Marina Bay Sands casino. There are a lot of cafes and restaurants. Not worth special attention, but if you're in the casino you can visit it .Most interesting is the artificial ice rink ..."
,,Nice place to walk around,5.0,,"By chance I had stayed in marina bay sands then I found the lane to walk to this mall.

Majority of shops are really luxury selected ship however there is a supermarket as well. It was very convenient for me besides busy short trip if I want to grab something in my suit case or small gift etc.

I found quite many things for children as well. Next time I would like to take my niece for fun!"
,,big mall with many famous and branded store,5.0,,"Its a big mall, that connect into garden by the bay, near esplanade and helix bridge.

If your over 5.10 in my case 6'4 & let's say to be kind, enjoy ur life 'don't bother.' ...
If u have size 11 up feet you can

,,Inspirational spot for interesting window displays,4.0,,"The water feature and constant sound of water wave made the atmosphere calming, suitable for those who want to shop at a slower pace."
,,Luxury shopping,5.0,,If you need to ask how much something is then you probably can't afford it Go at night and watch the free water and light show in the Bay
,,Good Place for window shopping,4.0,,"The place as all the high end brands that you can think of. There is a food court at one corner which food from all over the world although the quality is something that left a lot to be desired . .. but then it;s a food court :)
There are some fine dine restraunts which are good and some good places for breakfast . It has at least a couple of TWG cafe's which are good options for a light snack and to try out some great tea :)"
,,High end shopping mall,5.0,,"If you like branded things, here is the place. All brands can be find here. Besides, you can enjoy scenic view of Singapore CBD outside the mall."
,,Break out the Credit Card,4.0,,"If you have some cash to throw around then you will LOVE The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands. There are some amazing shops to look at, all the high end brands you could possibly think of. Not only shopping there are some great restaurants. I would just recommend you try booking if there is somewhere particular you want to go."
,,Nice shops no people,2.0,,It has all the luxury brand but no one around. Service in each shop we went in was poor. Maybe i should have dressed up so they can service me better!!! Just had no atmosphere. Nice modern shopping centre.
,,Get your luxury fix,5.0,,This wonderful spot right on the river is both tranquil and spectacular. Venture into the mall and you can feel your credit card quiver with all the high end shops offering their wonderful products
,,Not bad to get food n air cond after outdoors,3.0,,The shops r a little on the pricy side. Food court would be a good place to have a reasonably priced meal but it's super crowded. There's a DC COMIC cafe and it's quite big.
,,Terrible restrooms,2.0,,"The shops and the mall in general are nice, but some of the toilets are just holes in the ground! This does fit a modern luxury mall."

,,Luxury brands and a large airy mall,5.0,,"It is worth a stop to visit and shop inside the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands.

Full of high end stores and restaurants, one of the nicest places to shop in Singapore."
,,Best of Luxury Brands in one comfortable place,5.0,,"If you Like LV, Gucci, Armani, Boss, Bally, Burberry and the likes, this place is for you. The LV island is amazing, the best Louis Vuitton store I believe in the world. Great Restaurants and our daughter enjoyed the sampan."
,,I thought i was in dubai,5.0,,"Mall, casino, hotel -an all in 1 world class beauty.
Boasting all the most luxurious international brands, glamourous eating, slow boat ride on the indoor canal.
For the rich and famous! *no fast food here by the way, closest macdonald's is at gardens by the bay!*
Walk from Marina bay through the helix bridge - amazing infrastructure!"
,,Lots to see and do in the area,4.0,,"The mall is a great break from the heat. You can also grab lunch. If you want to shop in a high-end store and it is not here, it is VERY hard to find! The views are GREAT. Also, in the evening, there is a GREAT show on the water. Enjoy!"
,,Holiday 201,4.0,,"Marina Bay if you love shopping go there during the day you at least need 4to5 hrs to take everything in ,once you've had enough of the shops its time to eat there are numerous restaurants to choose or as we did go to the food where you can sample all different foods ."
,,Watch out for aggressive touts selling skin care products in this mall.,3.0,,Amazing shopping mall but the experience is poor given the aggressive touts that following you wanting to hand you a 'free gift' then won't let go of you until you've had the 'sales pitch'. Really lowers the tone of this shopping mall.
,,Great shopping under one roof,5.0,,"Love to shop at MBS, with all luxury brand under one roof and TOP restaurant within , shop without having to go out of the building. Crowded at times."
,,WOW Marina Bay,5.0,,"What a place, from the water feature in the middle to the shops awesome. Famous shops GUCCI, YVES ST LAURENT you name it they're there. A few bargains but not at those high class shops but worth a look.. Lots of eateries usually pretty full. There are other shops for bargain hunters. but just the look of this place is incredible."
,,Great place and upmarket place,5.0,,"Great place to upmarket shopping . Huge malls,hotels and business offices. Good place to take walk during evenings. During weekdays the place is very claim after 9:30 pm/ Must go for all the people who go to Singapore"
,,"Nice area with a good view, nice museum, great mall, and a beatutiful hotel",5.0,,"A place you must visit if you are in Singapore.

Just underneith the hotell overwatching the bay."
,,Lazor Shows,5.0,,"The well built Mall and the brands from all over the world under one roof, the Lazor show is a story of its own. a must go !"
,,Worth a Visit,4.0,,Quite a happening place in Singapore. We felt the place to be quite lively and enjoyable with the family. Food available of all varieties.
,,"Woohooo, happy days!",4.0,,"Often been to singapore on business, just never took the time to spend a day shopping at MBS. And, woohoo! I loved it. Im not a huge shopper, especially not these huge malls which usually are very crowded. Yikes. This, however, was a breath of fresh air. Even on the saturday before Mother's day, it was buzzing but not crowded, it was busy but not cramping-your-style. The shops are great, the avenues wide, the directory helpful, the food plazas serve great foods (hakar style but with aircon!), and the watch avenue is absolutely yummy for watch lovers. Finishing off the day with oysters and chablis in one of the restaurants, and you have 11 hours in a shopping mall...there's a first! Just remember, it is singapore, so it is (relatively) expensive..."
,,The place for brands,5.0,,If you're looking for high end brands this is the place to be. They have some great places to eat including Gordan Ramsay. Just make sure you don't get tempted to go to the casino instead. This is a must visit place.
,,"Singapore's largest mall, and the only one open late",4.0,,"This is a huge mall—almost 1 million sq ft and with over 300 stores and restaurants. Many of the top luxury brands locate their flagship outlets here, so you have the biggest and most glamorous boutiques. One such example is the stunning Louis Vuitton atelier which is located in its own ""island"" in the middle of the Bay and accessible by a walkway that runs underwater. The nautical theme fits perfectly and there is a balcony where you can see stunning views of the Singapore skyline.
The upscale stores are located on the upper levels and the stores in the two basements are more budget—including a drugstore, a small supermarket, fast-food outlets and two food courts.
There are a wide variety of restaurants scattered throughout the mall, ranging from those by top names such as Wolfgang Puck, Daniel Boulud and Gordon Ramsey to midrange and budget eateries such as Toast Box, Coffee Bean & Tealeaf and Fatt Choy Express.
One of the Mall's biggest drawbacks is its lack of signage and information. They have electronic guide stations but they are hard to use and often out of order. Even if you know its unit number, finding a store is often a huge challenge because most of the stores don't display any numbers and the corridors are long and can be very confusing.
It can be even harder to find some of the celebrity restaurants located on the upper floors, as these are accessible only through an elevator that seems to be designed to be hidden. You need to access the elevator through glass doors that lead to the casino, but if you did not know this, you would never find it unless you're planning to enter the casino.
It's baffling why the architects would make it so difficult to navigate but the mall's management must share the blame as the lack of signage and clear directions should be something that is easily corrected.
With a casino, theater, sky park and museum in addition to the shops, the number of visitors is almost always more than the parking facilities so finding a parking spot can be a huge issue. Many theater goers end up late because they underestimate the time it takes to get a spot."
,,Top quality shopping,3.0,,For a relaxing wander to see how the other half live and shop. See some of the world's most exclusive jewellers and clothing outlets. Lunch at the end of the canal watching the little boats circle under the oculus is something we will always remember. Wait till the water valves are turned on and wait 10 minutes to watch the gradual building effect. Quite spectacular.
,,Lovely to look but you need $$$,4.0,,Really nice and airy place with plenty of shops to look at. Food areas are nice and toilets are superb. All high end shops but air conditioning is appreciated. Make sure you go to roof for excellent views over river.
,,Waterfall surprise.,5.0,,"This is just not about the highend shops in the Marina Bay Sands complex.

Had lunch today with my local friend at Beanstro, we sat outside around the Gondola turning bay.

We were enjoying the meal when the most extraordinary thing happened...a waterfall came down from the clear concave roof, taking us both by surprise.

It was amazing...even with all the water there was no splashing around the turning circle and tables. the passing Gondolas appeared to be dry as well.

It lasted maybe ten minutes...people gathered around watching....taking pictures and enjoying themselves.

I'm not sure how often it happens everyday, perhaps hourly - if you are at Marina Bay Shoppes definitely do not miss this."
,,High end shopping,4.0,,"Nice mall to look round, although shops are up market, nice outlook over harbour, there is a casino here if you like a flutter, can be quite peaceful away from crowds."
,,A must see in Singapore.,5.0,,"Our travel agent said we must not miss going to Marina Bay, and she was right.

If you want to visit the casino you must take your passport, which we had left in the hotel safe, so we couldn't go in. Probably saved us some money!!

There is a canal running through the largest collection of high end shops I've seen in a long time. We sat and had coffee watching the gondolas conveying people along the canal, very reminiscent of the Venetian in Vegas.

One shop not to miss is the Louis Vuitton store which is the most beautiful I've ever seen.

Do visit Marina Bay when you are in Singapore, it's an experience not to be missed."
,,All of the luxury stores in one place,4.0,,"The shoppes can be accessed by train (MRT) to Bayfront station or via taxi. In addition to hundreds of luxury stores there are a number of restaurants, a casino, and some smaller eateries. There is also the MasterCard theatre which often has a Broadway type musical or stage production on. Would recommend a visit even if it is just for some window shopping"
,,High end shopping mall - with Venetian style canal - of course!,4.0,,"I was strolling around the bay area of Singapore one Saturday back in April and I decided to head towards the Marina Bay Gardens. On my way, using the SMRT transport system I found myself lured to the big and exclusive shopping mall they call The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands.

I had no intention of doing any big name, brand shopping but I did like wandering around and capturing some of the atmosphere in suitably cool, air conditioned surroundings. I liked the way that many oriental shoppers seemed to want to have their photographs taken by the signs of the big brand, exclusive shops. Gazing down on the Venetian style canal a floors below was a nice way to wile away a few minutes. And towards the end of the afternoon you could watch a water display on a concave roof as it drained down a large plug hole and created a waterfall below. Somehow quite mesmorizing..."
,,You get what you pay for!,5.0,,"The whole Marina Bay complex has everything to satisfy the whims of the affluent. The hotel itself offers outstanding views from the top floor bars and restaurant, either out to an unbelievably crowded sea or inland to a bustling business district. At its feet is a shopping mall with every designer label you can think of, jewellers of the likes of Tiffanys and Patek Phillipe et al. There are several themed restaurants which are pretty good value (try the pizza one which is outstanding) and a 'hawker centre' where very reasonable local dishes are prepared on the spot. Everything about this complex screams 'expensive' but you do get what you pay for. Definitely worth a visit if you're in town."
,,Shopping haven and great food.,4.0,,We mainly visited Marina bay to shop and eat some amazing food at the food court. Local delicacies and continental....super yumm. on the ground floor we stopped at the ultimate drive and booked ourselves to drive the Ferrari. An experience of a life time. you can spend your entire day here. We stepped out to go see the gallery and the art exhibition. very nice.
,,Are you rich?,3.0,,I came here to visit the casino with my partner. I can't afford to shop here. If you can afford to buy/want to buy designer goods this is the place for you. Being here just made me feel super poor. The building itself is nice though.
,,Great food court,4.0,,Basement level food court was amazing but expensive Defiantly worth a look around And all the designer shops Not a place for budget travellers But a nice place too look around Go up to 4th floor and do the skywalk
,,Singapore in 1 day,5.0,,"Before shopping or buying a MRT/ticket you will need local currency the Singapore $. In 2016 around $2 per £1. When changing stirling, often the highest exchange rate is in the country you are visiting.
At the exchange only take $10 bills as the highest denomination as it is easy to pay in $10 multiples, rather than pass over a $50 bill and then have to count quickly, whether you have the correct change. In a hurry it can be an unnecessary stress.
With One whole day to spend in Singapore, there are three Must Do’s.
1. Have an early start and go to theBotanical Gardens - Pick up the MRT Circle Line to Botanical Gardens. This Garden is a UNESCO World Heritage Park. Not to be missed. The paths are well sign posted, leading to 3 lakes with fish and terrapins. The park has many specimen Heritage trees. If you like Orchids, you will have a treat. If you are not sure about Orchids you will be blown over by the varieties. This garden has 1000 species and 2000 hybrids. Also visit 6 different themed gardens, Healing-Fragrance-Foliage-Evolution-Ginger-and Childrens gardens. There is no charge to enter the Botanical Garden. Open from 8am to 6pm.
The Orchid Garden is free to children-50p ($1) for pensioners and £2.50 ($5) for visitors below 60 years old
2. Raffles Bar – After lunch and your visit to the Botanical Gardens, experience a Gin Sling at the Raffles hotel.

3. Marina Bay Gardens – Having relaxed in the bar, take the MRT to Marina Bay Gardens. There is plenty to see and two enormous glass domes filled with tropical trees and plants. In the evening the gardens are floodlit.
To add to your experience and very close, view the Marina Sands Hotel that is like a yacht suspended in the sky. From exiting the gardens, the hotel can be visited via an escalator. Once in the hotel you can make your way down to the basement that has an air conditioned Luxury shopping mall, with many places to eat. It also has a Gondola to sail on.
A refreshing way to end the long day."
,,Must See,4.0,,This is a place you must see. Amazing architecture and visually appealing. We ate in the food court where there was plenty of cheap options. Also relaxed in the cafe of the hotel foyer. A lot of high end shops but worth the look.
,,"Shopping, restaurants, casino & architecture",4.0,,"Very upscale mall, casino. Plenty of restaurants and nice walk along the bay. If want to go into casino have your passport. Worth going to top of the towers"
,,Huge Multi Level Shopping Arcade,5.0,,"Easy to get to the complex.
Best to get the MRT to Bayfront station and walk.
Yes, It is easy to walk over the Helix bridge from the Singapore Flyer area.
A huge range of upmarket stores and a foodcourt to suit all budgets.
Many historic photos of Singapore on display.
Great air conditioned location to visit day or night in any weather.
Wear comfortable footwear and take your camera."
,,world class quality,4.0,,"One of the largest luxury shopping malls in Singapore. You can shop, eat, play ice skating, enjoy the Sampan rides (which is inspired with the Venetian, in Las Vegas) and a lot more. The place is very accessible, just alight at Bayfront Station."
,,Best place for window shopping,4.0,,Visited here after visiting the Marina Bay Sky Park. Almost all of them are expensive brands and hence out of reach of many ordinary travellers. But then its a good place to window shop and see the best brands in the world.
,,Must See Shopping Centre,5.0,,"This shopping centre is definitely targeting wealthy clientele and you can basically see every famous label there is in the world. Everything except the food court is expensive. However, there is an internal canal so, a ride on the Gondola is a must, just for the experience. Absolutely over the top but a must visit venue."
,,"Awesome shopping center for the wealthy, beautiful place to visit and cool off for the rest of us mortals",4.0,,"The shoppes is a massive shopping center where you can find nearly every single designer under one roof. Needless to say if you are a mortal (like I am) you may decide to treat yourself with one shop or just enjoy some window shopping time and admiring the beauty of the place. The architecture is noteworthy, it even has a little canal with boats inside the building!
It is connected to the Casino and from there you can go visit the artscience museum and come out to watch the light and music show that plays every night in the waters of the marina.
At the time I was there, the ""pasarbella"" was just outside. It was a place with tables, street food, drinks and music. It seemed to be quite popular. It was a lovely place to sit by the bay and relax at the end of the day."
,,Great place to escape the heat,4.0,,"The shops here are generally pretty expensive and targeted squarely at a wealthy clientele, but it's never too crowded and is well air-conditioned, so makes for a perfect escape on a hot day in Singapore."
,,"Excellent Shopping Mall visited on October 30, 2015",4.0,,"The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, which is excellent Shopping Mall. We visited on October 30, 2015, they have most exclusive collection."
,,Huge and expensive,5.0,,"The mall is huge and most of the stores are the luxury brands. The mall is connected to Marina Bay Casino. There's a small ""tunnel"" inside the mall. You may take a short boat ride similar to the boat ride in the Venetian Hotel."
,,Shopping centre for the wealthy,4.0,,"My wife and I stayed at Marina Bay Sands Hotel for 3 nights, so we walked in this place to have a look. It is filled with expensive designer label stores. Indicative of how many wealthy people there are in this world that we live in."
,,Exclusive shopping mall - fantastic location,4.0,,"The 'shoppes' at Marina Bay Sands are probably the most exclusive collection of stores you will find under one roof. Every high-end name you can imagine is here, therefore it is an exclusive mall.
It's architecture and location is impressive and the stroll along the marina/ bay front is really pleasant with fantastic views across the Singapore skyline."
,,High end shops,4.0,,"I normally would even bother going to these type of shopping malls but it's got a casino there,linked to the mrt,outside has a nice view,a decent food court and dc cafe is there for something different and a high end tea and biscuits shop just for something different. No free wifi for non guests though"
,,High end mall worth visiting to see.,4.0,,It's a high end mall with all top brands and a very interesting place to buy branded stuff or take a stroll doing window shopping. There is a canal in the mall and it is adjacent to the casino.
,,"Beautiful Mall, Terrific Variety of Shoppes",5.0,,"Definitely worth a visit if you are in Singapore!

Much nicer than practically all other malls in the country - spacious, beautifully designed and has a wide assortment of shops from mid to high end.

Offers terrific views of Marina Bay Sands and the Singapore Flyer to boot (work your way to the highest level and step outside and snap away with your camera!"
,,Make it to the top,5.0,,One of the most amazing malls/hotels I have seen in the world. What other mall has a gondola and ice rink in it? I did spend $115 USD for lunch (and I just had a burger and fries...the GF had a bit more). Make it to the top to get the most amazing view of Singapore.
,,Luxury Shopping Mall with a Canal Inside,5.0,,"The mall is huge and very modern, with great architecture. It offers only world-famous fashion brands and might be a little bit too expensive for some.

But there is this man-made canal in the middle of the mall, where visitors can take boat rides throughout the lengths of the mall. Very bright and sparkling view!"
,,Cool off,4.0,,"This is a nice place to cool off on a hot day walking around town. The spacious air-conditioned mall provides lots of things to see and shop. We did not purchase anything but it was still good checking out all the huge name-brand stores. You could spend many hours in there. There is a huge food court there with all kinds of wonderful food. Just a walk up from the MRT station, easy to get to."
,,Impressive,4.0,,Linked to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and wonderfully air conditioned. A very high end mall but also with some high street shops. There is even a canal on which you can take a gondola ride!!.
,,So much luxury it's almost ridiculous,4.0,,"Can you believe that there is a 'river' that you can gondola down in the middle of this shopping centre? Then you need to see to believe. High end shops, amazing restuarants - be sure to take your credit card with!"
,,Perfect shopping centre. If you have money,5.0,,"I mean, if you are interested in fashion and/or willing to spend some money... This is the place.

,,Luxury mall,5.0,,"what you may see here all luxury brand, exclusive restaurant. But don't worry there's a foodcourt if you re starving, at least you may find something to eat not costing alot."
,,Exhilarating,5.0,,"Came around to this luxurious shopping on Bayfront Ave located beside Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Was very impressed by the clean layout and very spacious walkway. Majority are all high end quality goods but even if you cannot afford to purchase, it's still an eye opener. Overall ratings I give 5 star out of 5."
,,A nice experience,4.0,,We had a nice 3 hours at the shoppingcenter. Many nice shops and restaurant possibilities. It looks a little more expensive than average.
,,Take your credit card,3.0,,"The Shoppes at Marina Bay are wonderful for window shopping. The shop keepers could do with a smile on their face which would welcome you in. All the high end brands and Zara there also. Plenty of places to eat, however I recommend you blood for any of the celebrity chef restaurants. Good way to pass a couple of hours in the cool."
,,High-end Shopping Center!,4.0,,Shop for luxury brands in Marina Bay. It's a nice place to shop or roam around while waiting for the weather to be a bit cooler before going to the Botanical Gardens.
,,Breathtaking!,5.0,,This is one of the biggest shopping malls I have ever seen. Huge and posh stores for every wallet! They even have canals where you can take a boat ride :)

,,Nicely done up place,5.0,,Excellent place to shop your heart out and plenty of eatery options to keep your energy levels up. Any time you feel exhausted just get out in the open to catch a fresh breath.
,,Marina Bay & Gardens by the Bay enclave,5.0,,"When you're in Singapore, to me, this is the best place to hang around with your friends and family in the whole enclave of the boulevard. As for Marina Bay Sands Towers, I was blown away by its enormity of shops and surroundings not to mention the Food court. If you crave for high end designer labels, this is the place for you! We just enjoyed the whole sight-seeing thing and after three hours of walking ,riding elevators & escalators, you're bound to get famished and the Food Court has everything on offer. What can I say we enjoyed MBS very much. I'm sure you will too. By the way, I did not stay at the hotel as we were book elsewhere. Will visit MBS again! Thanks."
,,"Nice walk around, high end boutiques",4.0,,"While staying at marina bay sands we had a wander around the shopping area, all the top brands you can think of & pricey too so keep your wives & girlfriends away!"
,,Fine dining on the 57th floor,5.0,,From the top floor the views are spectacular especially at night. You can go outside the restaurant and have cocktails whilst enjoying the views. The food in the restaurant is amazing... Best I have had in Singapore for fine dining (not local food which I love anyway).
,,Great place for shopping,5.0,,"Lots of branded fashion, Michelin Star Restaurants, etc. Great for a day out and shop and hang out ."
,,Definitely worth the money u have to pay to check out the view from top !,5.0,,"would suggest it to all! the view from the top is magnificent ! you can see the flyer,race track ,gardens by the bay and all !"
,,nice spot to shopping,5.0,,"high class shopping center. all brand already here. amazing mall in singapore, i think is the best mall in singapore."
,,Upscale and Highend Boutiques,5.0,,"If you are looking to splurge or do a bit of fancy window shopping ending with a trip to the yummy, vinrant and versatile food court, then you must come here.

My family and I go to Singapore often and it is never a complete trip without coming to Mariba Bay Sands.

Sometimes it is to splurge on a shoe or on a dress or a purse followed by some dim sum by the ice skating arena and then some tea and macaroons. Other times it is to window shop and to buy tickets to a play or a musical at the Marina Bay Sands Theatre and, a few times it is to the casino followed by some open air garden time.

This is a wonderful space to spend the day if you are bored of the city centre, want the same types of stores, food and fun, but in a different venue.

This is also a happening place to visit on New Year's Eve. However make sure you go early and if you have plans to eat dinner, make sure to book seats at the restaurant, WAY in advance, so you dont have to stand in line and wait for seats for an hour. And also, catch the fire works at night, if you or your children are into that kind of loud entertainment."
,,a nice short walk,5.0,,"i love this place even just seeing around , take a walk and coffee time at beanstro was a kind of my favo place to hangout before go to the airport"
,,Functional shopping,3.0,,Closeby the sands hotel.. Good for dining for the people staying in the sands hotel. There are some budget dining options as well as luxury restaurants.
,,Quality shopping with dining,4.0,,"Nice shopping complex with lots of shops selling designer gear, air conditioned. There is also a food court here plus a Bistro & Wolfgang Pucks restaurant 'Cut'. There is also a good size 'ice' skating rink."
,,Enormous and insanely expensive,3.0,,"This shopping mall is enormous and full of stuff a normal person cannot afford. If you like extremely overpriced branded goods, this is your mall. Also, there is a small boat service in the main corridor."
,,An entertaining stroll away from the heat,5.0,,"The Shoppes at Marina Bay is not only a high end shopping paradise combined with a casino, but also a kaleidoscope of different things to do. If you are hungry, the option takes you from famous celebrity chefs their flagship restaurants, guaranteed to please the most demanding, all the way across the culinary world including a great food court where you will find the best from the Singaporean hawker food. All this in a stunning modern and almost open air setting with its big glass enclosure allowing the sun to come in but not the heat. In addition to a plethora of shops and boutiques as well as restaurants, there is an impressive fountain that will offer a unique spectacle to view when in operation. The fountain is a big translucent plexiglass bowl set on top of the central part of the mall that is best viewed from below as it fills with water and then drains it in a waterfall to a lagoon setting bellow. You don't have to be a shopaholic to enjoy this place and when it rains it is even better. The Bayfront MRT station is right there at the Marina Bay Sands complex, so you can get there from virtually any corner of Singapore without getting wet or breaking a sweat. Go for a stroll and then go to TWG tea house for afternoon tea (you will be spoiled for choices when it comes to tea - over 900 different ones)"
,,Marina bay.,5.0,,"Lots to see here.large shopping centre,even if you cannot afford the luxury goods on sale just great to wander around.On the promenade have a look at the science museum,from the outside it looks like a hand or more romantically a lotus.We did not have time to go inside,but what a wonderful building if you can call it that.When we visited it was the 6th day of the Chinese New Year celebrations so we were lucky enough to see and hear the Lion and drummers visiting some of the stores.At night we saw the laser water and music show,and after took a bum boat to Clarke quay. Where it was all happening music footy on tv, drinks lots of noise and enjoyment.
On the ground floor of the shopping centre lots of food on offer,Chinese Thai ,Korean,at really reasonable prices.You can also be a bit quieter and go and sit and have a cupcake and coffee.Also very clean restrooms.Important."
,,Good place to stop and relax,4.0,,Big luxury mall at Marina Bay Sands. Has a really nice terrace with chairs overlooking the Bay. Inside you can find all the top brands and fine dining restaurants. On the lowest level there’s is a little canal where you can go around with a boat. It has a nice ambience and fits perfectly with the luxury hotel.
,,Fabulous high end mall,4.0,,"You can buy a Ferrari here if you can spare the cash. Superbly designed mall worth the visit for coffee of food, and soak up the atmosphere. So far as shopping goes, if you have to ask the price, you cant afford it - ask anyway....it's fun!"
,,Sky Kite Flying n Window Shopping,4.0,,"Tourist hotspot.

Make sure you get ready your visa or mastercard for an ultimate shopping experience. Filled with luxurious and branded boutique shops. Heaven for shopaholic! This three-storey luxury mall for high-end retail brands like Bally, Chanel, Fendi, Gucci, Miu Miu, Yves Saint Laurent, Hermès etc.

Everything here including the food court and other franchises are at 20% marked up prices possibly due to the high rent.

There are high-end restaurants and well-known restaurant chains located all around the mall.
The Rasapura Masters food court imported all of the local best. So many different types of good food all in one area. The price is expensive thou..To find more affordable places to eat there, I suggest Toast Box, The Gong Cha or Din Tai Fung. It may be a little too packed at meal hours. Expect the long queue or get your set earlier if you have kids or elderly with you to prevent them from waiting too long...

One of Singapore’s two casinos is located there too. I can't afford this luxury; and to minimize the damage to my pockets, I prefer window shopping whenever I make a trip down to the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands.

There re are areas just outside the mall to sit and chill. It is a nice spot especially at night; watching my nephew flying his kite and enjoying the view is not too bad too.

Evenings at Marina Bay Sands are also exciting with performances by the Singapore River."
,,A must see for any shopper worth their weight in gold,5.0,,"Even before the internal waterfall starts, you cannot help but wonder does this place actually end. it is immaculate, stunningly beautiful, and done with class and elegance, for a shopping mall. the casino, gardens and museum are all in the complex and the hotel itself is also something else.
so when you win the lottery, forget about your local best shopping experience, jump on a plane get in there and do some serious damage to your credit limits. or just have lunch and watch the other half go about their daily business."
,,Don't miss experiencing this unique Luxurious mall......,5.0,,"This has got to be the ""One of a Kind"" very unique shopping mall here, maybe in the region too.

This mall is so huge, super spacious, super luxurious, very beautiful, shops are of extremely expensive high end renowned brands. It is not just a shopping mall, but rather a part of an overall total experience within an Integrated Resort.

Which also comprises a Casino, Hotel & an Art museum. It is also linked to nearby Gardens by the Bay.

Definitely shopping here is not an option unless one has very deep pockets. But come here for the experience. It's worth it."
,,How to rate it???,3.0,,"Marina Bay Sands is the most luxurious hotel and area in Singapore. Therefore, you should assume the same for its shopping mall.
It's right across the street from the hotel....huge, shiny and expensive. It is immaculately clean, well organized and you almost couldn't find ordinary brands, just the high end.
On the basement floor is a very good food court with many eateries at normal prices."
,,High End shopping,4.0,,"This Mall is a great place to window shop - all the 'big' names are here, and there are lots of interesting architectural flourishes (such as the waterfall fountain, and the 'Venetian' canal!)"
,,Fancy.....but amazing!!!,5.0,,"Expensive, more expensive and much more expensive shops you will find there!

Only brands, only luxury and the best shops in Marina Bay Shopping Mall.

What about some lunch for 250$, face cream for 400$, bags for 5 000$, shoes for 10 000$, watch for 15 000$ and......tea for 17 500$ per kg?!? If you are a fan of luxury life, expensive and special staff around you - your stop should be there. Casino and restaurants, beauty salons and boat trips - everything is there.

All the people visit this shopping mall, but not everyone can spend so much money for shopping.
Just imagine this fancy and luxury shopping!"
,,Another supersize mall with expensive shops,4.0,,"This shopping centre is another supersize mall with lots of expensive brands. Good for window shopping and it does take a while to get around it. It has a skating rink near food court (kinda like Dubai mall) and the food court was slightly more pricey compared to other mall food court in Singapore.

Good place to escape from heat :)"
,,Very Fancy Shopping Centre,5.0,,It's a very much over the top Shopping centre with luxury brands and many attractions. It's worth to visit even if you don't plan to buy anything.
,,Very Impressive,5.0,,"Not just a hotel, but a high end mall with an ice skating rink and a gondola on the bottom floor. Not for anyone who is looking to save money, but a must see when in Singapore."
,,Nice shopping mall,4.0,,"Everything there was expensive except for the food court. We went window shopping for hours and ate lunch at the end. They offered all kinds of cuisine from Korean to European and American. There is even a Casino inside the mall reserved exclusively for foreigners. The mall is also a good place to view the daily laser light show at 8PM and 9:30 PM. From here one can see the water jets and the projected pictures on the water jets. To view the Laser show better, it is preferable to stand next to the Merlion on the other side of the bay near the Raffles MRT stop"
,,A must see fabulous place,5.0,,It is very beautiful place. It has all the brand stores that I could not afford to buy anything. Ice rink was great and so was the food courts. It also has the theaters. Great place to spend evening and have dinner.
,,Overpriced designer shops - avoid the food court in the basement,3.0,,"This isn't really a shopping centre unless you are into overpriced branded shopping in which case I imagine it's heaven on earth! I bought a meal in the food court downstairs which tasted nice but was lukewarm - not sure how they managed to serve cold food because the place was packed. There were no tables available anywhere to sit down, so many people, and not enough seating space. Afterwards I bought a take away coffee and sat on one of the very comfortable chairs which run down the middle of the shopping centre and people watched, which was the highlight of my visit. Great to go and see the water, light and sound show held each night outside the shops though. There is also a small skating rink in the basement."
,,Singapore Itself!,5.0,,No visit to Singapore is complete is complete without a visit here. It's nice during the day - but especially charming at night. I recommend paying the (slightly expensive) $22 for admittance to Marina Bay Sand's observation deck in order to watch the sunset and following night-lights over Marina Bay. A trip highlight for me!
,,Very pleasant,4.0,,"Perfectly clean loads of food perfect especially if your at the hotel the only criticism is that most of the shops are prestige, extremely expensive and empty as a result. But the other half are great."
,,Good walk,3.0,,"Here for the day, but we did spend a few hours walking around the mall here. Very good access from the marina bay sands. It is a very nice mall, with about 3 or 4 levels down. Lots of restaurants too. It did seem to be most clothes and watches. But it's a great walk just off the hotel if you wanting for a quick one."
,,Nice place to hang out,5.0,,"we accidentally walked on Marina Bay Sands. This wasn't on our plan yet we don't care, we're on our vacation. Mall was big enough for you to be tired at the end of the day. High end shops especially at the 2nd floor that some names we never even heard of. Still, beautiful place to hang out and there's a canoe in the middle that you can ride if you're into that romantic blah blah."
,,Really you enjoy,5.0,,I strongly recommended this palace for couple and really enjoy life with relax visit shopp and cruise dine inn
,,Beautiful mall,5.0,,Beautiful mall better suited for window shopping than actual shopping. There is a canal inside where you can go for a boat ride as well as walk outside and check out the bay
,,High end shopping,4.0,,"It is a mall that is beautifully planned with a Venice-like stream running through certain parts of it. It is a high end shopping mall. I was there as I had to walk pass that place to go to Garden by the Bay. Not everyone who works there could point you to the right direction as I discovered. Only those who are at the Information counter would know that place well enough to help you if you need any help. BTW, the girl who was on duty that afternoon, did a marvelous job by showing me a short-cut to Gardens by the bay."
,,Extravagant & expensive,4.0,,"A good place to wander around if you have a late flight or you love shopping but make sure you have plenty of money!! It so reminded me and my husband of shopping and hotels in Dubai, over the top, good to see but not to our liking."
,,Nice to wander around but expensive,3.0,,I spent a couple of hours wandering around the shops at Marina Bay Sands. It was nice to have a look and the architecture is beautiful but I don't think it is the best place to go shopping in Singapore being very high end and not having a lot of range.
,,A lovely mall with surprisingly cheap food.,5.0,,"We visited the mall after walking round the gardens and were stunned to see so many luxury brands. The whole area is stunning and well decorated plus well signposted for us tourists.

We visited the food mall downstairs which was very busy and surrounded the ice rink. There was loads of choice and it wasn't expensive. We went for rice dishes and it tasted great."
,,Huge selection of luxury brands!,4.0,,"This mall boasts a variety of luxury brands such as Prada, Gucci and Chanel. It also has some more affordable brands like Charles and Keith."
,,A must visit place,4.0,,"So many things to do and see around this area, it is a must visit place. You can easily spend a few hours at the Marina Bay Sands Shopping Mall, Art Science Museum, and Merlion Park, enjoying all the new impressive architecture and shopping. The day that we visited, the 8th Asian Para Games were held there. We watched the sailing and cycling competition, full of excitement. The lady at the information counter at the Marina Bay Sands Shopping Mall was very nice and helpful. She even connected my phone to Wi-Fi so I can send mail to my family. Thank you.Singapore always gives me a good impression.
Happy Travelling!"
,,Beautiful mall,3.0,,"This mall has such a beautiful architecture, it has all the shops you may know. So many designer shops. It's worth a visit. Eating here was a bit tricky for us, we couldn't find anywhere to our liking and most of the continental restaurants required booking or there was a big queue. Everything else was Asian food that didn't interest us."
,,Window shopping at its best,4.0,,"The word opulence comes to mind trying to describe the shopping area of Marina Bay Sands. There is this feeling of spaciousness and luxury; style and finish and that's just the building. Then you add the classy finishes to the shop fronts, that most top fashion houses are here, the gondola rides and this place really has a wow factor. There are also shops where you may actually be able to buy something. It was worth the visit just to window shop. We went in the evening."
,,"beautiful mall, shops you've see before, and a food court that is hit and miss",3.0,,"The mall is beautiful - the shops world class - clones of the rest of the world. There's a Gondola ride - really - in one of the wings - and people were riding. The food court is large, many types of food - however in the two times I ate there in 3 days - the food was not freshly cooked, cold, with basic rude service. Much better options in Singapore"
,,Very Impressive,4.0,,"The place was totally so nice, it is located along the Marina Bay Sands premises, next to the Hotel, The Shoppes was more than like Rodeo Drive"
,,"Rodeo Drive of Asia, and much more!",5.0,,"Cool, the place was really cool, it was so tight clean, that you would not want to touch anything, and it was fully air-conditoned, Singapore is really hot, i mean really hot outside, so come on it"
,,Regular mall with gandola riding,4.0,,"This place as smiliar as other mall in the world. However the little canal where people can ride small boad is interesting. Also the big fountain at the center of atrium Is very nice. If you are looking for little feeling of being riding a venitian gandola in singapore, this is the place."
,,Extravaganza,5.0,,"The glittering shops, expensive quality products, brand names, designer's boutiques...everything is there. It is a pleasure even to walk and window shopping if one can not afford to buy anything. The whole atmosphere is grand.. Lovely canal inside the shopping mall where one can have boat rides. Great huge waterfalls. In some of the shopping arcades, there were benches to sit on a relax but not everywhere. Lots of food places. Good food court. It is a place to spend some quality time."
,,Shoppers paradise,5.0,,"If you are into high end brands, this is the place to shop. The shops are excellent to just walk through the centre and look at the excellent window displays, if you are not into spending. There is a huge variety in restaurants and cafes. The shops open late in the morning and stay open into the late evening. The whole area is elegant and comfortable."
,,Amazing lazar light show after dark,5.0,,Amazing place see the Lazar light show after dark and the pool up on the top floor of the Marina Sands Hotel. Wow you have to stay there to swim in the pool but still it is sensational.
,,Elegant home of quality,4.0,,"The mall is probably projected as a place to find your favorite brand, enjoy professionality of shopkeepers and eventually have some fun. This is really working fine. Just I was bit disappointed that despite of presence of luxury brands, mall does not offer any place just to sit down and bit relax on the way from one shop to another. U can just stop in café where u have don't have the freedom to come and leave whenever you want."
,,Amazing indoor mall!,5.0,,"The designer shops are surrounded by an underground Venice-type canal complete with gondolas, much like Las Vegas."
,,Luxurious shopping,4.0,,"A great place for exclusive shooping and also for having lunch or dinner.

Take a break to try some food at foodcourt, where you can find a great variety of world food (by the way, I couldn't find anything vegan, even in the indian restaurant!).

Another choice is to visit any of the restaurants upstairs where you will also have a great view to the marina walkside."
,,Bring your money,5.0,,"This is an amazing Shopping Centre. I'd say the best one in Singapore. If you can only get to 1 Mall, make it this one, but leave at least half a day. It's big."
,,High End Mall,5.0,,"Beautiful mall with all of the best shops but very very very expensive. Modern and well laid out with a ""channel"" in the middle. Good food. Food court is good. Crowded and busy but worth the visit. Easy access via taxi. So well organized."
,,Most luxurious mall in the city,5.0,,"Best shopping destination if you were a brandy person. Singapore is a beautiful city, but at certain times it could feel too hot and humid. This mall was my favorite ""escaping the heat spot"". It's so large and got practically everything. A lot of nice resturant and Caffè too. They got a casino also. The mall is connected to the famous Marina Bay Sands Hotel, where you can buy a ticket to go to the SkyPark Observation Deck and have a panoramic view of Singapore."
,,Designer Haven,5.0,,"The Shoppes in Singapore is a shopping haven for designer brands if you are looking for branded stores. You name it, the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands has it. From Louis Vuitton to Hermes to Dior, Berlutti, Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci and the list goes on and on. The Louis Vuitton store here is probably the largest in South East Asia.

However, the Shoppes is not only about labels but they also have mid level brands like Zara, Massimo Dutti etc. to cater for the mid level shoppers. It also has 1 floor for electronic stuff like phones and cameras. There is also a Hamley's toy store here.

Other attractions at the Shoppes is a cinema and a gondola ride ala Singapore. The gondola ride is just a 100 metre canal ride in the Shoppes which costs S$10 per person, children aged 2 inclusive. We took a ride and found it pricey as the ride itself was short and no big deal.

The Shoppes is also known for its 6 renowned restaurants owned by internationally famous chefs; notably Wolfgang Puck and Gordon Ramsay. Among the 6, there is an Italian restaurant, a Japanese restaurant and a Chinese restaurant.

The only thing that the Shoppes does not have is a department store like Isetan or Robinsons. However, it's still a great place to shop and you won't be disappointed."
,,Luxury in Singapore !,5.0,,This is the place to shop in Singapore. You will find most of the best and luxury brands within the comfort of a Shopping Center. It is definitely a much better choice than shopping at Orchard Road. I definitely recommend.
,,Exclusivity for the high-end shopper,4.0,,"This mall is made up of rows and rows of upmarket designer brand stores such as Gucci, Prada, Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs, Jimmy Choo and many many more. Maybe worth a walk through the centre to view the shop fronts and high end clothing on display, if one is not intending to buy. Many restaurants and up market coffee shops are beautifully laid out in the center aisles. A canal water feature adds to the attraction of the centre. In another aisle is a water feature donned with gift boxes."
,,Not the Place if You Want New Fashions,3.0,,"Singapore continues to get rave reviews about their economy. Based on that we expected shopping to be top of the line. Instead we found the shops at the Marina Bay Sands as well as those along Orchard Road to be 6-12 months behind Hong Kong, Taiwan, US and Europe. Sales staff were more excited about our latest Nike shoes than what they were selling.
Lots of mainland Chinese shopping and buying without a second thought, but would not recommend for anyone with the opportunity to buy in another country. Except for sale items, price were no bargain either, especially in light of being several seasons behind many other countries."
,,Tiring!,5.0,,"Hopefully you have a nice comfy pair of shoes to walk around this massive and spacious building to find what you are looking for! So many shops, so many yummy restaurants! Always will be one of my favorite place to go to while in Singapore!"
,,Awesome Shopping,5.0,,From high - end boutiques to every day shopping this place has it all. Great restaurants and awesome food court.
,,"Great location for access to many Singapore tourist locations including river cruises, sky park and Gardens by the Sea.",4.0,,Centrally located for many of the best tourist locations in Singapore this is an essential part of any extended visit. It's a massive mall where too much is never enough. But there is plenty to enjoy for not much more than the cost of lunch.
,,Pretty cool and luxurious mall,4.0,,"If you come to Singapore, also shopping is a reason. The shoppes at marina bay offer all luxurious and common brands that you can imagine. In addition, the architecture is very nice and you have a very good view on the bay."
,,Nice but for very few people,2.0,,If you have a credit card limit of like a million and all your possessions have been burned in a fire this is the perfect place for you. If not then probably skip it. It's just high end stores and nothing for a middle or working class people. Definitely skip the food court as there is not enough seating for even half the people and you will walk around forever to find a place. People stand next to tables that are almost done just to get them making eating here very uncomfortable. The staff is good and fast but too fast for the poor design for the amount of people
,,Shopping and Eating Glaore,5.0,,This mall is HUGE. Class A stores abound catering to mostly western style clothing and personal accessories. Its like New York and Paris in Asia. The restaurant choices are a wide variety. Try the Lakhsa noodle soup -- pretty hot!
,,Iconic Brand Shopping,4.0,,"As you would expect from a luxury hotel the shopping at MBS is all high end as in ""If you have to ask the price of an item than clearly you can not afford to shop there"".
They do have a food court that is more affordable and opens for breakfast."
,,Great shopping till late !,5.0,,This is the only late night shopping place in Singapore with all the luxury brands you can think of! It's a great place to look around after dinner to avoid the crowds and enjoy taking your time to browse.
,,Stunning light show,5.0,,"I would definitely recommend waiting until the evening to visit, the light shows and surrounding skyline lit up is spectacular. The marina bay shopping centre is amazing, the food court is on the bottom floor."
,,Women shop men stop,2.0,,"I am not a shopper hence this really did not turn my crank. The building was impressive but at the end of the day it was full of stuff I did not need, want or was interested in.

The first shopping mall that installs a creche for husbands will make a fortune."
,,Nice shopping,4.0,,A beautiful place to shop though expensive it is quite wonderful there. A nice Christmas photo hotspot
,,Great place to shop for luxury goods,5.0,,If your into luxury goods you need to visit this place. Every brand all in one place and you can get some good deals on your purchases.
,,Not just a shopping mall,4.0,,"This huge shopping mall that connects you to from the MBS Hotel and to the Helix bridge will give you a moment to experience a little version of Gondola from Venice, Italy.
Visitors and customers can ride a boat to explore the place back and forth. Very huge and spacious aside from the high ceiling. A very cool and relaxing time as you explore the whole area, never mind the prices, I was here just to get to Merlion Park anyway."
,,Variety for family,5.0,,"Located in the southern part of Singapore river surrounded by accessible by water taxi. Consisting of retails shops, an ArtScience museum, celebrity chefs' restaurants, world class theatre and luxury labels from around the world. The Shoppes has a little for everyone in the family - don't miss the hourly laser water show!"
,,Amazing,4.0,,"really amazing shops, mainly for the rich with the elegant designers on show. Well worth a loom through if you are here!!"
,,Shoppers paradise,5.0,,Just about every designer label and more in shopping centre - no need to go to Orchard road shops. Excellent choices for food - cheap food court along with high end restaurants covering a variety of cuisines
,,Big brands,4.0,,"Every store in the mall seems high end. Name a big name brand and its there! and multiple levels of it!! Walk to the esplanade or promenade near the water, esp at night for a nice view and the water and light show at 8 and 9:30pm.You can enter from the Marina bay Sands Shoppes and casino area to the Promenade. show is repeated also 11 pm on weekends. don't miss the huge Acrylic well like structure there, its a special one. When one speaks from the opposite side softly, people from the opposite side can clearly hear the words. there is a water way and a small boat ride, if you think its worth it for 10$ per person for a short ride"
,,Nice place,5.0,,This is a high end mall and very huge compound. Don't miss the light show around 9pm daily. Great place to take pictures of Singapore skyscrapers. This moment you can feel Christmas ambience throughout the mall.
,,Great for a walk round and superb Friday night display at 2000,5.0,,"This is a lovely waterfront. Not quite HK or Shanghai, but up there nevertheless because of the compact nature, great shops, lovely views and pleasant places to walk. It really was special watching the Friday night laser show which was very well done and not at all busy.

This place is good in the day and at night. GO!"
,,Don't miss the light show....,5.0,,"This place is huge, there is countless shops, boutique and dining area, at the ground floor there is a restaurant near the water fountain. There is also a boat ride that will bring you around the place. Can enjoy the free light show near observation deck at level 2 at 8.15pm and 9.15pm. at 8.30 can enjoy the water fountain inside the building..from the deck you can have a clear view of high rise buildings, the Singapore flyer and the lake in front. .Parking is expensive at 7 dollar for 1st 3 hours and 1 dollar for subsequent hours..."
,,Upscale shopping,3.0,,"While certainly one of the nicer, fancier malls with a plethora of designer labels, there isn't exactly a shortage of shopping areas in Singapore. There are plenty of other attractions in the vicinity that I'd rather be checking out, such as the waterfront area, Sky Park, or Gardens by the Bay.

On the plus side, there is an MRT station and several quick places to dine at on the bottom level that are convenient for those visiting the Marina Bay area."
,,High end mall,4.0,,"Everything in the mall is from middle to high-end. Only for those who can afford it, or win big from the casino. All the brands are there.

Gonadola is nice, abit costly thou, but a nice ride for those who don't see their pockets.

LV store is worth to experience, walking in from the mall taking the escalator up to the floating LV store. It's huge!

It's very very beautiful to walk outside the MBS shoppes at night, facing the Fullerton walk gives a peaceful beautiful scenery

Alot of the fashion shops are catered majority to men's, guess cause its of the casino, so my wife didn't like it much."
,,good view but outside food not great,3.0,,if you like high en shopping then this the place . the balconies have nice views over teh bay but food on the balconies is pretty average.
,,Good in the day great at night.,4.0,,"Really enjoyed walking round in the day. At the night time they had a fantastic lights display. Lots of opportunity to shop but not my thing, however good selection of shops."
,,Lunch at Shoppes,4.0,,"This centre is very expensive for shopping with only top end things for sale but if you want a meal, keep going down to level B1 and follow the signs. You will find a very inexpensive selection of eateries with a good variety of Asian food to choose from. They are good value for someone looking for a snack after going to the Gardens by the Bay."
,,Huge and something for everyone,4.0,,"This is a huge mall with everything from high street fashion to ultra expensive brands. It's the only mall in Singapore with Tom ford and brioni. Even the LV store has a outdoor balcony where you can take in the amazing skyline. The other attraction to this place are the restaurants. All the celebrity restaurants are here - Gordon Ramsey's bread street kitchen, Wolfgang puck's Cut and Spago. 1 of my favorites"
,,Ritzy,3.0,,"I only ended up here sort of by mistake , it is a very high end and very ritzy shopping centre , I felt like I couldn't afford anything here , I know I can't afford any of these brands , and then I found the food court which was better than most and surprisingly well priced"
,,Nice but too large an area,3.0,,"Worth a visit, even if one can't afford the items Nice way to enjoy a hot afternoon and say that you have ""been there and done that"""
,,Bright highend retail outlets...prices are not for the feint hearted.,5.0,,"This centre caters for highend retail outlets like Tiffany, Gucci, Chanel and many others.

There is a food hall, moderately priced with cuisines to suit all tastes.

The canal has rides available in Venetian style Gondolas steered by Gondoliers, very popular with children.

Christmas decorations for this festive season are bright and colourful.

Take a look when in Singapore, easily accessible MRT on two lines."
,,Head for the bar for a view and a drink,5.0,,"You can do a lot but do head to the bar where you can get the view with a drink. Infinity pools, casinos, discounted bakery in the evening, romantic dinners or all the shopping you want... your pick."
,,Designer,5.0,,This is not a cheap mall. Everything including the food is high-end. Lo of designer brands and the superhero cafe is the best. When you enter ask the desk for any info and the free wi-fi access.
,,Designer Shopping,3.0,,I went to the Marina Bay Sands Shoppes today and unless you're really into your designers I would give it a miss. It's a very large space but focussed on designers and designer restaurants. An experience but not to be repeated too soon.
,,Probably one of the best,5.0,,"As a traveler, shopping is always on the list of things to do when abroad and this shopping center is up there as one of the best visited to date. Yes it is mainly high end brands, however there is plenty to do, be it shopping, visiting the casino, dining in the various restaurants, walking along the river front, going to the cinema, watching a show etc... There are just lists of things to do at this place. But for shopping, would always go back."
,,great security great adventure,5.0,,"It is known to all people already about marina bay sands.
but what i want to highlight is the security.
my friends and I were shopping here and play a lil bit of casino. when we wanted to go home, my friend accidentally left her phone at the toilet and she just realised that after 1 hour.. however, there was a guy who called us because we calling to the phone and they say we can take the phone in the security. very nice of these people. and i would like to thank all of them, i am really sorry i didnt get the name.
Thank you!"
,,Worth a look around,4.0,,"Shops are expensive by comparison, but understandable given the location, brand names and up market restaurants. Handy to transport, casino, and must see light show at 8pm, 9.30pm (and 11pm on Fri/Sat) at the Event Plaza."
,,Fancy mall with a great night water show outside,5.0,,"The mall was too fancy for our budget, yet we enjoyed the walk around it and better off really enjoyed the great watershow right outside. The Louis Vuitton shop sitting on the water was simply gorgeous."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,It can be crowded but it is worth a visit. The shopping mall is amazing especially if you are looking for high end fashion.
,,Brands Shoppers Paradise,4.0,,Located right opposite to the Hotel Marina Bay Sands encapsulates within itself lots-n-lots of high end shops with most leading high-range brand shops. From clothes to jewelry to shoes to classic bags to spoil you! Load your pockets with all your credit cards before you head there ;-)
,,Expensive,3.0,,"It's huge, it's beautiful, it's got all the high end brands, and all the fancy restaurants... but nothing for me. Unless you love paying over the top prices for things you can get cheaper elsewhere, MBS is not the place to go. Everything there is so expensive."
,,very high end,3.0,,"This place looks fantastic, but that's where it ends for me. I'm not rich enough to even window shop there. It's all very high end shops. We were there in the early evening & there was no atmosphere. Most of the shops were empty. I also felt you had to walk very far to get in or out."
,,"Above my budget, free WiFi, cool light show",4.0,,"But it was definitely an enjoyable break from the heat while walking outside. (like when I say above my budget, I mean WAY above - LV, Bvlgari, Porsche, Ferrari, etc.) Plus, free WiFi. There are some more reasonable shops and the food at the food court was delicious and average priced. Easy to get to/from with the MRT. There's a pretty cool light show every night that's free and about 15 minutes, 8:00 and 9:30."
,,Stunning view,4.0,,"If you're a tourist, you can't say that you have visited Singapore unless you have been to this place. The place is huge with so many stores to shop from. Just watch out for the price... a friend of mine from the US was so enticed to buy from Sephora but when she checked for the price of the same item... ummm, she changed her mind and decided to just buy from US. :-P"
,,Great views!,4.0,,There is a range of shops available including very high end as well as a few mid range brands. The shopping centre has great views across the Habour if you go up to the top level. There is a good food court on the ground floor.
,,Shop till you drop,5.0,,"Guess I chose a wrong header for my article. I should say it’s a Millionaire’s Paradise. The shoppes at Marina Bay Sands stores products from all the high end designers and brands. Even Window shopping can prove to be a bit taxing for sure. Lol. It’s a heaven for luxury addict.

Versace, Dolce & Gabbana, Armani, Prada, Fendi, Bottega Veneta, Gucci, Hermès, Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Dior, Christian Louboutin and Saint Laurent everyone is there. Rolex, Piaget, Richard Mille, Franck Muller, Audemars Piguet, Cartier, Bvlgari are like jostling for space. A walk here is like a walk in Alice’s Wonderland. Mesmerizing and fascinating."
,,Scary Huge Expanse of Capitalism Gone Mad,2.0,,We felt we should wander through this enormous shopping centre but rather than being able to dip in and out we seemed to walk miles without a simple exit close to the MRT to return to the hotel and during that walking saw almost no-one buying anything in shops which looked like they only sold top end stuff we wouldn't have wanted. OK the aircon is fierce so welcome after time in the heat of the day of Singapore but other than that we found little to justify the detour.
,,Feel like we were in Venetian Macau,4.0,,"Nice shopping mall with all the high end brands, high end restaurants and coffee shops. On the ground floor have a boat riding just like the one in Venetian Macau."
,,High End,4.0,,Big & glitzy with fancy open areas. If your budget is plenty go for it here... The position is fabulous on the Marina to sit out & do some people watching while enjoying a refreshing drink.
,,Modern and well presented,3.0,,"We were in Singapore during the recent burn offs in Indonesia which caused polluting cloud to cover Singapore and make walking outside Hazardous. In this regard we welcomed the opportunity of walking through the Marina Mall shops.
The Mall is beautifully presented and there are shopping outlets to meet any need you may have. It even has access to the MTB"
,,enjoy from marina bay sands,3.0,,best place to watch the water show is from a balcony on marina bay sands. these are on the shopping mall level so need for a room. the walk across by bridge is also quite fun
,,This looks high-class,5.0,,"It is worth a visit, this mall has been the famous place in singapore since its opening. The architecture looks really nice, the interior is fancy, not to mention the stores. When I was there, they held a tv show some kind of celebrity awards and it's really crowded. This place is easy to access, you can go with MRT and directly go to the mall. Try the canal boat if you have the chance."
,,2015 #1 Shopping Mall in the World,5.0,,"Fantastic Over the top Labels Galore !!
Just do it - Too survive It ***
Wow what a collection of Designer Label shops we are talking the best of the best in the world right now all in one place with new themes and original shops"
,,Good place to cool down if already in the area,3.0,,"Worth a stroll around to get away from the heat and humidity outside. There's plenty of reasonably priced eateries in the lower level, public toilets and the MRT station. Although very smart, clean, etc, it's a fairly soulless place."
,,All under one roof,5.0,,"Every shop you need is available in the Mall. It is connected to the main Marina Bay Sands hotel and also convenient MRT and taxi access. The mall itself is huge and has mix of shops from ordinary to very high end. Mall is well structured, bright and pleasant walk. Very nice eatery section with range of local outlets. Large casino also connected to the Mall."
,,Stop by,4.0,,"Stop by if you have time, but Marina Bay is similar to any other district I visited in SG, same shopping outlets"
,,Nice mall for luxury shopping and dining,4.0,,Marina Bay has all the luxury brands in one gigantic mall. Loved shopping and eating there. We ate at Bread Street Kitchen by Gordon Ramsay. Its casual dining but the place is really cozy with great view and food is simple but spot on. The mall is also child friendly with lots of place to rest.
,,Disgusting food,1.0,,The mall is fancy but avoid the food court! Floating in grease and with 3 tiny pieces of left over chicken it certainly did not match the picture. Avoid!
,,A good place to hangout,5.0,,a very good place for a weekend activity all the brands you name it you can find there. a wide variety of international shopping experience locally
,,Venice in Singapore! :),4.0,,"What makes this shopping center unique and interesting among the multitude of shopping centers in Singapore is this lovely, long canal (the length of like the full length of a side of the mall) inside where you can take a leisure boat ride (man-rowed) from one end of the mall to the opposite end while going past the stores on both sides (but can't get off like at a store you want along the canal!). On a wall along one side of this huge mall are also big black-and-white historic photographs of the city, and in one spacious corner of the building are tons of over-the-counter food stalls of all varieties with plenty of chairs & tables in front of them.

Just outside the mall, on the side by the water (Marina Bay) is a tree-lined area with like three rows of palm trees, and it was a pretty surreal feeling walking among those trees in the evening after dark with lights coming out from the ground. That same side also offers quite a panoramic view across the water including the 40-to-50-story highrises of the central financial district, the historic Fullerton Hotel with the iconic Singapore Merlion in front of it and 'the Durian'; and walking a little to the right will bring you to the view of the Helix Bridge and Singapore Flyer. Also, in the evening at 8 pm and again at 9 pm, there's a light, water, laser & fire show in the water just about 20 feet away from the edge of that side by the water outside the mall; it's only like a 10-minute show but you'll find it quite memorable! :)

The best way to get here is taking the MRT to Bayfront station (blue & yellow lines) which is connected underground both with this place and Marina Bay Sands hotel across the street from this place."
,,An amazing showcase,4.0,,This is an absolutely awesome shopping-mall. It is huge and a top-notch luxurious heaven with all the world's best brands. Needless to say it is also an expensive place but it is worth visiting. The Marina Bay Promenade outside is very pleasant. There is a water show in the evening with a cityscape backdrop.
,,"""Top shoppees in singapore""",4.0,,"Top shoppees in singapore. Here there are 5000 above brands and shoppes with exclusive items The shopping here is very expensive but worth i had purchased watches, dress & bags from here. Regards Sri (stunningshri@yahoo.in)."
,,Nice Mall convenient tp the Marina Bay Sands Hotel,4.0,,Great selection of shops near the MRT and Marina Bay Sands Hotel and Skywalk. Interesting choice of brands.
,,Expensive shopping mall,3.0,,Super atas mall! Only go if u are extremely rich and can afford all the branded stuff there! But this place is definitely worth a visit in ur lifetime!
,,Very Good to visit,5.0,,This is a wonderful part of Singapore to visit. The Marina Bay hotel and shopping centre have plenty of shops and restaurants.
,,Worth a look!,5.0,,Worth a look. Light show at night is great. Food court downstairs a good option for a less expensive meal. High end shops but good for window shopping or purchasing if your budget allows! Other higher end restaurants located here also. MRT located within Shoppes. Worth a visit.
,,Overhyped And overpriced,2.0,,"the shops here are all designer, up market brands. If you don't have a spare $10k then don't bother coming here. Food outlets are very expensive as well. To me it seems a little try hard in its appearance."
,,how much??,3.0,,"Prepare to spend. Pay. But in return, a luxurious experience awaits. The brands are well known. Names that you'd find in international magazines. Then there are also local brands and services. Posh, high class and surely not for the average."
,,Wonderful mall,4.0,,All your designer shops under one roof on multi levels. Boasting wonderful air con too. Food court very reasonably priced with a good selection of mainly Asian food ( odd bit of Italian but the stuff I ordered was microwaved and not good) indoor ice rink also next to the food court. Good to visit as many attractions near by too.
,,Luxurious but reasonably priced food,4.0,,"This mall is know to host 270 luxury brand stores, but if you just want to get a feel of this and have a good meal at the same time, go to the food court. It's full of reasonably priced food stalls of different cuisines."
,,High End Shopping,5.0,,Great place for high end shopping and see the night shows on the river and in the Marina Bay Gardens. Lovely relaxing evening.
,,Luxury at a price,4.0,,The shops are all big brand luxury names. The atmosphere is one of opulence. Nice to stroll through and do some window shopping and get out of the heat. There are connections to Marina Bay Sands as well as the casino.
,,Take. Breath of cool air,4.0,,This place sits below one of the most expensive hotels in Singapore so you would not be surprised to find luxury brands in the shopping mall. Good food court although better exist in Singapore very few coffee shops and not a Starbucks in sight.
,,High End Shopping,4.0,,"We had 10 days in Singapore so plenty of time for sight seeing and shopping. Marina Bay shops are very impressive, all the top end brands under one roof. The mall is multi-level and beautifully done. You need a lot of money to shop here as you would expect. It is cool and a nice way to spend a few hours looking unless you are a serious shopper with plenty of cash. We came back at night and had dinner at a Restuarant on the 57th floor, unfortunately very over priced. We spent S$300 for two small mains and two glasses of wine. We had no view due to the heavy haze, that was very disappointing."
,,Good place to shop if looking for branded items.,4.0,,Good place to shop if looking for branded items. Can chill out at the Vietnamese cafe or TWG cafe. Good places.
,,Looking for luxury goods? This is the place!,5.0,,"If you are a luxury addict like me, you will love this place! Looking for Italian brand? The sexy Versace, fun Moschino, hip Dolce & Gabbana, subtle Armani, eccentric Prada, playful Fendi, elegant Bottega Veneta, classic Gucci and many more you can find it here! The French labels Hermès, Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Dior, Givenchy, Balenciaga, Christian Louboutin, Saint Laurent, are there! Rolex, Piaget, Richard Mille, Franck Muller, Audemars Piguet, Cartier, Bvlgari are welcoming you with their latest collection! It is heaven for luxury addict!!!"
,,Luxurious Shopping Mall next to MBS,5.0,,"This is a great big luxurious shopping mall based at the bottom and across the road of Marina Bay Sands.

Full of high quality and top brands, great for some window shopping, luxury shopping or simply a stroll through the mall.

An array of eateries as well but may be a bit pricier than normal.

The Casino also has several entrances in the building here.

,,huge mall with luxury goods.,4.0,,"what a mall. This has to be one of the largest I have seen. All the exclusive brands were there, no discounts... The foodcourt was also good."
,,High-end Quality shops & Superb Gardens!,5.0,,"One will find good local food available in the Food Court area. Several good cafes along the lobby area. There is an ice-skating ring and a casino (free entry for tourists, passport is a must). Between 2 rows of high-end quality shops is a man-made canal with Gondolas providing rides for a fee. In the evening you get to see a Laser Show projected onto the marina which is simply fabulous. Highly recommended to those with 2-3 hours to while away especially if you love gardens too."

,,Shop till you drop,4.0,,"Its an upscale shopping centre with Hermes, Chanel, LV, etc..... While the ladies do their shopping, it is always good to sit down & enjoy a cuppa especially at TWG. Dinning choices vary where there are food courts available or the trendy restaurants available within the complex building. There is a water feature where you can enjoy watching and also a Venetian gondola faking the row-a-boat ride for a fee of course."

,,Just lovely,5.0,,Nice upmarket shopping. Be warned this is not your everyday shopping for most of us. But really enjoyable all the same. If your lucky enough to treat yourself to something special this is the place to do it.
,,If you ever wanted a watch,5.0,,"This is perhaps one of the ultimate shopping malls. Connected to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. It features a tremendous selection of high end shops with maybe every designer name you can conjure up. No bargains here. We were struck by the sheer numbers of wrist watch brands with their own shops here, everything you can imagine from the thousands of dollars, to Swatch. Lots of places to eat, with a great selections of cuisines."
,,Do not dare to miss in Singapore,5.0,,"Ur Singapore trip is incomplete if u have not been to this place. Evening is the right time however u can go there anytime.u can spend 1 full day there. shop n dine in the day, stroll around the promenade in the after noon , Take a river cruise experience and watch colorful evening laser/water/music show.

,,HIGH TECH SHOPPING,5.0,,Absolutely high tech shopping and the hotel is amazing to look at. More photos for me. Some bargains can be found.
,,Huge and expensive,4.0,,"Amazing selection of goods at sky rocketing prices. It is fine if you are a tycoon or a recently overthrown dictator, sorry, I mean prime minister from the neighberhood! :-D"
,,Branded and not recommended,3.0,,"Everything is branded and expensive here. There is a good place where you can have all-you-can-eat called Todai, which are our favorite."
,,HUGE SHOPPING FOR THE MEGA RICH,3.0,,"A lot of the shops you can't get into because they are closed door for the wealthy. Huge shopping centre has some good shops that we liked like guess, Victoria Secret and even for the guys a Ferrari shop. Has a very very very small 7/11 store for anyone staying at Marina Bay Sands. If you are looking for everyday shops this isn't the shopping centre you are looking for but well worth the visit."
,,Great Place for shopping,5.0,,"Great and Luxurious place for shopping in the heart of Marina Bay Sand Singapore.You can find every Famous and luxury brand there and Great view of City centre, Every evening at 6:30 they have free water fountain show outside of MBS.Best place for shopping with Amazing architectural"
,,Shopping Heaven!!,5.0,,"Was lucky to visit the shops here on a number of occasions on my visit as my friends live in Singapore and they always bring me here!
The staff in the shops are completely different to the ones in England that are rude snobby and obnoxious the reason I shopped a lot at Marina Bay! I wasn't dressed too well either I looked like I walked out of a rubbish tip but this didn't seem to bother the staff at all.Always does in England as you feel you have to dress up to go in any designer shop! My friends and I had been walking around all afternoon and it was extremely hot!
Well what can I say we visited Louis Vuitton Island Maison the staff greeted us with open arms offered us refreshments and nothing was too much trouble. I was concious of how I looked , yes I looked terrible but they didn't have any care in the world! They were fabulous! We were there for a total of 5 hours and yes we bought a number of handbags thanks to our lovely assistant Coco! The shop is just amazing that sits on the waterfront it has a jetty where boats can moor in if you want to stop by and shop! Just fab! I love it ! London LV take note !"
,,A WOW PLACE IN SINGAPORE,4.0,,"With high end shops all along the Mall and casino at the other side, this place has gourmet restaurants and bars - connected to the MRT, this place is like a mini wonderland with a small canal and boat ride to enjoy in this place. A high end shopping place as you require loads of money either to shop or go to the casino"
,,Go to Orchard road if you have little time !,3.0,,"Go there if you want to visit Marina Bay Sand , otherwise don't waste your time! Nothing you have not seen before especially when compared to the shopping in Orchard road ."
,,Window Shopping only!!,2.0,,It's beautiful & worth a look. But unless your a celebrity or millionaire then you won't be buying anything. The food courts not bad & it's pretty cool seeing canoes in a mall!
,,"Overrated shopping area, lots of high end brands",2.0,,"This is a large complex of shops as part of the hotel complex with many high end brand name retailers including Chanel and restaurants including Gordon Ramsay's The Bread Kitchen. If you want upmarket shops, this is the place for you. Otherwise, head elsewhere."
,,Good quality place to shop and walk around!,4.0,,"Very accessible from its MRT station in the basement, this high end mall is awesome. They even have small gondolas to take you through a short water way within the mall, would be enjoyable to kids. There are restaurants here of celebrity chefs like Gordon Ramsay, Wolfgang Puck and Mario Battali. Boutiques of famous brands are also everywhere. Their food court, Rasapura Masters, holds a lot of different cuisines from other regions/countries but most have reasonable prices, meals enough to fill you up but not put a huge dent on your budget. I also liked their waterfront boardwalk where we were able to just sit down and watch the light and sound show for free! It also has a sky garden on the 4th floor where you can go up and have really good views taken with your camera of the Singapore flyer, the highway and the Marina Bay Sands hotel. The walk also can lead you through a connecting bridge towards the Gardens by the Bay."
,,Struggling between average and very good...,4.0,,"Why?

It depends on what level your shopping is at. ..

If you into normal shops and brands...this is probably not the place for you

If you into high end brands....it's the place for you...but unless you staying at the Sands hotel or nearby...the same brands can be found at orchard road

If you want to walk around and sightseeing.....sure why not..."
,,Shuttle bus,3.0,,"With most high-end and foreign brands here, this can be a good place to go to during lunch. Nicely designed and new mall and a shuttle that takes you back to Marina Bay Link Mall which is very convenient!"
,,Average for Singapore,3.0,,If you have visited the Orchard Road then this area is small repetitive and there to make money as part of the hotel rather than be a self sustained attraction.
,,Worth a walk around the Shops,5.0,,"Spend a bit of time here just browsing as most of the shops are very high end and very expensive. Did venture into some of them but nearly fainted at the prices.
Best was the canal with the boats at the bottom of the shopping centre. If you have time take a ride on them as it is like being in Venice. Just missing the tenor & the musician.
Magical place"
,,Amazing place to While away your time,5.0,,"Shopping, Eating & Shopping....... You will spend hours here. Singapore does tourism so well with lots of activites to do and places to see."
,,Best Spot in Singapore,4.0,,"Funtastic View , Good Service and Great Location. shopping downstairs is the best idea ever. they have a man made garden next to the hotel which is also a must visit. if you want the best view, here is the best spot"
,,Typical Shopping/Restaurant complex but with Casino.,4.0,,"Shopping complex with variety of brand stores, restaurant or even Casino where many Chinese from mail land rush into. The quality of restaurants is fairly good and lots of choice though price is bit high side."
,,Wow! Phenomenal...wish we had more time.,4.0,,We called in here towards the end of our day mainly to avoid the rain. We barely looked at the shops because there were so many and we were making our way back to our hotel for our late lunch. The shops are the high end designer shops predominantly but the stand out feature is the canal and sampans inside the Mall. Something that you would expect to see in Las Vegas. A great range of shops and if I'm ever back in Singapore will definitely spend longer browsing.
,,Spectacular,5.0,,Great walk around the Bay with lots of shops and restaurants. Breathtaking views with a skyline like Hong Kong & Shanghai. Stay in a hotel with a room overlooking the Bay and watch the lights at night. Ritz Carlton was our choice.
,,upscale shopping center inside the Sands,5.0,,"if you are looking for high-end and luxury brands, this place fits you. The shops are conveniently housed inside the Marina Bay Sands. MRT and bus stations stop at this landmark so visiting it is very convenient. There is even a boat ride and skating rink inside."
,,Worth a visit ... and some coffee and cake.,4.0,,"This place is a bit above my local shopping centre.. by a long stretch. It is at the higher end of the retail environment with some serious brand names that are outside of my league but I think that just adds to the experience..

The canal and boat ride were a bit of a novelty, but at $10 SGD per person, you're not likely to do too many trips up and down the canal.

The highlight however is the food court, (Rasapura Masters). It's a akin to a Hawkers market, but in a shopping centre and with air conditioning. It's a cheap eat, for some beautiful food (as you come to expect in Singapore..) and was enough of a drawcard to pull us back in on another day when we were at the nearby Gardens By The Bay."
,,MB,5.0,,"Singapore Jewel, Truly Must Visit Place once visit Singapore. architecture excellence. is here to experience"
,,Came to Eat but an impressive place,4.0,,We came here for Din Tai Fung but the Mall its is good. The products sold for the most part were well out of my pay packet but overall this is a very nice place. We did buy up in TWG but outside of that we at inside twice. This is a very high end mall so unless you have plenty to splurge I wouldn't expect to buy much here.
,,Good modern mall with nice canal and good restaurants,4.0,,Good modern mall linked to the Marina Bay Sand Hotel and conference complex. Nice canal in the mall. Nice restaurants and food courts in the mall.
,,good from outside dont enter,3.0,,"If you are not comfortable with crowds then this is a place to avoid. (actually most of Singapore is)

when I visited the conference area, there was a church gathering on Sunday afternoon, and it is hard to believe the crowds that had gathered there, and that sooo many people could be accommodated in the conference centre. They actually had blocked three of the four escalators for people to come down, and asked folks to wait. It was difficult to move around.

Also the taxi waits in the hot gummy weather can be insufferable as you might have to wait standing for nearly an hour (better to go by the MRT) as the taxis also come very slowly, and some of them break the rule by picking passengers at the drop off point.

there is a canal in the shopping area, but my immediate impulse was to instead get out as the crowds freaked me out"
,,Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands,4.0,,"This is a chic mall attached to the iconic Marina Bay Sands hotel on the Promanade. Find the best global brands here. Plan a visit by the metro landing at the adjoined station to time it with the light and sound show at the Promanade. Ride up to the viewing gallery on Marina Bay Sands hotel. Take a look around the mall in a boat and end up tucking in great food at multiple options. If have more time, land up early and see the Arts and Science Museum too."
,,shopping,5.0,,shops are amazing as some of the brands i have never heard of them but nice to see them .the best place in singapore every weekend.
,,Stroll Around Bay,4.0,,"Marina Bay is chillaxing place for window shopping, sight seeing and open fresh air stroll. I usually hang out with my friends here or meet up to just relax as ambience is superb. Easy access and more sites to see. Perfect for me."
,,Nice food court,4.0,,"Really huge shopping center,by my opinion better than Dubai Mall! Nice smells there,lot of premium marks and really very good food court with many possibilities of noodles,dumplings,seafood etc!"
,,Shopping center like no other.,4.0,,This is a great place for people watching and gazing at all the wonderfull high end goods on offer. Better to go later as not much is happening in the AM.
,,Huge!,5.0,,"This is a huge shopping centre, that's well- linked to the MRT service. There are cafés and restaurants you can eat at. The inside is very nice with a channel going through the mall. On the channel you can hire a gondola like in Venice. There are so many shops in there... everyone is going to find his or her shop!"
,,Stunning views,4.0,,Definitely worth a visit to the viewing deck - the views are stunning - you can have a snack and a drink at the top. The shopping mall is very nice.
,,Loved the shopping and food,5.0,,"We came here several times to window shop and eat - our small children have never been to a large city or a luxury mall. There is heaps to do, everything is shiny and expensive and there is sheer unlimited choice of food. Would recommend even if you are not normally into city breaks (we aren't)."
,,an awesome place but expensive.......,5.0,,I could not believe this building.mdine on the roof or swim or shop . One wonder of the world. Loved the shops too.
,,Luxury plus,5.0,,Oh my goodness there was every fashion shop you could imagine with plenty of delightful places to eat as well. the boats along the indoor river was an amazing sight to see.
,,A very impressive complex.,4.0,,"We easily spent most of a day and evening in and around the precinct. There is a lot on offer, even if it is just to catch a glimpse of how the other half lives. There is a spectrum of restaurants ranging from hawkers to fine dining; designer label retail outlets; casino; a theatre; SkyPark and a host of other attractions nearby."
,,going shopping,5.0,,"if going to the shops is your thing then this place will be paradise there are lots of shops high end and average prices all in air conditioned comfort the even a canal with gondola,s and a large waterfall that spouts from a glass cone on the level above have some lunch and watch it and the world go by .."
,,Something for everyone,5.0,,"From high end fashion shopping to an affordable food court, and everything inbetween, Marina Bay Sands is an amazing place to shop or just browse. The forecourt is a great place to just sit and take in the sights around the bay."
,,Gateway to Santosa Island,4.0,,"Good variety of shops and the place to stop over on the way to or back from the island. The mono rail is on level 4 and not so easy to find. It is a bit of a walk but you can use your metro card. It closes at 4 pm.
The cable care is outside the shopping centre. The ferries to other countries leave from here as well. There is no ferry to Santosa Island"
,,"Posh, beautiful high end mall worth a visit....",5.0,,"This has to be the most posh, most beautiful & most well designed high class luxurious shopping mall here. And its huge too, with huge choices to match.

Every known high-end international brands seems to be here. Shopping here is Definitely for the well off.

Ambience here is just great. Even if you don't intend to buy anything here, come for the ambience experience. This place is linked directly to Bay Front MRT station - so very easy to get here.

Besides The Shoppes, other reasons to come here include the Casino, Skypark & the ArtScience Museum."
,,Best in sin,5.0,,"This is the best shopping mall in Singapore to my opinion, its very modern and luxurious, it has many brands, cafes and restaurants, time flies there."
,,Nothing for me.,3.0,,"I was amazed from how big the place was and how many luxury brands were present. However, I could not afford most of the stuff so I ended up walking around watching the windows. The place is very well connected to the mtr station and besides the shops it has several restaurants that looked more affordable, a theatre and a casino inside. You can also enjoy a gondola ride on the small canal inside or look at the artificial waterfall."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,A great range of shop's in a lovely atmosphere. Very expensive though! Plenty to see and do including an ice rink!
,,"Very quiet, very expensive and very avoidable",3.0,,Interesting to a point but to be honest I can't say I actually saw anyone buying anything in the shops here (or should it be shoppes?!) There were all the usual designer brand names including a floating Louis Vuitton shop outside! There is a canal of sorts running through parts of the centre but again I saw little use being made of it. We used the centre to cross through to access the Gardens by the Bay which was probably its most useful thing for us. Shopping centres are on every corner in Singapore so there are these attempts to make something different but I wonder how sustainable this one is. Not sure that the Beckhams come here every weekend to boost trade.
,,"A must do, but not for shopping (unless you are super rich!)",4.0,,"This shopping center is just waouh ! Super clean, perfect temperature, not too crowded... The only problem is that it is full of shops that are way out of my budget (Gucci, Dior, Prada, ......). I would appreciate a bit more affordable shops. So fo shopping it is not the best, but for a walk and for the experience, it is a must do !"
,,Shopping,5.0,,"Marina Bay is a lovely place to walk around and admire the Bay, the Lilly ponds, various artworks or the lovely helix bridge or just sit and have a drink and watch the world go by.

If you are into shopping and top labels then Marina Bay Shopping is a must. Take your money with you as all the top fashions and well known brands are represented there. Enjoy the inside water feature where a huge glass dome fills from the outside and then cascades down at regular intervals into a manmade canal feature complete with gondoliers and yes you can take a ride on them if you wish. You can put your kids on the huge faux ice rink and hire blades for them to run around on while you sit ringside and enjoy a drink or coffee and keep an eye on them.

Or if you are a gambler then take in the Casino also in the Marina Bay Sands complex but rememeber to take your passport with you and the little Singapore entry card inside it to gain admittance (residents have to pay to enter) passport holders are free.

If you want you can take a ride to the top of Marina Bay Sands Hotel and enjoy the view from the boatshaped top on the public viewing deck - something we have yet to do so I am not sure if you have to book this experience because I think numbers maybe limited and weather conditions apply....worth finding out first. I will be doing this on my next trip to Singapore..... So manythings to see and do, I love the place."
,,Impressive venue,5.0,,"Designer shopping in a beautiful building. Plenty to spend your money on, both luxury goods and delicious restaurants. A dry ice rink at one end and a casino at another, Theatres with great shows and music performances. A fun way to spend time by the marine bay."
,,More of an attraction than anything,5.0,,"This place is filled to the brim with fancy shops, fancy restaurants with a food court and a gondola to boot. However, this is also one of the more expensive places in Singapore, being more eye-candy than anything, unless you come here determined and with big wades of cash, along with an iron-will to spend as much as you can. Seriously, a gondola ride, I have heard, is in the S$70 range.
In conclusion, please visit this marvellous mall with a man-made river flowing through it, and with gondolas and a huge fountain that looks like a toilet bowl, but leave your wallet at home."
,,Lovely place for shopping and dining.,5.0,,Lovely place for shopping and dining. Their little gondola will make your kids have a unique experience sailing inside the mall (while you are shopping).In the rooftop you can see a great city view and they have a big ponds filled with big koi fish that your children will love. Watchout for the strong wind upthere.
,,Beautiful Shopping Centre,4.0,,Every name brand shop you can think of is here. The Centre is beautiful both inside and out. Service in the shops is not pushy but retrained
,,A must visit,5.0,,If you are into luxury brands and designer labels this is 'a must visit' when in Singapore. Most of the 'shoppes' are unusually large by Singapore standards but it's not just all shopping as there are numerous eateries and watering holes. It can get very crowded at weekends and parking even on weekdays is horrendously expensive.
,,Nice breezy walk in the heat. Forget about shopping there,5.0,,"Well laid and spacious. There is a good cool feel about this place. I can't say anything about the prices except that the Apple Shop there are staffed by idiots, who knew nothing about MacOS except that the price of the items & payable by credit card."
,,Rude Rude Rude,1.0,,"We were at the food court on in July 26, at 7p.m. It was so busy like a train station that patrons had to scramble for the tables or to wait for other patrons to finish their food.

My feedback is that one of the food outlet selling Indian cuisine and operated or run by some Mainland Chinese was extremely rude. I had asked for chicken breast (in the curry chicken) and he plonked a piece of chicken back on to my plate and in the same process splattered some curry sauce on my shirt. He rudely and abrasively said "" Ee yang tet' (meaning the chicken breast and chicken back is the same.) I told the man off about his lack of manners. If I had not paid for my food and rushing to catch ""LKY,"" the theatre performance, I would just walked off. The food outlet should teach their workers or operators some basic courtesy.

I would not return to this outlet again."
,,Luxury at it's finest,4.0,,"A visit to Marina Bay shops are a must. For most of us, the shops are way out of our league but it is lovely to see all the beautiful clothes and jewellery on display. There is a gondola that goes down the main waterway. There are many cafes, coffee shops and restuarants to spend sometime just relaxing and doing some people watching."
,,A bit of everything,4.0,,"Lots to shop for here, from the very top end of town (and a very complete range at this end too) to the everyday shops, everyone should find something here. There is a great range of restaurants, the food court seemed to be quite reasonable but it was crazy in there, people everywhere right through the day so we avoided this and headed to a restaurant instead.

The gondola ride is a gimmick, 5 min ride for $10 per person, all of 100m at a guess! Ice skating rink could be fun for the kids, but its full of kids who can't skate so anyone who can would avoid anyway.

Easy to access via MTR, bus and taxi."
,,High brands!!,4.0,,A lot of shops !! and some of them closed very late night. you can use about whole day for discover this mall.
,,"when you like walking, do it",5.0,,Live the 22nd century when walkiing around the Singapore Marina Bay. Will take you about 3 hours starting at the Lion fountain and back over the bridge from the shopping mall opposite the big Marina Bay Hotel. Amazing journey.
,,The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands,5.0,,Shoppes at MBS is a huge shopping area. You will get to see all renowned brands here. Some of the prominent local brands are also here and one of them is Risis. Risis makes jewelry from Orchids. Its a must buy thing at Risis when you visit Singapore.
,,The Shopping and Restaurant Paradise,5.0,,"A wonderful stopover when you fly into my garden city ... The Shoppes at Marina Sands is a Must Visit.

Floors of shops from branded goods to eateries of varied cuisines and Michelin chefs have opened shops to its patrons delight.

You can get a membership card to accumulate your rewarding points as you spent and will be able to enjoy redemption when you reach certain points. Approach the customer desk and you will be advised how to get it together with a photo taken."
,,Another Great Mall,4.0,,"We were staying in the hotel so we have easy access to the mall. We actually went into the mall everyday for 4 days to look for food, restaurants, shop or just hang around. The architecture of the mall was nicely done. Three levels of various shops and restaurants with high ceilings. Easy to navigate around the huge mall. You can also take a Sampan ride inside the canals in the mall. The place is loaded with high end shops as well as mid-range franchise stores. There is also a food court, 7-eleven and pharmacy if you need one. We ate at the food court twice and we had some Indian and Malaysian foods and they were delicious at reasonable price. The food court has a lot of variety and choices at budget friendly price. It is right next to the skating rink. We also had dinner on different dates at Mario Batali's Pizzeria Mozza as well as people's favorite Din Tai Fung. Nightly in front of the shoppes by the bay they have the Wonder Full Light and Water Show which is a must to see when you are in the area. Overall we enjoyed what the mall has to offer."
,,Lots of things to do,4.0,,"This mall has everything. All kinds of branded shops, big food court, dreamy boat ride in the middle of the shopping centre like in Venice, Casino, Hotel, MRT Station, wonderful Water show. It also has a connecting over bridge (Lion Bridge) that goes over the road where you can view the Singapore Flyer and connects to the gardens by the bay. You can also view the Garden Rhapsody show from this bridge."
,,A quick run around will not do the mall justice,5.0,,"European high-fashion brands at Asian prices - event some wiggle room on prices....... I bought some Maui Jim sunglasses over £100 cheaper than in the UK. Don't rush, incredible bargains to be found."
,,Great Shopping Mall,5.0,,"Great place to find a luxury brands. From clothes, suitcase, watches, sports, you name it. Located next to casino and hotel, its a good place to hang out with your partner, you can also take a walk outside, seeing the city from the other side. Its good to visit at night time, during the day weather could be too hot. They also have a great verity restaurants. Many world famous chef open their brands here, you can have a nice quality dining with your partner on special occasion. Food court also available on the lower level, but price range is higher than the standard food court in Singapore."
,,Just another commercialized district,3.0,,"More shop, more restaurant, etc. Not sure what the fuzz is about this place, but I rather go to the older parts of the city like the back alleys of China Town to find something interesting."
,,Great place to shop till you drop,3.0,,"Great place to stay and shop, we didnt go to skypark because we lost touch of time due to the shopping sale at the basement of this place to esplanada, so many choices to shop and sit down have snacks, really shopping haven of singapore."
,,Interesting shopping mall,4.0,,"We visited these shops twice on our recent visit to Singapore. The MRT station, Bayfront, is within the complex.

We expected the stores to be out of our price range however, unexpectedly, we found a few good buys as on the lower floors there appears to be stores which are more mid-range.

We found it an interesting mall to wander around and had a light lunch in the food court."
,,Just another Shopping Centre,4.0,,The shops are good with all the designer labels there but basically it is just another shopping center.You can go to the Casino from the center or walk to the Gardens by the Bay. There are some good Restaurants in the Centre
,,Good branded shopping,4.0,,"Great place to look at luxury brands, esp watches. Not so good for everything else. Nice shopping experience and you don't really have to buy anything!"
,,Girls' Shopping Haven,5.0,,It's a haven and heaven for people who love shopping. It's so classy but unassuming. It carries all the brands that we're familiar with. We practically closed the mall 2 consecutive days because we couldn't get enough of it.
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,Visit this shopping centre but the best time is at night where there is a free light show. See the awesome water fountain.
,,Everything you need under one roof,5.0,,How big is this place?! There are so many levels and different wings it would keep you busy for days. There is something for all ages and price range. There is even an ice rink next to the food hall.
,,Classy,4.0,,"A very interesting complex. ..
A great food hall with an average price of $10 for a great feed but can get extremely busy making it hard to get a seat.
Just about every expensive brand name resides within this building so makes for good window shopping especially when you spot a $500 000 ring on display.
There is a little river running through the middle with gondolas and the most fantastic water feature that only runs at night when the gondolas have finished for the day.
You can also go outside to beautiful views across the Bay."
,,A place to max out you credit card $$$$$$,4.0,,Its worth a visit to wander around a dream or take a boat ride down the middle of the shopping centre like being in Venice. Some good eating options and ability to get there with the MRT a bonus.
,,"Luxury Shopping, with a great food court and lovely views of the River!",4.0,,"High End Shopping, and very convenient, as you enter it once you come out of Bayfront MRT station.

Beautiful place to walk about, but it will make your wallet very light if one wants to shop! We visited Sephora and Victoria's secret (one of 2 places in SG with VS) and ate at the mall which had delicious food, not too expensive, and a great variety! Great for big groups of people (we had 9 in our group!)"
,,Mostly very high end brands,3.0,,"Not the place to go if you are looking for authentic Singapore. This is a very high-end shopping center and the place to go if you are looking for a Chanel bag, other than that, not much interest for Europeans looking for Asia."
,,5 out of 5 for high end shopping,5.0,,"Fantastic building with a great mix of highend outlets, designer chief restaurants through to cafes and a foodhall. The casino, theatre and art science museum are all great things to add to your shopping visit, or extend the day by doing the gardens by the bay or catching the view from the top of the marina bay sands buildings.
Look to join the sands rewards program its free and all over the place, you need your passport if visiting. There is some good discounts for the shopping and other associated events or venues like the theatre or art science museum."
,,Shop till you drop.,4.0,,They have a shopping paradise. All shops you will find in Singapore and more. Three floors with a small canal in the middle.
,,Nice,5.0,,The shops are very nice but bring your pocketbook or credit card ready for some pricey purchases! The atmosphere is good.
,,Expensive but worth a visit,4.0,,the shops here are mostly High End with all the main Designers having outlets here. generally very expensive but worth a look around!!!
,,Impressive mall,4.0,,"Cool, clean and luxurious, this is a very high-end mall attached to the amazing piece of architecture that is the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Hardly surprising then that it's full of very stylish, very expensive stores. This mall was quiet compared to others we passed through and the shops weren't at all busy but even if you can't afford to shop, it's worth a look.

A Venice-like canal in the middle with gondolas ferrying people up and down (mostly families with children needless to say!), the world's only floating Louis Vuitton store (it isn't, just an optical illusion depending on where you view it from although the water does lap feet from the entrance), a Ferrari on display in their menswear window - all here at The Shoppes complex along with fancy eateries as well as more affordable ones, theatres, a skating rink, a museum etc.

It's worth a look if you'e in the vicinity and, like most places in Singapore, is easy to get to by MTR."
,,The Luxury End of Town.. But There is a Great Food Court!,4.0,,"Marina Bays Sands offers a lovely mall filled (mostly) with high end boutiques / stores, however, we did pick up some great sale items and the more mid range stores..

There is a cafe which is positioned right under the water feature which is nice to sit at. After your snack/drink go up to the top of the water feature and if there are two or more of you stand on opposite sides of the dome (which holds the water) and whisper to each other.. The noise travels across the dome to the other side!

The food court in the mall is great, we especially like the BBQ pork buns from the dum sum outlet.

My daughter also tried the ice rink (which is actually made from plastic) and had a ball.."
,,Luxury shopping,5.0,,This is the most luxury and beautiful shopping mall in Singapore which is located at the heart of Singapore. There are different types of luxury brand in this mall. It's also very accessible with its mall connected to the MRT station. There are also different restaraunts in this mall and as well as connected to Casinos. At night there are also lighting performance outside the mall which is very beautiful.

,,An impressive shopping centre,4.0,,"Majority of Singapore's shopping centres are predictable, ie same brands are found and crowded. The Shoppes, however is less busy and has designer labels for kids and a skating ring. It is bright, airy and a great sense of space. It is also next to some stunning architectures."
,,Another Luxury Dome,4.0,,"Grand from outside and possibly one of the places having huge luxury brand stores. But again in today's world, its a not a novelty to find malls with huge luxury brands, but worth a visit to possibly visit stores of all brands which come in your mind"
,,Very Fancy.,4.0,,"The thing I most remember about this shopping centre is how wonderful it is and I didn't spend any money.
This is a great place to see with the gondola rides going up the middle and a Ferrari race car in the window of Ferrari Store Men's Wear or the Wonder Full Light And Laser Show twice a night.
They do have shops here not found in Australia.
But as for shopping and food for a Aussie in board shorts it had nothing for me.
Very Clean."
,,Pricey in every way,3.0,,We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands hotel and so decided to check out the Shoppes. It's just what you would expect to find in a shopping center in a five star hotel - high end shops with high end restaurants run or owned by Michelin starred chefs. Everything is pricey as they all sell luxury brands. It's still a nice place to visit though and there's a hawker's center where you could get nice and filling meals.
,,Family Reunion at Singapore,3.0,,"Too much expensive! Too much crowd! Basically these are not the shopping place at all. But as a place this is Fantastic, Fantastic View."
,,Best place to shop luxury brand,5.0,,This is the best place to shop the luxury brand in singapore its just a shoppers delight all the big brands at one place makes an easy shopping experinec

,,Too Expensive,3.0,,"The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands was a very clean and pleasant mall to walk through, but in my opinion the shops were too expensive for my family and I. But in saying that, there are a few shops that are in our spending money budget. Though if you have the money, I do recommend this shopping mall."
,,Good Chinese restaurant with dumplings,4.0,,"Restaurant that makes dumplings at the window is outstanding. Good value and a fun time for dinner. Soup dumplings are the best, but the fried rice is also really good."
,,Little Venice,5.0,,"First off, there is a little Venice in the shopping centre!! I was so impressed, only $10 to go for a little ride in the gondola. Lots of shops and perfect place to escape the Singapore heat for a while.!"
,,Fun to look,4.0,,Lots of high end shops fun to window shop. Casino there. Nice restaurants and across the road from gardens and marina bay sands

,,Bonanza,5.0,,"The shops here are amazing, best watches, jewellers, fashion and other shopping all side by side offering massive choice all in one place..."
,,Great if you're looking for luxury brands,4.0,,"I tend to window shop at The Shoppes as the brands are mostly high end with a high price tag to match. If you're looking for luxury items then this is a great mall for that. It has a good feel to it, being relatively new it is nicely air conditioned with some great eateries around."
,,Beautiful Marina Bay,5.0,,"I have visited this area several times and still enjoy staying there. There is so much to do, lots of shopping, plenty of food establishments, Suntec shopping mall is great. Nice clubs with good music. Loved visiting Marina Bay Sands shopping centre. Cant wait to go back next year."
,,Attractive center and restful surroundings,4.0,,This is place where a lot of tourists gather for the ambiance and great surroundings. It is modern and full of life with high quality shops in a spacious setting. Easily accessed by all forms of public transport.
,,Gattaca of South East Asia,5.0,,"Every year I visit this charming city-state, and everytime I visit I am half expecting a rocket ship launching from somewhere in the city - it is that modern and futuristic, especially the area around marina bay sands, very sci-fi in a pleasant way, check out the gucci shop in the bay and you'll know what i mean...."
,,"Great views, shows, deck and eateries",4.0,,"Took a break and spent the evening at the Marina Bay mall after a long conference day. The mall isn't the best organized but attractive, comfortable and clean. Plenty of places to eat from a large food court to fancy dining. On a nice day, the views of the water and business district are wonderful and there is a good crowd taking it all in. I'm sure the retail is silly and expensive like any mall in Singapore - especially one attached to a casino - but not my problem..."
,,marvelous marina bay,5.0,,Breath taking architecture. Make sure to take time to observe the pieces of sculpture art that are dwarfed by the impressive building. Shopping is expensive but its high end. The dumplings in the food court are fab.
,,Really good mall,4.0,,"I went there with my wife after spending all the morning at the gardens and we had a really nice tike walking throughout the stores (there are very expensive brands but also normal ones so you can satisfy every need).

We grabbed a bite at one of the many restaurants they have and loved the food....I recommend it if you have time to spare.

At the end be sure to go out to the bay so you can take really nice pictures."
,,Amazing views of the city,5.0,,You can view the magnificent skyscrapers of Singapore from the Bay where there is one of the Merlion statues. Plenty to do here so well worth a visit from shopping to eating to attractions. Loved sitting on the stone steps taking in the scenery - wonderful.
,,Must see for all travellers,5.0,,"Excellent place to be in the evenings, the light & sound show is the best seen by me till date at all places, a shopping paradise with all world know branded stores, nice place to take a stroll and view Singapore skyline... and not to miss the restaurant at the top"
,,Nicest Mall I Have Been To,5.0,,"There is a gondola ride in the mall. Something you would not expect, but so this mall's style. You could get lost in all that it has to offer. It is a mostly high scale mall, but there are a few cheaper store thrown in. It is worth a visit to see it all even if you do not buy anything!"
,,Nice To Look & Too Expensive,4.0,,"The Shoppes is the shopping mall at Marina Bay Sands.

Take the Bayfront MRT and you'll arrive right at The Shoppes. It's a shopping mall with expensive and fancy brands mostly. So yes, it's nice to look and see but they are too expensive. There is an area at the lower floor with regular shops.

You can also take a gondola ride at the canal there. The most interesting thing at The Shoppes is the artwork display called Rain Oculus."
,,It's a trail of memories....,5.0,,"You have got a whole lot to do here. The high tech laser show, the shopping experience, food court, fabulous hotel and the skypark. This is all in one."
,,Go Here!,5.0,,"This complex beats even Dubai for slick world class shopping, restaurants and service delivery.
You will need to book, there are 2 restaurants on the top level, we went to C'est La Ve where they serve modern Asian fusion. It is some of the best food we have ever had and wonderful attentive service.
Watching the red sun set in about a 90 second time frame was spectacular.
The bar is great and it's ok to just go for drinks."
,,Marinas Bay Shopping Centre,5.0,,Centrally located at Bayside MRT. Kids will love the Sampang ride in the shopping center! Great Laser Show in evening.
,,Excellent,5.0,,"I have rated 5 stars because this is truly an excellent and modern shopping mall.

It is however, too plush for the common person, as this is a high end mall with mostly expensive designer shops. Nice experience though.

Even the restaurants we found almost too expensive and not worth eating at.

Comments/tips: If you are on a bit of a budget and can't spend 300-400dollars a meal per person, then note that there is a 7eleven shop with decent sandwiches etc. Also there is a nice pizza restaurant at the beginning of Marina Bay, which is less pricey than any restaurant at this mall."
,,Night Time Shopping.,5.0,,Just hop on a train to get there from anywhere in the city for great shopping and entertainment or a bit to eat.
,,Huge mall for fancy shopping,3.0,,"I only ever end up at The Shoppes if I happen to be catching a show at the Theatre. The place is filled end to end with the more pricey retail options, from branded goods to expensive art galleries, as well as higher end restaurants like Wolfgang Puck's and Daniel Boulud's oyster bar. There are more affordable options on the lower floors, but those seem to be overflowing with patrons at all times of the day."
,,Marina Bay,5.0,,"One of my best place where i usually go for shopping and for enjoying out with friends. Here's you can see lot of Skyscrapers and Tall buildings which is usually you can't see in City Centre of Singapore. There also got lots of place where you can hangout with your friends, One of them is Marina Bay Sands where you can get anything you want like shoppings, Gambling, and On the back there got Gardens by the Bay which is the Best of them as well. Please do visit if you're visiting Singapore.. Happy travel"

,,FAVORITE! Modern & Classy,5.0,,"This one is one of my favorites! The view of view is calming, especially at night during the light and water show. The view of the Merlion and other tourist spots are well located. :) Mall, stuff are pricey but could still give a high rating. Casinoooo!! One of the coolest places I have ever been. :) Wouldn't mind to go here everytime I am going to visit SG. Much love for this place! Also, a lot of Filipino employees. Made me feel like I am home away from home."
,,High End Shops,4.0,,"This shopping mall is represented by most of the top global brands in clothing & watches. Mostly, items are expensive. Interior design of some of the shops are worth appreciating. It is a good mall to visit & experience in Singapore"
,,Amazing but $$$$$,4.0,,An amazing shopping strip! Has a gondola going through the middle! Large range of expensive shops with not too many people there! But too expensive!

You will need them to shop at Cartier, Armani, Fendi, Boss, Louis Vitton.

You can ride a boat from one end to the other and go on a synthetic ice rink, casino, theatres etc....... Nothing Cheap
Even Macaroons at TWG are $2.00 each and they are gone in One bite. Best value Chicken rice at the food court $7.00"

,,Miles of shops to see and visit!,5.0,,"This is the shopping mall of the iconic MBS - Marina Bay Sand.

Speaded out over 3 floors, you can walk miles and miles (and definitely burn lots of calories) if you walk all the corridors.

If you are a shopping fanatic, you wouldn't be disappointed, with the many boutiques here. The LV store here is both iconic and unique, worthy of a visit!

There are also cafes and restaurants for you to pause for a quick cuppa or meal."
,,Fantastic Views and Shopping,5.0,,What a fun day exploring Marina Bay and the shoppes by the Sands! It was a hot day out but the indoor mall provides for a great time killer.
,,Huge shopping mall,4.0,,Very huge shopping mall with so many shops and restaurants. Daylight through atrium along the shopping area. Imitate indoor venice canal.
,,A really nice luxurious shopping mall in Marina Bay,4.0,,"This is a super high end all i the same category as the Dubai Mall of the Avenue Mall in Kuwait City. It design is modern and open, and you can enjoy a beautiful view of the Marina Bay skyline.

Natural sunlight illuminates the interior of the mall through glass windows.
There is a canal where you can take a boat ride through the mall.
All fashion brands have a shop there, some of them very impressive.
The food court is very comprehensive as well.

You can go there by MRT and spend half a day visiting this mall as well as all the other sites of Marine Bay."
,,Rather luxurious mall,4.0,,"This mall seemed to have everything from a skating rink to a very glamorous central water feature. The shops ranged from high end designers to main stream retail, indeed something for everyone. The food court was also great (although lacking in western breakfast options) with many local cuisines to choose from. A great place to spend a few hours of you're in the Marina Bay Area."
,,Modern architecture,3.0,,"Since I come from Jakarta, I'd say the mall sis average and a bit dull, compared to malls in Jakarta. It also has somekind of quirky installments inside.But at the terrace, it offers great city view during noon or nite and sometimes there's a music performance fountain at nite."
,,Very luxurious shopping mall,4.0,,"You can find most of designer stuffs there. I like it the mall has a nice ambiance. I also like to go out of the mall and enjoy myself there. Love almost everything about MBS except ""Price"" :)"
,,Dreamin',5.0,,If you want to see nice stuff that's probably out of your price range - go to The Shoppes. Fantastic array of designer labels and up-market merchandise in a truly spectacular shopping centre. How many other shopping centres can take you on a boat ride within the complex? The fountain/waterfall is amazing too. Go there for breakfast in the food court for a delicious range of Asian and western breakfast options at reasonable prices.
,,Favorite late night hang out,4.0,,"Apart from its rather pricey parking fees, who could dislike the shoppes with its endless shops, beautiful view, weekend night's water show, right next to the casino, convention centre & senic attraction gardens by the bay, a stroll down the linkage bridge from the shoppes to the hotel right down to gardens by the bay is a must do ard 5-7PM to enjoy the cooling evening breez & sunset view."
,,SHOP TILL YOU DROP...,5.0,,"Here, under one amazingly glass roof of the Marina Bay Sand Shopping Malk, is every single possible fashion brand in the world! No word of a lie!

Now the only shop that i wanted to walk into was Tom Ford of course! Call it obssesion, love, pure fashion desire...but I literally flew half way across the world to come and buy his Mens facial products range. Much to my huge disappointment and shock, Singapore doesnt supply or stock it At All people!

Let me just say I would of needed a cheque book from Tom Ford personally to buy any item in there!
However I simply opted for a nice scented body moisturizer instead...

Name a brand and you will find it!
Remember to bring a Saudi Prince to settle your numerous purchases.
To just window shop is just slightly depressing.

If you love shopping, expensive brands, this is your shopping Mecca.

,,Beautiful but concrete,4.0,,"Our photographs came best in Marina Bay area, but there was no natural beauty here, all man made. Shopping is decent here and foreign gamblers have a Casio nearby to try their luck (passport is must). If one is on budget here and also wants to enjoy nice food, don't eat in those fancy malls. Do little footwork and one will find plenty of food court style areas in Singapore, they are cheap and serve tasty food."
,,Luxury on display,4.0,,"Large shopping mall with a man-made canal with gondolas for hire. On displays are shops displaying various famous luxury brands. A good place to cool down, look look, see see, even if you are not buying."

,,wow!,5.0,,"marina bay in its entirety is super great...shopping... eating... and the night fountain show. everyone should not miss marina bay. the only thing is when you shop, its expensive because everything is branded"
,,Gucci or what!,4.0,,"This is a splenidn place to visit if you want to check out the designer scene for the world. Basically, if you have not got a branch here, you can't call yoursellf a world player. Crazy money for the goods on sale. But don't worry too much - a lot to see, including the people walking about, and it is fully air conditioned. We had an excellent (and affordable) lunch in the Japanese/Chinsese restuarant on the ground floor, and this was absulutely superb. Didn't get its name, but the sign outside stated it was voted one of the top ten restaurants of the world by the New York Times! I am not sure that is true, but the food is well worth a visit."
,,Nice,4.0,,Nice shopping - pretty much most brands that are globally recognized have a presence here. Not necessarily cheap - but good collection.

,,Luxury paradise,4.0,,Spend your time for an hour to roamed the huge shopping mall for a nice window shop but bear in mind that all shops in high rated and not consider any bargains. Enjoy the architecture and the food court near the ice skating rink.
,,"Varied and full of shops, etc",5.0,,"Basically a combination of mall, casino, outdoor activities (see the free laser show at night). We felt very safe and secure walking around and the abundance of retailers will keep a shopper happy."
,,A nice place to eat.,4.0,,"The food court here was the last place we ate at in Singapore and the selection and prices rivalled any of the other similar places we had been to.
A much more or organised centre than many of the 'hawker style' eating places.
If you prefer a more conventional eating experience you should try here."
,,Walking/shopping and running venue.,5.0,,So big and every shop you could want is represented. Enjoyed my morning run around the bay before the retail day had started. A must visit on any trip to Singapore. The light show at night is also something to experience.

,,"Huge, huge shopping mall not necessarily worth a visit",3.0,,"Huge, huge shopping mall with a lot of people window shopping but not that many actually in the shops. All the luxury brands are here under one roof but it seemed like people were more interested in the regular restaurants and food court than in the luxury brands.
Walk towards the waterfront and there are great views of the central business district.
The connected casino requires your original passport for identification."

,,Marina Bay Shopping,3.0,,"There is a huge shopping complex below the Marina Bay Casino and hotel, but make sure your wallet is full. Shops are all designer brands, so don't expect too many bargains. However, it is nice to window shop and there is lots to see."
,,Very posh,3.0,,This mall was the poshest mall we had ever been to. It had more high end stores than I knew even existed. The air conditioning was very welcome.
,,At the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands,5.0,,"Christmas Time Shopping and Lunch.

After the River Cruise, we decided to go for Shopping and Lunch at Marina Bay Sands.

It was Christmas time and the whole place was decked up very well. Had a leisurely lunch and then started to walk around the place.

The main attaraction was the Christmas Tree and the Raindeer Sledge giving a festive atmosphere to the place"
,,WOW,4.0,,"You can look at photos of this area but you really have to see it. The hotel is truly one of a kind. there wasn't a thing we could think of that wasn't in the shopping area. There were no price tags on articles in the shops. if you wanted to know the price you probably couldn't afford it! well, we couldn't anyway.
The put on a light show at night which is a must see if you are in Singapore."
,,Nice,5.0,,Nice Shopping. Less car park. Good food court. Its big for no reason. Not compact. Too much walking.
,,Luxurious,3.0,,This place is only someplace to come if you are happy to just windowshop or if you are happy to come and spend lots of money on your credit card. All these shops are super high end and not discounted in anyway. Expensive but worth a visit.

They have 3 shows during Fridays & Saturdays which is at 8:00pm, 9:30pm and 11:00pm. It is free and open to public. The shops are very expensive and all we could do was window shopping! :D"
,,Fancy or what!,4.0,,"Let's not beat about the bush, this is high end shopping. If you've ever heard of the brand ( and I mean top brand) it's here in spades. Try the Ferrari store for everything branded with the F word at breath taking prices. If that's not good enough, perhaps the Lambourghini store will do? Or try a gondola down the mall river? Life's tough here - at least on the credit card."
,,High end shops but a gorgeous setting,4.0,,You don't have to come for the shops. The mall itself is beautiful and worth the visit. There are plenty of restaurants and the subway stops in the basement which makes access very easy.

,,Lots of options here!!!,5.0,,"The shoppes @ marina bay sands is a great location and very accessible.Most of my break time at work,I use to come here often to shop. The La Sensa brand for ladies is very affordable and if you are a member then you can avail a big discount twice a month.
The Saphora is great for make up things. Overall I love this place, even though lots of branded shops are here they still have lots of shops that is affordable to everyone. And by the way the gong cha tea is here as well. Great for everyone!"

Very clean, and the people are really friendly wherever you go."

,,Pleasant experiece at Mastercard Theatres,4.0,,"I just wanted to drop a note for the commendable and warm service by Violet, your usher at Mastercard Theatres located in The Shoppes @ MBS.

I was one of the guests at the Beauty & The Beast musical on 27 March (Friday night). Before the musical, I had a buffet dinner at Todai restaurant at MBS and ate some bad seafood. Even though I rejected the dish upon knowing so, I still felt unwell 2 hours later in the midst of the musical. Hence, I made several trips to the ladies' and on my 2nd-3rd trip, Violet asked if I wasn't feeling well. I explained to her about the buffet, and she was very understanding. Luckily, I was seated at the end of the last row of the dress circle and it was easy for me to enter and exit. But, I had to use Door 11 instead of 12 as 11 was nearer to the ladies'. Violet was situated at Door 12 and another colleague of hers at 11.

During intermission, she saw me outside and asked if I was feeling better. I told her not really, but I was pretty embarrassed at having to slip in and out of the theatre while the musical was going on. She said to me, ""No worries, I already notified my colleague (at Door 11) that my guest is not feeling well.""

I feel that service these days are not very personable, but Violet bothered to ask after me and she made the night a little better and even notified her colleague about it. Please do let her know I appreciate it very much.

Thank you!"

,,must see,5.0,,"A huge , excellent shopping mall with a lot of branded goods and a walking distant with the best is the music ,water and light show at 8 and 9:30 nightly. See it from the side of the water where the hotel is on as this is the best view. Don't forget to stop and see the Merlion , just about 20 mins walk from the marina bay!"
,,"Good restaurants, crazy building",5.0,,"Outstanding seafood restaurant here. And the Buildings. Singapore looks like it was designed by Frank Gehry on LSDA--curves everywhere. Here we have three towers holding two thousand rooms, joined at the top by what looks like a huge banana with trees growing on it. Very weird. You have to see it to believe it."
,,Very good view,4.0,,"Good view from the top, could see singapore from the open balcony. Could sit on the floor and enjoy the view peacefully. Snacks and drinks were available, there was a bar too, one can buy souveniers too. Must visit the casino"
,,Amazing,4.0,,Really amazing place almost all the designer stuff under one roof available here. But bear this tag in mind that it is really expensive too.
,,Good foodcourt,5.0,,"MBS has a good foodcourt, it could be pricey though in comparison to other foodcourt establishments in Singapore. I really liked the Indian food and Dimsum at the foodcourt! Good quality, fresh and tasty! I will definitely go back for the Indian and Chinese Dimsum food!"
,,Great Variety of Shops!!,5.0,,"We were staying at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and this is the closest mall to the property. It is actually part of the Marina Bay Sands complex along with the convention center and the casino. The mall is connected to the hotel by access through the lower level.

We found two small but well stocked convenience stores where we purchased our soft drinks and snack items for our 10 day stay at MBS. This is a smart thing to do compared to the mini-bar option! There is a small 7-Eleven located on an upper floor and several small convenience stores (including two pharmacies) located near the food court on the lower level. This saved us a heap of cash since we were staying at the hotel for fair while.

Overall the mall is expansive, beautifully laid out and has many upmarket stores but also offers a great variety across the board. The mall has an indoor skating rink as well as a large good court where we ate a few times. The variety of food available is impressive and the quality was good.

There are lots of small coffee shops where you can take shopping breaks.

Linked to the mall is the MBS convention center which offers a great business center open to anybody. Prices for use of their facilities was quite reasonable!"
,,shop shop shoppe,4.0,,"Right next to MRT and Convention centre. Multi floors, crisp and clean look and feel. There are a large numbers of dhops here, many designer labels and nothing cheap. Ironically it did remind me of Westfields Pitt Street in Sydney, except that does not have the great water feature (see photo). Definitely a good option if you are staying at MBS - of course if you are then price is unlikely to be a deterrent for shopping!"
,,Heaven,5.0,,Loved the peace and serenity of shopping here compared to orchard road. Everything that I was looking for was here and there are great food choices and even some ice skating if you want!
,,Modern,4.0,,"What makes this shopping mall rate high is what surrounds it. Gardens by the bay is in walking distance and a gorgeous water and light show takes place right outside each night at 8 and 9.30pm not to mention river cruises, casino, taxi rank, theatre and hotel. There is a lovely boardwalk outside that is lovely to walk on. My major problem is the food court. Instead of being in a central position in the mall its right at the far end and by the time you walk there it feels like forever. There is an ice skating rink next to the food collet too. You can also hire a boat and row along the indoor man made river. A big transparent dome in the ceiling has water flowing through it into thenriver too which is cool. Many shops are pretty expensive and desgner but not all.

Will come in the future as its so close to a lot of other great things"
,,Nice mall,4.0,,"We walked around this mall a few times. First time was because we were there to eat at Din Tai Fung and had spare time. Another time was to cool off on our walk to the flower dome. Finally, we went one more time because my daughter wanted to shop - we didn't find anything she wanted. The mall is nice. Many high-end shops. There is a casino, and this seems like a nice, large mall for people wanting to blow money they won. Much more reasonable shops can be found on Orchard Road (and there are hundreds of shops there)."
,,Very fake and forced,3.0,,"If you like luxury shopping and nothing remotely real this is the place for you but if you want to get an insight into Singapore and get some real life do something else, anything else!

That being said we went to see the DaVinci Exhibition and that was amazing so it does have it's merits"
,,Great spot to see the Singapore skyline,5.0,,"Marina Bay is the large bay side area east of the downtown core; connected to it is the Marina Bay Sands hotel and the high end mall. There is a food court at the bottom of the mall with reasonable prices. Although I didn't come here for the shopping, it was still worth a visit, as this was a great spot to see the Singapore skyline on one side of the mall! On the other side of the mall, you could see the night time light show at the Gardens By The Bay."
,,Vert nice area to walk around.,4.0,,"Nice to walk around especially if you have a reason to be there,we went to the museum to see the DaVinci exhibit. Shoppes as they call them are primarily luxury brands and the whole place is very sterile."
,,For the luxury set,4.0,,World class shopping area with luxury brands and prices to match. Interesting to be able to enjoy the facilities.
,,The view of the light show from the building over 'bay over the gardens' is a must see!,5.0,,"The shoppes are great place to spend a couple of hours. It's easy to walk around most of the levels and see the view of Singapore from all different heights and levels. It's incredible to see all the upmarket stores and the canals running through the middle. I'd highly recommend walking out to the view point and seeing 'bay over the gardens'. The light show began after sunset, approx 7pm when we were visiting and it was great watching the lights and music show. The viewpoint was very busy by the time the show started so I'd recommend going earlier in the evening if you want to get a place to sit and watch the show."
,,Very fancy,4.0,,"Something different to experience the high life with all the high end stores. Food court wasn't great but was still cheap enough to eat. Was amazing to see the stores like Gucci, YSL and Hermes"
,,"Expensive, Minimal Inventory",3.0,,"Multi level, very high-end stores within Marina Bay Sands. Marina Bay Sands Mall is known for it’s high prices. I was told they cater to and price towards the folks who leave the casino after winning a lot of cash. The majority of stores were well-known American, British and Italian brands. One notable point is that the stores had very limited inventory per square foot."
,,Shopping extravaganza,5.0,,If you like shopping in a beautiful waterfront setting this is the place. All the name brands are here and less congested than Orchard Road.
,,Very upmarket!!,5.0,,"We did loads of shopping here (unfortunately window shopping) in this magnificent centre. Most of the shops are high end designer shops. The centre is ultra modern and very up market. It's also massive!! There are canals going around the centre that even have boats that you can have a ride on around the centre!!

Take the downtown or circle line to Bayfront which is the mrt stop located in the centre. It's located in marina bay and close to all the popular attractions Singapore has to offer."
,,"Good shops, food court",4.0,,Lots of high end shops in the Mall. Noticed a lot of the shops didn't have many customers but Mall very busy. We ate in the Food Court. You buy your food from one place and drinks from another and just sit at one of the tables. It is also very pleasant to walk around outside the mall
,,Shopping,5.0,,All the finest and best under one roof. Not just famous well known brands but also quality merchandise. I liked the food court best a you can observe them making your food!
,,perfect shopping,5.0,,One day is not enough to visit all the shops. All international brands can be found with some cheaper options as well.
,,What a stunning mall,5.0,,"If you have the cash, you can certainly splash big time in this beautiful & pristine high end shopping mall. Every designer who is anybody is here & all seem to be selling. Mall is beautifully set out & has a nice spacious feel as its well set out over several floors which are linked with escalators & elevators. A beautiful shopping / browsing experience."
,,High end shopping mall,5.0,,"All branded products are available in this mall. The best part, they close at 12 midnight. Shopping can be done after 10pm as compare to orchard shopping belt.
Restaurants here closed late too. The Korean Todai is here too. Super good buffet spread but a bit expensive. Worth to try."
,,All malls can learn from this,5.0,,"A wonderful mall with nice eateries, waterfront entertainment, great architecture and views on all sides."
,,Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands,4.0,,"Shopping center with many shops for all tastes. The architecture of the center is beautiful which includes a small artificial river where we can go boating and even a casino. when I was there also were preparing an ice rink.
It is worth to visit and enjoy the center."
,,Another luxurious shopping centre,4.0,,"Another addition to the many shopping centres in Singapore though this one is more luxurious in outlook with plenty of branded goods stores available. There's a gondola ride in the middle of the centre, though they called it ""sampan"" (malay for little boat), it costs S$10 per person, entertaining for the little ones.

Like everything in the centre, I noticed the foodcourt is also much more expensive compared to other places. Disappointing as the taste doesn't support the price. I would not eat at the foodcourt again if I don't have to. I prefer to spend the equivalent money to sit in one of the cafes."
,,Not much variety.,3.0,,"Sporting goods shop there had many bargains - swim wear, sports wear, shoes…. Also liked the little supermarket - Cold Storage - can stock up on snacks and fruits for the room. Most of the other shops are high end luxury goods stores. You're better off taking the train to Orchard Road or Scotts Road area for more varied shopping and bargains."
,,All the great shops in one place!,5.0,,"If you want all the big and luxurious brands under one roof this is now the place to be, very spacious, clean and nicely decorated. Best of all it is not so crowded as some other places at Orchid Road. Worthwhile a visit if you are in town!"
,,A Relaxing Mall to Window shop,5.0,,"The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands really is a very big mall that contains a lot of stores, attractions and restaurant. I love it here, I visit it three times when I was in Singapore. I love the atmosphere, you could just walk and enjoy the atmosphere. I even love the food court, Rasapura Masters, it has soooo many good Asian food there. Love it so much! Will do come back everytime in Singapore :)"
,,Something for everyone,4.0,,"Large walk area, means no jostling. For a man who spends a lot of time outside shops more seat would help but at the same time they have a little Venice boat ride you can enjoy or the amazing inside water feature. So for all the men out there you can actually see things at marina Bay Shopping Center while time go by on your life spent at the front of stores, hoping the wife is not spending inside. Good luck with this."
,,Shiny and expensive,3.0,,"The weird spelling of shops is sometimes used to evoke an old time charm, though why had it been chosen here I can only wonder. There is nothing old or charming about The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands that reminded me of Dubai Mall. They're huge, ostentatious and sometimes borderin on kitch, the small river at the lower level with an actual gondola being case in point. The mall is clean, air conditioned ad it's nice to do some window shopping, or even shopping, if you can afford it. For any mid-range tourist I would recommend Orchard road for more affordable options. If you're a guest at Marina Bay Sands, go and have a look, otherwise don't bother."
,,World Class Designers In One Location,4.0,,"Bigger Stores and Better Selection of similar designers, less busy compared to the boutiques/shops along Orchard Road"
,,Huge mall with lots of activities in addition to shopping.,4.0,,"It is possible to do lots of shopping there in mostly high-end shops, but in addition there is an ice rink there, it is possible to hire a gondol there and there is also a big selection of Places to eat. It is very pleasant to go there and cool Down after walking outside in the hot and humid weather."
,,Great Place for Rich Shopaholics,4.0,,"This place was definitely on my list to visit - the range of shops is phenomenal to say the least! Hubby and I had a wonderful and relatively cheap lunch in the Food Court which is situated on the bottom floor. The variety of food on offer is fantastic with plenty of seating available.

After lunch, hubby returned back to our hotel because he is not really into shopping. The Shoppes is definitely a place you could spend all day. Most of the European and American designers have stores here, with Bulgari and Louis Vuitton having their flagship stores located here!

I have been purchasing from European designers for over 20 years, and I was in my element as being an Australian, we still have many designers who do not have a presence back home.

However, what I found, was that yes, most designers are here, but they have limited ranges (which is what I have found elsewhere in Singapore) and not necessarily the latest collections. Also, the prices are higher than in Australia for the exact same goods. I was wanting to purchase a Bulgari ring, but found I would have been better off to purchase it back home. I was also told whilst in Singapore, that only tourists shop in Singapore because it is no longer any cheaper - this is definitely the case.

I did splurge at the CH Carolina Herrera store on some exquisite high end costume jewellery in the end. This is one designer who I love, but who is still not available in Australia.

The Shoppes is very well laid out, massive (so wear comfy shoes) and is definitely worth a visit, but you need to be very wealthy to do any serious shopping here!

At the end of the afternoon, I was so exhausted, I was fortunate enough to get into the Banyan Tree Spa (located in the Marina Bay Sands Hotel Tower) for a massage which rejuvenated me!"
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,"A very large variety of shops, only 1 money changer, very well hidden. After a full day of Orchard Rd shopping I can tell you that you can find almost everything here (except maybe an Abercombrie). Prices are the same as Orchard Rd, some shops great value, some not so great... Depending where you're coming from... For sure worth a visit for some fast and efficient shopping. If you are staying at the Marina Bay Sands do the shopping after you check in as you might get some special deals."
,,"A nice, expensive mall.",4.0,,"We've been here a few times. Lots of designer shops to choose from & high street brands thrown in too. The mall is big & it's easy to get confused in! we went to the skating rink area & visited the good court which is nice. If you like designer shopping, or window shopping you could easily spend the day here.
Tip: there's a 7/11 at street level at the South end if you need to get your EPS card topped up!"
,,Decked for Christmas,5.0,,I was expecting a few shoppes beneath the Massive Marina Bay Sands Resort and Casino and was overwhelmed by the number and quality of shoppes. One could spend an entire day browsing. The Ice Rink was closed as it was set for Christmas and Santa's village. The Food court is equally amazing and offers many delicious foods from all nationalities.
,,A very high end mall,4.0,,"This mall has all the high end brands. Some are so high end that I never even heard of them. The mall itself is very nice and spacious It connects to the Marina Bay Sands hotel, the casino and the Art science museum."
,,Get an eyeful. Plenty to see and do,5.0,,"The Shoppes is part of the Marina Bay Sands complex which comprises the incredible Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Casino, convention and exhibition facilities, theatres, entertainment venues, retailers and restaurants and an ice skating rink.
At a cost of $4.7billion USD I guess you expect something spectacular.
The Hotel is the other side of the road and easily accessed.
Trains, buses and river taxis also stop within easy walking distance.

Everything here is BIG.
B-I-G!

Big ticket prices on most things too.

High ceilings and wide walkways make this a very comfortable place to be even when it's flat out in Peak Season.
If you're on a budget then you'll only be going here to LOOK!

Shoppes features many of the world's elite designer brands and has a Gondola ride on the bottom level($10pp).

There's also a great food court on the bottom floor with plenty of choice.
Plenty of toilets too and, like the rest of the centre, absolutely spotless.

The Rain Oculus is close to the water and is a bit of fun.
On the outside, upstairs on the second level, you'll see a stainless steel frame and a 22m wide acrylic concave cup that fits neatly into it.
There's a series of jets that pumps out water at 6,000 tons per minute everyday at 10am, 1, 3, 5, 8, 9:30,11pm and it all goes down the gurgler.
I've seen it referred to as the worlds biggest plug hole :-)
That's not too far from the truth.

Outside;if the the water's not running you'll see plenty of people trying to score a hole in one throwing or rolling coins into the big plug hole in the middle.
Inside;you'll see all the water cascading into the canal at the bottom that the gondolas use.

As an insight into lifestyles of the rich and famous this is as good an introduction as you'll ever get."
,,Great shopping and food,4.0,,"What a great choice of shops and eating places within this huge modern complex. It is so large that it can be easy to get lost, you can also easily visit the adjoining malls without leaving or crossing roads. The food eating places on offer are different with loads of variety on offer. Well worth a visit."
,,Expensive but nice,4.0,,An amazing mall definitely work visiting. Lots of luxury shops with loads of designer brands. Great food court on the bottom.
,,Fabulous food court,5.0,,Really enjoyed the food court here. Great prices and variety. BBQ Pork Baos were fantastic as was the frappes and coffees. Yum yum yum.
,,Shoppers Haven...,4.0,,"Yes indeed this is a shoppers haven if you are looking for high end brands like Michael Kors, Calvin Klein, Cartier they even have a Harley Davidson shop with an actual Harley Davidson motorcycle on display. Very clean and spacious. I love the Rain Oculous and they also have a huge available space for shoppers who want to enjoy the view of the high rise buildings of Singapore and the Merlion."
,,Raining outside? Spend the time inside the shoppes,5.0,,"We could not believe the selection of stores in this location. It was a great way to stay out of the rain to pop inside, shop, stop, and enjoy."
,,"Spectacular, spacious and a shopping paradise if you have deep pockets.",5.0,,"Visual extravaganza .... all the ""names"" in shopping are there.. beautiful arcades... boating up the alley ... with a partial Venice feel... expensive fit out and on many levels...so take your time and spend a FULL 4+ hrs exploring."
,,If you like shopping...!,5.0,,"I am not a shopper and not at all a mall kinda guy, but this place is amazing and worth seeing. Tons to see and do. Very expensive but this place has got something for everyone. We went mid December on a Sunday so it was very busy. Super clean, felt very safe, great architecture, friendly people. Easy to get to on the MRT. If you want to escape outside for a few minutes, the mall is right next to the water with a great board walk and views. A must see while in Singapore!"
,,Cha Ching But Beautiful,4.0,,"Some reasons I like this mall, although I probably would never buy anything here, is the high tech construction and the beautiful presentation of high end retail stores that lease this space. It is well thought out with skylights, fountains, a Venetian Like Canal with boat rides and a feeling of elegance.

I walked though a couple of levels before going to the food court with local taste sensations. The fake ice skating rink by the food court in this mall is fun and this time was full of Christmas Decorations and Carolers."
,,Shopped till I dropped....,5.0,,located opposite the Marina Sands Complex. One of many but the best of the malls in SIN. Really nice high end shops. Went and bought a lot of new nice luxury items but found to be cheaper than UK. Great customer services. Nice art work (water feature) gondolas and food courts. Taxis can be busy at peak times.
,,Expensive and not worth the time!,3.0,,"The Shoppes is conveniently adjoined to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, allowing for the hotels' many affluent occupants easy access to some of the world's elite designer brands. The complex boasts a rather unique Gondola ride inside as well as an impressive casino, however, those alone, do not necessarily make the Shoppes a place worthy of visiting (that is unless, you live at the hotel next door). Everything is expensive and if you like to shop tip you drop, you might as well do it in style at Orchard Road."
,,Not much information provided,3.0,,"The shopping mall is quite huge, and the atmosphere is rather cold (compared to other malls in Singapore, more ''lively""). Most of the shops are high-end, so unless you just won big at the casino, you won't really enjoy them.
If you desperately look for a specific information (such as where to find a HSBC ATM), you'll go crazy. There are many ""Concierge"" boots, but nobody there to give information. Only brochures and sometimes an interactive screen with the list of the outlets (but not, of course, of the ATM Machines).
If you stay at the MBS, go there by all means. Otherwise, just stick to Orchard."
,,"Good, depends on what you are looking for...",4.0,,"It's one heck of a shopping mall. They have almost all luxury brands available. I think if you go to Singapore, then you should spend at least a couple of hours here, though that wouldn't be enough to see the whole place. If you wish I shop, then you will definitely end up spending more time. The food court has good variety. If you decide to walk by marina bay on your way to the mall, I assure you that it looks beautiful."
,,An Expensive Grandiosity Mall,5.0,,"A huge mall with most luxurious architecture in Singapore. A lot of worldwide brand shops, so that's why the price is expensive. Bring a lot of money or you just entertained by the beautiful architecture or their sampan rides in B2. Some restaurants are expensive, if you want to find cheaper food you can go to food court. I will surely go back to this place again later with more money."
,,Huge shopping complex,4.0,,"Marina bay sands mall

A great mall with a lot of shops across multiple levels. A wide range include major designer labels.

You can also checkout :
- The attached art and science museum.
- The fake canal (like the Venetian in Las Vegas ).
- The swirling water or the evening light show.
- Or walk over to the nearby park and bio domes.

Tip
----
- Have tea , scones and sandwiches on the little bridge over the canal. It's a nice way to take a relaxing break.

- There are also several real restaurants in the mall - not just mall food."
,,Shop here after you win some $ at the casino,4.0,,"Very good mall with all the high-end brands and some medium-end ones. Singapore's only Tom Ford store is here for instance. LV's largest store with an incredible al fresco view with photo opportunities is also here

From here you can connect to the MasterCard theatre, the Sky gardens, and the Art science museum, all worth visiting

Many celebrity chefs are also here, Wolfgang puck, Tetsuya etc."
,,Bring plenty of money,4.0,,This establishment is aimed directly at wealthy visitors with plenty of spare cash to spend. Many high end shops to choose from and a selection of very expensive restaurants (highest prices in Singapore). It's also a good place to escape the heat as you explore Singapore.
,,A little shopping,4.0,,"The shopping centre by the hotel. Wonderful design, clean, air conditioned just right (for me anyway). Every designer label you can think of and there's even a casino downstairs if you fancy trying your luck."
,,lovely to spend evenings or day,4.0,,"i m an indian loved der food court for indian food and nice pineaple fresh juices, the cold storage near food court will get u liquor,milk and bread butter, if your breakfast not included.i wish they had a bit cheaper brands here, else its a good place to window shop and lot of positive energy,even ten thousand dollars can vanish in a zippy if u shop here.but never theless its a beautiful place."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Absolutely stunning. The architecture is beautiful. Inside has so much to offer, with amazing restaurants and food! Take a romantic gondola ride, go Ice Skating. Shop in world renowned stores for amazing merchandise."
,,Amazing view best at night,4.0,,"This place truly depicts the modern, exquisite and glamorous image of Singapore and should not be missed at all. It is a great mall with almost every luxury on earth. A great photo-op destination. Do not miss Sky lounge and Casino is the same compound."
,,"Worth the visit, especially combined with other attractions.",4.0,,"You can easily combine a visit to this Mall with other attractions such as Gardens By The Bay, the Casino, or Marina Bay Sands itself. Yes, there are lots of top end shops (sorry, Shoppes) to be browsed but there are also other lower priced ones as well. The food court in the bottom floor will not leave you wanting more as well - good portions at good prices for Singapore."
,,very nice mall and awesome food court,4.0,,"It's a mall attached to the casino and there are tons of shops and many luxury brands. The food court is very nice, clean and good food choices. They have a light show outdoor at 8pm and 9:30pm and I found it quite boring but not a bad option if you got tired from all the shopping"
,,High end and exclusive,5.0,,Had fun walking around the shops just enjoying the non crowded ambiance as compared to Manila's malls. Did not buy anything as items sold are way expensive for my budget.
,,Strong wifi,4.0,,"Just all I need - strong wifi. Nothing much for me to shop here. Not enough dining options for the masses, perhaps thats intended to be that way. Dining options here are over the top and expensive, even food court too, and crowded."
,,Modern high end shops & prices,4.0,,"This is a lovely shopping centre to wander through the cool aircon browsing the many high end designer shops. There are also plenty of dining choices ranging from casual food court to fine dining, so definitely something for everyone."
,,High End but Relaxing,4.0,,"We came in here trying to take some shelter from a big thunderstorm we got caught in visiting the Gardens by the Bay across the walkway. This has to be the largest collection of high end designers in one location that I've ever seen. Like many things in Singapore it is done on a grand scale. I found it a very pleasant environment to walk around in and window shop because it wasn't crowded with loads of people. Extremely clean and this is where you'll find some of the restaurants with Michelin starred chefs. All your high end is here like Prada, Burberry, Phillip Lim, Armani, Bally, Boss Chanel, LV and so on, but I also saw some relatively affordable brands like Tommy Hilfiger, Ralph Lauren, Guess and Gap. Stay as long or as little time as you like."
,,Amazing!,4.0,,"This is the biggest mall that I have visited. Way too expensive for me, there are so many designer stores. Many of the shops seem to do very little trade but they must do enough to survive. It is a great place to cool down though and the water features are spectacular. Worth a visit."
,,Good place to get a break from the heat,4.0,,"Upscale mall but not unreasonably priced considering the location. Most importantly, they have fantastic air conditioning and free WiFi, perfect for a break when traveling. The restaurants are pricey, but not as excessive as you may expect with the location."
,,More Elite,4.0,,Lovely to look and fantastic brands. Very cool and clean but unless you are in the market for elite brands it seemed very quiet and most shops emplty of customers. Worth a look and of course the hotel and skypark nearby.
,,Wonderful place,5.0,,"Many and beautiful stores, excellent restaurants, very clean place and a very nice view of the bay. Congratulations."
,,Huge and luxurious malls,4.0,,There are many hi end brand name products in the malls and many shops are well decorated. It is really nice to come here in the evening till the night time. I really enjoyed walking nearby the bay. Being chillax with the beautiful light at night. Enjoyed sightseeing the light on the skyscrapers around the bay and took a selfie lol.
,,"Huge mall, house to many luxury brands",4.0,,"Mall is huge, with many luxury brand boutiques & eateries. Restaurants are pricey here. Try the Mozza Pizza, very good. There is also a church running on Sundays at the convention centres (by Joseph Prince). There is a hotel opposite and a huge garden, all accessible via the mall. If you like Louis Vuitton, visit the 'floating' LV boutique here."
,,Huge,4.0,,"This place is ridiculously big, so big I fact we couldn't find the way out! It has a very luxurious feel about the place with all high fashion label available. The water feature inside is interesting."
,,Huge,4.0,,A very nice shopping centre. It is a must see. We didn't buy anything as prices here seem the same as in the UK. But it was nice to walk around and admire the beauty and architecture of the mall.
,,Shop shop shop,5.0,,This is an amazing shopping centre - make sure you take the time to walk around and just browse - the water feature is well worth the wait
,,High Quality Shopping,4.0,,"This is a fantastic mall which has a really impressive eatery within it. The shops are, with respect quite expensive, but you don't have to pay to window shop! The best bit is the eating area where you can enjoy a tremendous selection of fantastic eastern dishes."
,,Amazing mall!,5.0,,"I fell in love with this mall the minute we stepped inside from the waterfront. It's big, immaculate, and has a ton of open space. It didn't feel crowded at all, and had a great selection of stores and food shops (from fancy restaurants to a 24 hour 7-11 convenience store). I loved the canal that goes down the mall, and you can even ride a boat down it! The mall is also connected to the food court, ice skating rink, casino, and hotel. You could really spend hours there!"
,,Everything you need !,4.0,,"This is one place for shopping that you just cannot miss while in Singapore . You have a range from the very top fashion labels down to the basic street food food court . They even have a canal where you can sit in row boats ala Venice and in the centre court in front of Coffee Bean there is a glass roof made into a funnel where swirling rainwater collectively pours into the canal , such a simple good idea and an attraction ( I was there during a heavy thunderstorm for 2 hours ) I noticed at least 5 levels of shops and even the Casino is within striking range ! Directional signage is great , you couldn't get lost here . Everything is linked together , the Hotel , The Shops , The Casino ..... did not manage to squeeze in an external walkabout due to the thunderstorm but nevertheless it should be great too !"
,,"Thick Wallets, Deep Pockets required",4.0,,"The place is full of every branded shop imaginable. I think some very deep pockets and thick wallets are definitely needed if you want to shop here. Even saw one shop called ""Billionaire"" - I wonder what prices are like in that shop? If you want designer items, then this is the place to go; that is, if money is no object. If you want to shop wisely, then I suggest you try elsewhere. But it's still a good experience to see the place and take photos."
,,lots of shopping finds,5.0,,lots of big open spaces even though there is a lot of people it doesnt feel crowded good construction fantastic architecture will go back again with a skating area lots of people at weekends
,,"Posh, innit?!",5.0,,"Exceptionally clean and fantastically appointed, every designer label has a shop here (yet on the streets of Singapore you don't see the opulence). Nice tea rooms. Can get there by subway"
,,High End & Unique Shops,4.0,,The Shoppes at MBS is a mall filled with high end shops and unique boutiques. Found a great Singaporean grocery store as well. Nice casino as well.
,,High End Uppermarket,4.0,,"We reached this place via MRT. The view is awesome outside giving a glimpse of the singapore night skyline. you can simply stroll along, have your meals or enjoy the river cruise."
,,Luxury Mall Complimenting Its Surrounding,4.0,,"This is a luxury mall that really compliment it's surrounding though it lacks the personalised service of ION. For example, as you get drop-off the taxi, there's valet service unlike ION, you're pretty much on your own.

I usually don't really care, but after my fantastic experience with ION for that one personalised valet service, I expect nothing less especially from a luxury mall in one of the most prestigious area in Singapore right now.

However you can't deny this is a prime location for the mall, you get the Marina Bay Sands hotel, the casino, the Garden By The Bay, the convention centre, and the waterfront area which overlooks the Singapore CBD. Then there's the flagship Louis Vuitton building, though not the store with the best LV experience (ION store has better service), it does have some very good design concept.

The food court has plenty to choose from, and there's a skating rink next to the food court, which I personally think is a waste of floor space as it looks rather ugly (this is not a real ice rink by the way).

The shops generally have very large floor area so it's not over-crowded which is a good thing, but I personally think the number of shops are less than what you get at ION."
,,Is that elevator fast,4.0,,"The shopping mall is enormous, with many of the big names present. The elevator to the top is a rocket ship, with your ears popping like in an airplane. Getting to the top, you have a marvellous view of the area, and if you go during the F1 weekend, you actually see more of the track than some one who is at the stands (albeit, with less detail of course). If you plan on having a drink or a meal at the top, just be careful on what you wear, as there is a dress code to abide to."
,,food court,3.0,,There are lots and lots of restaurants to choose from. Many different types of food. Restaurants get very busy around 6-7pm.
,,luxury shops,4.0,,"this is a huge shopping mall, with casino attached. Most of them are High end luxury shops . inside shoppes, there is a paid boat ride through the canal resembling venice style. We had our eateries in the hotel surrounding the canal at ground level and it was worthy for the price( sadly forgot the shop name..)
Best part is it is connected to the Bay sands MRT, which is more conveniet for Transport. Also, evening time there is light n water show in the promenade area. Shoppes is connected by Helix bridge and close to art and science museum"
,,Marina Bay Sands Shopping and Food,5.0,,"Situated under the 'surfboard hotel', Marina Bay Sands has an amazing holographic laser light spectacle display most nights. There are many bars along the quay where you can watch this. This is also a renowned area for A1 shopping, think Louis Vuitton, Tiffany and all the best and unique British, European and American brands. The food hall is to die for, with a classy take on traditional hawker food (@$6!). An easy walk from the gardens by the Bay if that's what's else on the agenda."
,,Convenient location,4.0,,The mall is mainly for those who have money to buy luxury items but since this is near the MRT we usually pass by this to go to Gardens by the Bay. The meals at the food court are nice and grouped according by region so make sure to stop by for a quick bite. You can also watch the Wonder Full Light and Water show at night for free.
,,Shopping for shoppers,4.0,,"The view is beautiful. The shops here are many with a wide choice of branded stuff be it handbags, shoes or clothes. There's a Hard Cafe here too. We can shop shop shop till we drop and with food at every nook and corner. Besides there are theaters for musicals too. It's spacious and big...and all it needs is just a little bit of walking and dough to enjoy and pamper oneself!"
,,"""High End shops""",5.0,,Its mainly for uppermarkets..all the well known brands of clothing and apparels are here..but its relaxing also to stroll around even if you wont shop..its a great place.
,,Giant mall with a mini river,4.0,,"The mall is clean, huge and super nice. There are things to eat, tea shop to have your snack, a gondola ride if you please. Ice skating too!

The only reason I knocked a star is because I really wanted there to be a play area for my toddler. We had fun and he did too, walking around. But I think it would be perfect if they had something like that for all the moms who shop and need a break.

All your brands are there and very convenient by taxi. Really loved how bright it is inside and the concierge were incredibly nice."
,,Huge place multiple options,4.0,,"Mainly for upmarket and mid level shopping. This apart, plenty of Michelin starred restaurants here. One can even take a boat ride in the Venetian kind of canal if you have children (or if you are child like). A big casino is in the same block (take your passport) and of course the stunning M.B.Sands hotel is right across the road."
,,"good mix of shops, but don't take the train",4.0,,"i went here mainly because of a shop that had a store here. unfortunately for me, this shop was one of the few that closed after 10pm, while the other shops closed at midnight. so if you're planning to do some night shopping, call first to make sure that the store will be open when you drop by.

why shouldn't you take the train (and take a cab instead)? because it is quite a distance from the mall to the actual MRT station, although most of it is in the underground portion of the mall so it is cool, clean and you won't get lost. still, if you have difficulty walking more than 500 meters without sitting down & resting, go directly to the taxi stand & queue up."
,,The Shoppes - Superb,5.0,,"Fabulous! Well laid out. Clean. Huge. Almost every luxury brand has a shop here. There are also a lot of lesser known brands as well. Something for everyone. A lot of restaurants - high end, high prices but again well known chefs running the restaurants. There is a cheaper 'locals' food court on the lowest floor. The Louis Vuitton Maison is an architectural wonder. Their window displays are always the best - gorgeous. Did some comparison shopping. Singapore is no longer a mecca for cheap shopping (unless you go outside to markets). It has steadily increased over the years. Compared prices on approx. 4 items that I had either seen or bought in past 2 weeks. All more expensive than NY, Zurich and Paris. (Pity, 'cos I really wanted to buy that Tiffany diamond ring!)
By going to The Shoppes, you also can access the casino, museum, Sky Park and other near by attractions. There is a supermarket and a chemist which is very convenient. The laser light show at night is spectacular. Almost as good as The Bellagio Fountains in Las Vegas. Much better than the Hong Kong harbour light display.
Put aside a lengthy period of time as there is a lot of walking involved and a few levels to see.
Minimum half day is needed.
TIP: Try the TWG tea room for a meal or afternoon tea. Good value."
,,"Fantastic location to shop, but a little pricey",4.0,,"If you are looking for branded stuff, this mall should be on top of your list. I went their several times and feel that although the price is a little steep compared to other mall, but i enjoy the benefits of being treated like a rich. Location wise, it is also very accessible as it is just outside Bayfront MRT. If you are sick of shopping, you can visit the casino too.

I must say a ""never get bored"" mall"
,,Awesome,4.0,,"Clean, branded and luxury shops. Eay to reach, connected to Bayfront MRT station. Going up to L1 level, go out to watch laser show every night at 8pm and 9pm. Prefer arrive 30 minutes earlier."
,,Architecturally Sophisticated,5.0,,At first I was amazed by the size of this shopping mall. The sophisticated design looked so luxurious as well as the brands inside. I didn't shop here since I came late so I just walked and enjoyed the mall. And oh! One problem: taxi queue.
,,Touristy and Convenient,5.0,,"The best place for shopping experience.This place is filled with top brands to mid-end brands, with a huge food court and many attraction inside and nearby, including Casino, Mastercard Theatre, ArtScience Museum, MBS Sky Park and one-kilometre walk to Garden by the Bay.

The utmost plus for this place is its wifi connection, fast and free. I spent my time here uploading photos from my trip as the hotel wifi was expensive to use. The place is so huge that you could get tired of walking. The indoor artificial river was very cool with a half-sphere water ball pulling down water every 30'.

I enjoyed my time here a lot, I visited this place for three times instead of spending time on Orchard, which was quite noisy and less organized than this place."
,,Shoppers Haven,4.0,,"Shopping, be it window or real, is heavenly for those who don't mind spending bucks and bucks on shopping spree. It's a fab, not-for-the-masses, enormous place with a Macau or Austrian feel inside because of gondola-rides along the mini, indoor, man-made canal. (visited March 2011)"
,,Massive Mall Still Needs more Stuff In It,3.0,,"Great to walk through needs more shops though - there are really high end brands and mid high range brands and there is a 7-11 as well ! but nothing compared to Dubai Malls ! They can take a leaf out of Dubai's sparkling malls and put some more life into this . Still work in Progress.
But great for Photo Op's near the bridge outside the marina walk and the bay in front !"
,,MBS is the greatest Feng-shui building in the WORLD. I do not like it as a Casino BUT it is it Feng-shui that helps.,5.0,,"MBS is a 3 Towers Building and slating at 11degrees towards the North with is in fact praying for the good of Singapore in particular and for the World at large.

The offering is a LOTUS Flower which is the Museum Building which we use to offer to our Goddess Kwanin on the 1st and 15th day of each month on the Lunar Year.

The next that you may not believe is the Sky Park which looks like a Ship sitting on top a 57th stories building, is in fact a URN holding the 3 joss sticks up-side down. The joss sticks is up-side down is one of the greatest Feng-shui for if you look at it at an angle, it a Chinese character REN which means MAN.

In 2011 when the building have it official opening on 2/11, A11 human are aged 111. This you add your age to your year of birth and it equal to 111. My example is 30/06/44 is my birthday and adding 67 to 44, I was 111 in year 2011.

The greatest disaster happened on EARTH on 3/11 but few knows about it and it is this Feng-shui that tells it. On the 2nd day after 3/11 disaster, you see a ship sitting on top of a 3 stories building.

This Feng-shui is build to protect Singapore against disaster for Singapore is the DRAGON HEAD on EARTH and that is why we are called the LITTLE RED DOT. Singapore is the only RED spot you can see from the SKY whereas the other RED spot is A11 can see from EARTH and that is the SUN. Singapore is the Dragon Head by it Geography formation of the Biggest and Highest mountain ranges, that is the Himalayas which started in Singapore ending in the Nepal where the highest mountains are.

These just some of the Feng-shui points that I LIKE to share, there are in fact total of 11 Feng-shui in the building itself and that is WHY 11 comes into places for in numerology 11 is a bad numbers and it counters it for Singapore to bring PEACE & VICTORY to Singapore. Believe or not is your own decision, BUT please, do not be stubborn not to believe in Feng-shui. Just a reminder for believer of FENG_SHUI, It is a art in the open only and those who bring a compass into your home and rooms are CHEATING on you as Feng-shui means wind and water and it is in the open, that means structural in the OPEN not enclosed."
,,Up market Mall,4.0,,"Full of up-market brands which makes for good window shopping. The architecture of the whole mall is interesting, there is a river running through one section and you can take a boat trip if you wish. At the end is an intriguing fountain that can also be viewed from outside.

Of most interest to us was the decking outside facing Marina Bay from which you can watch a very clever light and water show that takes place twice nightly at 8 pm and 9.30 pm. Very clever and spectacular. You can see the show from all around the Bay but we felt that it was best from this vantage point."
,,Superb mall,5.0,,"plentiful of branded stuff in the mall. If you are looking for brand stuff. skip orchard road. Go to MBS. but careful on the food. if you are a tourist, food in that mall is expensive. you can't find fast food. a dishes can cost you at least 5USD."
,,Beautiful building and location,3.0,,The shops you can find any where but the building and location are unique. Has a nice food court with an overwhelming amount of choice.
,,An epic masterpiece,5.0,,"Very elite and extravagant shopping experience. Genrally quite spacious with an array of very classy Euro fashion labels. Casino and cinema are close by and it is very good for families. Amazing people watching opportunites abound and a newish MRT option is very close by (you can also catch a river boat). Brilliant setting right on the water but the absolute highlight for me was the amazingly croweded food court - I struggled to get a seat yet thoroughly enjoyed the brilliant and spicy Pinoy food all for $15 Singapore. Totally superb and I will return to shop, people watch and eat!"
,,Beautiful shopping centre,4.0,,"Beautiful shopping centre with a variety of different shops. Good for just browsing as very expensive. Really clean and quiet but very impressive. Venetian style gondolas going through the shopping centre! Perfect location, and just a walk from the business bay, marina bay hotel and the merlion park. Worth a visit"
,,Lovely centre - for shopping and food,4.0,,"The usual clean and organised Singaporean experience, could spend a whole day here easily. Shops to die for; plethora of eating experiences and casino nearby."
,,Beautiful architecture,5.0,,"This place is a beautiful shopping center. Is is big and spacious and has the ceilings are super high with natural sunlight, to me it was just breathtaking, it is very big, it even has a subway station, nice , open clean, with many high end retail. It is just nice to stroll by it even if you don't want to go shopping. I think it is much more impressive than Las Vegas."
,,Upmarket and Expensive,3.0,,This place has all the upmarket branded stuff. Even the Toastbox here is more expensive! Nice window shopping. :)
,,Up-market mall,4.0,,"This mall is located within the marina bay sands casino and housed most of the well known international brands like LV, prada, Chanel, etc.

Basically, it's a mall that caters to a more up-market crowd and many restaurants can be found here. There is also a food court at basement one and parking is ample."
,,Impressive,5.0,,"A very large mall. We visited numerous times whilst in Singapore for nearly 2 weeks, either passing thru the MRT to the Gardens by the Bay or to the Marina Bay area. Ranging from a large food court to specialist restaurants. The mall is easily navigated with directional signs. Shops more high end though. Aircon nice and cooling to beat the heat outside too. Water Taxi stops by the mall too, allowing quick access to other parts of the city apart from using the MRT."
,,Just a high end shopping mall,3.0,,"You will get to find the branded shops here, not all but a variety. I would suggest heading down to Orchard Road though. Parking fee is horrendous, take note!"
,,Marina Bay sands shopping mall,5.0,,"Great shopping, all the brands you could want, lots of restaurants that you can use to save money rather than eating in the hotels, flavours for every palette, very short distance from the Marina Bay Sands, all connected under ground so no fear of getting wet if it rains."
,,Perfect daylight all wallet shopping,5.0,,"This mall is so designed with the glass roof that its a very comfortable shopping experience. It has shops of all price tags both top and main street brands. For the kids there is an ice skate ring, kindergarden and even a real boat ride. 3 levels in 3 directions so take your time to explore. Take the MRT underground Marine Bay yellow line its a great experience on its own!"
,,"Good, not as good as I expected",4.0,,"I went to The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands yesterday. I expected better, I expected more variety. They have a decent range of restaurants. Cut by Wolfgang Puck was tempting but I was out of time and I didn't have a reservation. Maybe next time."
,,Incredible High-End Mall,5.0,,This place is like Rodeo Dr. but air conditioned. It even includes a fantastic food court that is the best I've eaten at. Don't miss the food or you will miss the best part of the mall.
,,So much under one roof!,4.0,,"The vast array of shops available here is astonishing. Although a majority are expensive designer boutiques there were a few choice places that made our trip to Singapore all the more entertaining. Firstly, due to the expense of breakfast at the nearby hotel, we visited Sweet Spot Deli (in the shopping centre, not the Marina Bay Sands hotel). The deli sandwiches were excellent and enormous to boot but had nothing on the size and quality of their chocolate cake. The second place was a confectionery shop selling everything from ice cream to chocolates (I have quite a sweet tooth) and we bought some mouthwatering cakes which, after a long walk around the bay, were much needed."
,,Every designer brand you can imagine...,5.0,,This really is one of the most beautiful shopping malls we have ever seen anywhere. It's huge and contains every designer brand there is plus lots of other shops and restaurants.
,,Walk through to the hotel,3.0,,We walked through the shopping centre on the way to the marina bay sands. Very big centre. Comes with it's own river and gondolas.
,,Great location,5.0,,"Great shopping, dining and a sensation water show at dusk. Enjoy a meal and drink and watch the show, well worth it"
,,Exclusive shop mall,5.0,,"This mall is large and oppulant. If you enjoy browsing through high end stores all located next to one another, then this is the place for you. Needless to say, this is not a bargainhunters paradise. Zegna doesn't design bargains and Rolex don't give their watches away, but it is a great place for a look."
,,Good shopping experience,4.0,,Various choices! Good service! Nice arrangement of shopes. You can find luxury brands here and common brands here. Food court is good.
,,Interesting for a Look but Expensive & What you Find everywhere else!,3.0,,"The shopping centre is a nice design, but a little impractical. It was nice looking around and seeing the canal and things like that but the actual restaurants and stores were over priced and was very crowded most of the time. In Asia when you are in an area with cheap food and shopping, I dont see much point in shopping in an area thats western prices or more, that is also more crowded than your home country aswell. These kinds of malls are everywhere in the world and throughout Asia, with the same designer chain stores you get in western countries and similar prices. whilst this one is quite impressive it is very touristy and not the kind of place a normal person would go shopping but definately worth the trip for a look around if you're in the area. One thing worth noting is the subway whilst close to this center it was very frustrating having to wait so long to buy a ticket, was quite unimpressed with Singapores transport system, its only good if you have a prepaid card but annoying if you have to buy a ticket each time."
,,Expensive shops,4.0,,Good quality shopping mall. Very impressive. Prices were not on display in most of the shops but obviously very expensive.
,,"Not a shopper, but enjoyed walking through",4.0,,Why does a non-shopper go here? Because the Marina Bay Sands area is large and multi-use and hooks to the subway. Nice architecture and plenty of high-end shops and interesting eateries.
,,Impressive mall at the bay,4.0,,"at the moment you arrive at The Shoppes of Marina Bay, you know it was a luxury mall. Well even if you don't buy anything, you still can go window shopping. They have different atmosphere, they has venice-like small river with Gondola.
You can go there by MRT.
If you hungry, you can eat at food center, the price is the same as you can find in any other mall."
,,An attraction of its own,4.0,,"This shopping complex can be considered an attraction of its own, filled with people, local and tourist. It has a Venice-like with gondola rides on the man-made canals. If you are not interested with luxury shopping, just walk around and check out the Rain Oculus above the shopping mall canal.

Lots of food choices at the Rasapura and extensive list of restaurants in this mall."
,,Impressive mall,4.0,,"Even if you are not a buyer you have to come here. The building is huge and the design is different. Its one of those places where the designer or owner is just saying ""look what we can build"". It has a lot of high end shops such as Gucci, LV and Ferragamo. It even has a standalone Ferrari store. There are lots of restaurants inside for all price points. Its a little far from Orchard but its worth the trip. When you go there schedule a lunch or dinner at least with the trip to make the trip worthwhile"
,,It depends on the width of your wallet,4.0,,"More of a place to look at the kind of places the other half shops this bright and airy shopping complex is a great way of getting out of the Singapore heat and humidity while spending some time ogling things that don't necessarily have price tags because hey, if you have to ask how much it is you can't afford it!

Having said that for all its vacuous and ostentation displays of wealth this isn't truly on the nose, it functions as a thoroughfare to get over to Marina Bay Sands and its Observation Deck if nothing else."
,,"Best way to discover the luxuries of shopping, dining and entertainment",5.0,,"Best way to discover the luxuries of shopping is to go to this place. It is Singapore’s largest luxury shopping malls with a unmatched mix of top international brands, emerging labels and new concepts. Located in the heart of the Central Business District, connected to Gardens by the Bays by a walking distance bridge, this eye-catching shopping destination features a contemporary and open design, offering breathtaking views of the Marina Bay skyline. Enjoy the Light & Sound Show outside this in the evening. You can go to the top of Marina Bay Sands, 57th floor, to have 360 degree view of the city. Go to http://www.marinabaysands.com to see details for shopping, entertainment, dining, museum, SPA etc. Natural sunlight illuminates the interiors of the mall via full-glass windows. Go to the lower floor for a wide range and choices of food. Other innovative concepts here include Singapore’s first skating rink within a mall, as well as a canal where you can take a relaxing boat ride through the retail belt."
,,nice LONG walk!,5.0,,highend retailers as expected but I was impressed by the amount of sunlight we could enjoy while staying indoors - a wonderful place for shopahollic mothers with tots or kids
,,Visit the observation deck,4.0,,"Huge malls with very good restaurant and brand tenant inside. Must visit is the TWG in the center for their sorbet. It has a man-made canla in the middle of the mall and you can board a little sampan for some fee and take a cruise in the mall.
Go up to the top floor by the elevator and head out to the observation deck for a view of singapore. This mall also connected with the bridge toward Garden by the bay. Just walk until the end of the long observation deck."
,,high end shoppping at its best,5.0,,loved the variety of high end shops and the restaurants by celebrity chefs. theres also a skating rink in the mall which is awesome.
,,High end shopping place,4.0,,"I make appointment here to meet my sister and it takes 30 minutes for us to meet each other. It's a high end shopping mall with all the branded names. Anyway, if you want to spend time here, you can walk around and after that in evening enjoy a laser show from the outdoor of this place. FREE !"
,,An enjoyable walk,4.0,,"We stayed at the Ritz Carlton, which is a short walk to the shopping center and walked over in the late morning before it got hot. The Mall was an enjoyable visit but we found the prices to be much more than we expect to pay in the US. The mall does have a lot of food options and we found this to be enjoyable. It is a good place to walk through various shops in the Air Conditioned environment and an enjoyable excursion."
,,Nice mall but a Bit pricey!,4.0,,"Nice mall in a nice location, but a bit pricey for my liking - it did not however stop the Wife from shopping here!!"
,,The best mall I`ve been to,5.0,,"Connected to Marina bay sands hotel, a huge space for shopping, eating and entertainment.You can spend hours walking and shopping.There are almost all welknown brands, cafe and restaurants and even an ice-skating rink.Rasapura is another place of interest there, you can find different cuisines in one place.Everything you buy here (except food and drinks) is refundable."
,,It was a nice place,4.0,,My daughter super love the place (just like the grand canal shops and gondola rides in Macau). We will definitely return here.
,,Great in every thing,4.0,,The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands so nice with its shops The narrow stream with the sailing ride unforgettable i like every thing there coming back next visit in my plans i strongly recommended the The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands to my friends
,,impressive,3.0,,"Very busy, very modern. Great place for shopaholics. Even if you are not one, its an interesting place to visit.
The Louis Vuitton outlet is impressive. You enter on the ground floor which is akin to an art gallery. There are artworks and sculptures for you to admire.
Take the escalator to the 1st floor and the hallowed atmosphere changes to a noisy marketplace. Business is great, especially from tourists from China."
,,WONDERFUL,5.0,,"If you have a big wallet ,go shopping there, you can find a 300.000 dollars watch or 1.000 Dollars Louis Vuitton wallet , similar to Dubai shopping center,I really recommend ."
,,If you like to splurge,5.0,,"This is the mall to go if you wish to gamble and spend. The stores here are all high end and not for the budget traveller. However, they are located in one of the most scenic and iconic view of Singapore. Garden By the Bay is located right next to it and also if you walk along the malls there are waterfront for you to just catch the evening sun and see the sea and skyline light up for the night."
,,Bring plenty of money. And then some more!,3.0,,"Having stayed at MBS, we walked through the shopping complex numerous times. There were many interesting things to see, and a good deal of variety, but I was put off by what I considered very high prices. There were only a few shops that we were prepared to purchase anything from.

We also didn't have much success in the way of dining.

It's worth noting that the shopping complex has a skating rink, a kids play facility (expensive) and entrance to the casino."
,,Good for a look,3.0,,This mall is like many attached to big hotels and casinos. It has a lot of high end shops with prices that are very high. If you want to buy brand labels there are better places in Singapore. There are a lot of food places and some of them are quite good and others ordinary. Remember to eat where there is a queue of locals.
,,Luxury Mall,5.0,,"This one is worth of visit, even though you don't have wallet with you. Amazing location, near many major attractions. Inside you can find everything from gondola ride to ice rink and of course loads of upper scale boutiques"
,,Amazing Mall with all Premium Brands,5.0,,"This is an amazing and must visit mall in Singapore, All the premium brands are here, you can shop till you drop. There is an Indian food counter at the food court, kindly have your food before 10pm. They close down by 10:15pm. There is Punjab Grill Restaurant too but is quite expensive."
,,Glorified Shopping Mall swarming with gamblers.,2.0,,"Not particularly impressed with this Mall. Been here twice, in 2011 and 2013. Mostly high-end goods sold here (you can get the same stuff in practically any country on earth). Eerily quiet when there's not many people around, but during peak hours, you'd want to leave the place a.s.a.p. So many gamblers come here to burn off their winnings. Locals come here just to make use of the air-conditioning system. Large tour groups with unruly children visit this place.

The only thing worth going to is TWG's two main outlets. They serve splendid tea and ice-cream."
,,Great Shopping,5.0,,"Loved coming to Marina Bay Sands-- the shops were nice. Some stores haven't opened yet, still under construction. A must do in Singapore. BUT the shops on Orchard Road are the same and have better choices, just fyi. Enjoy!"
,,Fantastic shopping,5.0,,Great shopping area with some shops that are very hard to find elsewhere Mostly all designer stuff so not cheap Many great looking restaurants too but didn't try I recommend risks shop for high end gold plated ornaments and Ferrari shop
,,Did not like this at all,1.0,,"This is one of the worst malls that I have ever been to. It is not only overpriced relative to other malls even in Singapore, which is traditionally more expensive than Europe/US, but many shops have not yet opened when I was there so it was a walk past many 'coming soon' billboards.

The luxury shops there have really limited stock and are catering for people who win money and want to spend it impulsively on a whim buying something they don't need. I guess this is what many casino shops are like, but this is especially true for The Shoppes.

The high street shops also have very limited ranges and are not very exciting in their presentation or layouts.

The mall lay out itself is very confusing as it doesn't really have proper sections (e.g. high street/luxury/toys/electronics etc.) like good malls in other cities, especially when compared to Hong Kong's Landmark/Causeway Bay/Admiralty. This means you often end up walking past the same place many times and can miss a section entirely because you don't turn off into the right part of the mall. The cosmetic shops are also very annoying trying to offer 'free' samples to anyone that walks past.

The canal is really boring - there is a boat that goes past the shops on the lower ground floor, where there is not much light. So it's not too different to an experience of standing on a flat escalator at Changi airport going past it's shops.

The Shoppes definitely not where locals would come to shop!"
,,"Very pretty, elegant mall with good stores",4.0,,"This is a great mall. The insides are spacious, new and elegant. The selection of stores are very good. A lot of high end shops as well as international brands. I didn't cover the entire mall as it is just too big but there is alsp an ice rink."
,,Excellent breakfast as the food court,4.0,,"When staying at the Marina Sands Hotel, you can either have breakfast as their expensive busy buffet, or take a walk to the Shoppes food court, where most of the stalls open early. If you go at 9:30am, there is an excellent ""Sarawak"" style dry noodles with barbequed pork which is heaven on a plate. I like this with a Teh Tarik (tea with condensed milk) and perhaps a slice of toasted kaya from the nearby coffee stall. Doesn't get any better than this for a great start to the day, away from the boring usual hotel bacon and eggs."
,,Beautiful Mall,4.0,,"Shopping here is truly only for the rich, however it is a very beautiful Mall to stroll through and there are some great restaurants here. While walking by the Marina Bay it's a get place to duck into for some cooling off time or to get out of an afternoon shower. You'll find a store for just about everything including sports cars."
,,Good food court,3.0,,High priced luxury items in the mall. Food is good with a massive range of asian stalls to choose from.
,,Great place to shop and dine,4.0,,"Visited this place with my two teenaged daughters. As always this place is a heaven for them to shop and Dine. Pizza Mozza is a fabolous place to eat. Shops are great too, with many well known brand. Dont need to go to other malls too. Food court was good and extensive too.. Nice place to go in singapore. Highly commendable."
,,"Nice, well designed mall but lacking ATM's!",4.0,,"We visited the Shoppes and enjoyed the couple of hours we spent wondering around. The mall is very tastefully designed and spacious. Also a nice relief from the hot and humid conditions outside!
Plenty of designer brands here for those inclined to do some expensive shopping.
The mall has plenty of entertainment options as well as a great hawker style food court located at the far end.
The only major frustration we had was getting cash - I understand many trade with cards rather than cash these days however the hawker stalls only accept cash. Once we worked this out we went on a search for a machine only to be told they were at the other end of the mall - literally a 15 min walk away. At this point we missed out on lunch and they missed out on a sale. If the mall offers services which don't accept card payment, it's crazy not to allow ATM's at resonable intervals so people can actually spend their money. Outside of this, quite a nice place."
,,Extensive,4.0,,"An extensive, easily accessible shopping centre, however unless you like extremely premium (read: expensive) brand shopping, there's not much to do except browse, enjoy the sights (including the indoor canal with gondolas) and try the food hall for local cuisine."
,,HK Roast at The Shoppes is a rip off.,1.0,,"Our stay at MBS for new years eve was awesome. After beautiful dinners at Ku De Ta, Bay sushi, room service and every where else I ate in Singapore the only time I felt ripped off on the whole holiday so far was half an hour ago when I ordered suckling pig combo from HK roast at the food court in The Shoppes. $18.30 for less than 100g of fat and sauce. Not 1 piece of meat. I must have looked like a sucker. I didnt notice how pathetic it was until I got back to my room."
,,Super exclusive,5.0,,"Who doesn't know this shopping complex after a huge marketing campaign thrown in at newspapers and magazines? We enter from the ground level and immediately mesmerized by the super exclusive branded shops line up. But if you go down to the basement level, there are many shops that are more familiar at malls. Its a little bit dark in the mall I must say, perhaps thats the way a luxury mall should be."
,,Another Mall,3.0,,"We came on a Sunday intent on going to the top. However, to eat there, they wanted S$98
per person for brunch. Or just to visit, it cost S$20 p.p. to go on top, so we passed.
The Mall itself is like any other upscale mall anywhere in the world. The food court was good,
even though completely jam-packed. We had to walk around 15 minutes just to get 2 seats.
Food was pretty good, nonetheless. Also, try the good Gelato store one floor up."
,,Shop and dine....,5.0,,"Would always drop by to shop and dine when I'm here in Singapore. It's cool, comfortable and spacious. The exterior and interior views are just magnificent. Shopped at Gucci and Louis Vuitton the last time, staffs here are well trained and courteous. Enjoyed my lunch at Pizzeria Mozza too. Make no mistake, the shopping experience here is for those who look for designer brands and higher end labels. But even if you aren't into shopping, come here for the views or just to hangout. It's worth it."
,,Expensive and could be anywhere in the world,3.0,,"If expensive shops are your thing, then maybe this will be for you. My 6 year old like the Sampan ride, and the water-fall was pretty cool. I personally found it all very over-priced and ho hum. Apart from the delicious breakfast laksa at Toastbox :)"
,,a formula one race car and a great food court - what more do you want? :),4.0,,"It has every high end shop you could want! I almost couldn't afford a look :)
but that being said it is a lovely mall and the meer size of it is flabergasting! you can take a gondola trip within the mall - doesn't that say it all?! :)

the best thing for me was the food court! just as cheap as the rest of the city and just as good!"
,,Fabulous Shopping Center,5.0,,"This is probably the largest shopping center in the world. I have never seen more high class stores in one place. Lots of places to eat. If you plan to shop, better bring plenty of cash, but it cost nothing to wander around. I think that it is a great tourist destination for the place is out of the future."
,,not affordable for budget traveller,4.0,,"loved to stroll and window-shop along the complex, but the price and the brands are way above my budget, so just pass by :p"
,,so convenient,5.0,,"Came here during one of my stopover in SIN. Easy to reach via train. able to buy what I needed and head back to Changi with ample time to claim GST and check into my flight.
This place is huge. Look at the map and head straight to what you are looking for then head out."
,,A stunning shopping experience,4.0,,"From outside it is one of the wonder of the modern world and THE Postcard of Singapore.
From inside it is a unique shopping experience. The right mix of luxury and affordable goods and food. Big but not too much, cultural just enough. The most attractive place in Singapore after Orchard Road"
,,Great shopping but wear comfy shoes,3.0,,"Great shopping but exhausting. The entire complex is designed so that you need to walk to the end to go up or down each level, I suspect this is to 'force' you to look at each store. Personally I found this annoying and increasingly frustrating as used to better designed complexes in Australia. I'm happy to shop all day but for the love of god give me escalators that go each way on each level or a lift - don't know how anyone elderly or with disability gets around this complex. Shops were good though standard mix of high end designer with a few mind to high street chains thrown in. Against Aussie dollar many items were cheaper than home but high end designer was more expensive. Overall a nice place to shop but exhausting due to design of complex."
,,not a creature was stirring....,1.0,,"it's comfortable and cool, has a great food court if your happy to walk a mile. it's so very over priced you will be sure to have the place to yourself."
,,Absolutely brilliant,4.0,,Brilliant shopping in a very modern shopping centre. Dont expect too many bargains but this place is worth a couple of hours of your time!
,,World class building and fantastic shopping area,5.0,,The shopping mall is world class and the layout utilizing the nature light is amazingly pleasing to stroll along even though I'm not keen on shopping. You can go out towards the LV shopping and there is an lookout area that you can see the outline of the 'original' shoreline as the land is reclaimed. The stores are mostly or all upscale type. There is a very food court that is filled with variety of food and drink.
,,Plan a visit here as part of a day trip to Marina Bay- access by MRT (Bayfront)- Las Vegas style shops and restaurants,4.0,,"The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands are reminiscent of the shopping malls in the upmarket Las Vegas casinos.

There is a wide range of famous label and prestige brand shops, so it is a good place for window shopping.

Also, there are many eating opportunities, including several celebrity restaurants (once again, like Las Vegas).

And, there's an indoor ice rink!

This is a good place to visit as part of a day trip to Marina Bay- besides here, you can visit the Gardens by the Bay and the ArtScience Museum.

Well worth a visit."
,,shopping at its best,5.0,,"Wherever you go in Singapore, you will always be amazed at how clean and high tech everything is. The Marina Bay shops are no exception. From coffee shops to ice skating rink, its an awsome place. And to top it off, there is also a gondola ride, in the middle of the centre. So cool!"
,,singapore sounds and lights at marina bay,5.0,,"in the shoppes at marina bay, it is near the singapore river cruise where you can see the different buildings in singapore. it is better to go there at night to enjoy the two shows of singapore lights and sounds at the events plaza at 8:00 pm and 9:30 pm. it is really amazing and it is free of charge"
,,Marina bay,5.0,,"Easy access via MRT. Luxurious hotel, shopping centre and provides good services. At night they have shows. Good views and interesting activities to be done. Such as shopping, ice skating, ride the boat inside, enjoy the scenery of the bay from the outside."
,,Great food court next to ice rink,4.0,,"Nice shopping experience, even if just to stroll through. Ate some great food in food court next to ice skating rink."
,,Visit from Australia,5.0,,"We always enjoy Singapore. A visit to the Marina Bay is an enjoyable day out. So much to take in. Each year you go back always something different. This year they are re doing the water canal at the shopping centre. Casino always worth a visit. Take your passport ,to show as you enter. Singapore is not a cheap holiday anymore, but always new buildings taking place. The top of Marina Bay is well worth a visit. Yes a little pricy, but a great view. Noticed this year some new shops happening. Not my kind of shopping, too expensive for me, but always enjoy looking."
,,Great shopping mall..,4.0,,"This mall is great and quite different with the other..

We take sampan ride SGD 10 each person. Even toddler >= 2 years old also must pay.. But it is ok.. The staff is quite friendly also.. Photographer is not very skilled but quite friendly..

Other than that there are huge variety of nice food available..
Normally we go to Rasapura food court.. Got nice dim sum with reasonable price..

Other than that got some restaurant like Todai (all you can eat) that we ever try.. Best if you are really hungry and the price not really expensive but also not too cheap.."
,,Great shopping,5.0,,"By the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Have your photo taken with a formula 1 car through the big plate glass window, plenty of shops both designer and not so designer, coffee shops, cafe's and resturaunts"
,,Heaven,5.0,,We visited Marina Bay Sands The shoppes on our 2nd stay in Singapore.This place is heaven for shopping. We love it. Easy to access from the MRT or by bus. It is a must visit to Singapore as you can see Merlion and Esplanade outside. It is one of the best shopping mall in Singapore.
,,Shopper's wet dreams are come true,4.0,,"Go in there and cool down. You will find several good restaurants hand some not so good). This is a must see place in Singapore. Not the most interesting architecture, a bit too big for me."
,,"Take loads of money. Boutique shops like Chanel, Burberry ect.",5.0,,"Casino Is so big and modern. Loved our evening at Mariner Sands, dinner looked down on the gondola a great light show. Make sure you take a trip just for the light show on the water. It is free."
,,Great shopping experience,5.0,,It is such a great shopping mall. I enjoyed the laser light show out side the mall. It was such a great experience for me. Really liked the experience of laser show. It is a great place to get yourself entertained.
,,Expensive Brands,4.0,,"Most of the shops here are Fendi, Chanel, Gucci etc etc. The shopping complex is huge with lots of glitter and pizzaz. If you are a High End Brand purchaser then this is definitely the place for you. The complex is relatively new and indoors. Level B2 of the Shoppes has the Rasapura food court with a skating rink in the middle. Here you will find Western and Asian inspired food outlets all reasonably priced all offer quick service and value. We had to wait for a table as it was quite busy. This complex is linked to. Marina Bay Sands hotel and close to the city."
,,Wow,5.0,,Wow what an experience....very expensive though just a pleasure to wonder around. Some good food options also. The shopping will suit those with an unlimited budget.
,,Big and Modern,4.0,,"Marina Bay Shopping Complex is a huge and very modern complex. Get on your most comfortable fashion shoes and break out the credit cards, you will need them.
Take a camera also. The OTT opulence is quite breathtaking. can't imagine how they afford the rent.
Cant say too much , but it is a shoppers paradise."
,,Various Choice's Restaraunts.,4.0,,"After visiting Singapore Flyer or Gardens by Bay make you way down to Canal level B2 of the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands (near Skating rink) to find Rasapura food court where you will find Western and Asian inspired food outlets all reasonably priced all offer quick service, value, and there's plenty of seating."
,,More expensive shops!,3.0,,Just another shopping centre with high end expensive shops. The gondola ride looked boring. The skate rink with everyone watching you from the food court didn't look much fun. Did like the food court which had a large range of different food at reasonable prices. Easy to get the MRT from there as it joins the shops. We walked to MBS shoppes from the Gardens on the Bay across the Dragon Fly Bridge.
,,"High end shopping, terrible food court!",3.0,,"Shopping therapy is excellent, place was very nice and posh. The casino was nice but there wasn't any dress code! One can go with a round neck tee, shorts and flip flops! Gosh! It just so meant, ""I only want your $!""
The food court was terrible, insufficient tables and literally you have to stand and ""pressure"" the seated to quickly finish up and go so that you'll have a place to sit and dine. If you can avoid, don't eat at the food court."
,,Sheer luxury for the window shopper,5.0,,"We always spend a few hours wandering around the shopping section od Marina Bay, studiously avoiding the casino entrance! Plenty of brand names, heaps of choice, and we particularly like theFood Court which caters for the thousands of locals who eat there daily. Every ethnic group is catered for and we always end up ay the yum cha shop wit its vast array of delights. Great place to watch the locals, not many tourists, as long as you can find a table."
,,Nice,5.0,,Part of the Marina Bay Sands precinct this HUGE air conditioned shopping centre provides an interesting (and cool) respite from the Singapore heat and humidity. Every designer brand you can think of (and more) so don't forget the credit card.
,,Lives up to the hype,5.0,,"Its easy to think people go a little overboard with Marina Bay, the mall, the hotel, you know, the lot. But having finally visited the place, it really is something else.

Where to start, the mall is stunning. No matter how many malls you have been to, there are a lot of touches here which will surprise you. It just seems to be a cut above other malls. You can take a boat ride, listen to a live string quartet, walk over to the symbol of opulence that is the LV store which is truly ridiculous (in a good way), gaze over the bay and then ride the escalators up and up till you go to the roof and then cut directly through the marina bay hotel and find yourself in the magnificent Gardens by the Bay. Yeah try doing all that at your average mall. I forgot, there is a casino and the mastercard theater as well.

We saw Jersey Boys at the theater and I am running out of superlatives but it was well worth the pricey tickets. We sat in some amazing seats and had a great time.

This is a mall, so there are shops but lets not kid ourselves, these are expensive stores. I didn't dare to visit one of the ultra specialty restaurants but rest assured you won't see this type of restaurant at your average mall either.

Long story short, if you are in Singapore you know you will be there."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"We went there on 2 evenings. Many very posh shops and restaurants but we only ate at the food courts. Rasapura on level B2 near the ice-skating rink was larger and had much more variety. A Taste Of Nanyang on B1 at the other end of the mall was relatively more expensive and less crowded - we were disappointed to find that many advertised dishes were unavailable and settled for Thai food; even then they got our orders wrong and the food was just so-so.

We combined the visits to the mall with a walk into the great and extremely long hotel lobby, the Artscience Museum and Gardens By The Bay - on one occasion, we took the bridge link which went over the motor expressway and on the other, we took the underpass which began at the end of the Helix bridge. We watched the free ""water & light"" show (at 8pm and 9.30pm) from our hotel on one side of the bay as well as from the front of the mall. With the beautifully lit Singapore skyline as a background, the water screens, music, sound effects, flames, bubbles and all, the 10 minute show was quite moving and spectacular."
,,The first mall I saw with a river and gondolas,5.0,,"Like I said in the title , this mall has river , bridge , gondolas , water drops from above like waterfall. And people throw their coins at the river. You can literally ride the gondola , but you have to pay. The foods are expensive (so do the stuffs). This is a high end mall."
,,Shoppers Paradise,4.0,,"along with some culture, if you carry on across the courtyard to the Art/Science Museum. The shops are all up market stores and hardly anyone in them when we visited. It's pleasant to walk around and the mock gondolas plying the short man made river along with the waterfall, are well worth a photo. There are plenty of cafes, a food court and more up market eateries to choose from. There is a skating rink and it's wonderfully air conditioned."
,,Shoppers Paradise,5.0,,"Bring your money with you but even if you don't buy anything, it is well worth a visit. Go to the top floor of Marina Bay Sands Hotel for the stunning views."
,,great place,5.0,,"went shopping here with my friends, tried their food court and was also good, I was amazed by the shops in this mall, I could stay here for a whole day wandering around."
,,Cool haven,5.0,,On hot days it´s nice to get to this cool place and make your visa-card glow instead. Cheap shops and the very opposite right next to each other. The place to find what your searching for.
,,Fantastic Surrealistic Epicurean Epic experience reminiscence of Sci-Fi Movie Set,5.0,,"The gigantic double storey full frontage rows of luxury stores beats that of Macau Sands Shoppes hands down, with gondola rides down below and TWG tea swanky boutique, the Shoppes was executed every bit for the High heeled women of the millennium. It is an Epicurean wet dream for SuperModels. The long walkways serves as a fashion runway for all model wannabes wishing to be seen.

For Paiza Casino types, F&B outlets all High end abound with Guy savoy charging 500 sgd per pax along with other types like Waku Ghin.

For the average TomDicks, there's always the Double frontage Chanel / Guess /Ferrari Porche design stores to be seen in.

For only the invited, the LV flagship store is just outside. If you're a librarian type that prefer Musum touring, There's an Arts Science museum. If you still prefer Starbucks, there's always coffee outlets and High end food court Rasapura msatersthat serves up loca delicacies like Claypot laksa at 15sgd per plate. And yes and earn Sands Casino reward points while doing it."
,,High End Stores,3.0,,"I believe there are 3 or 4 floors of shops and areas to eat. Chic, expensive and massive. All luxury designer name brands. Great place if you are into that and can afford it."
,,good shopping place.,5.0,,a little expensive but good stuff. A gondola ride is very nice in the shopping area. Food court in the shopping mall is also good and lot of choice for all .You can watch laser show after shopping in the evening.
,,Breathtaking architecture,4.0,,Breathtaking architecture. Chic amenities. Cool restaurants. Perfect for tourists wanting to experience a high-class tour in singapore
,,Its nice,3.0,,"Very posh stores expected for those staying at MBS, but the hotel is one thing and the shoppes nearby is another story. Filled with high end brands I ended up walking past and admiring the products but knew it wasn't something id afford, in this lifetime. very expensive everywhere"
,,Very big,4.0,,If you like the top end shops then this is the stop for you. All the big names all within walking distance in a nice fully AC building. Don't miss the water show if you happen to be there at night.
,,Fantastic shopping center,4.0,,"Expensive designer label shopping. The multi-level mall includes good views over the city, and a gondola lake. Also access to the roof of Marina Bay Sands hotel $20pp."
,,Huge Mall thats indoors,4.0,,Huge mall that connects to the hotel/casino. Great to have quick access to on those humid 100 degree days. Tons of restaurants that are reasonably priced and tons of shops that are overpriced. I found also that the mall though had only a few elevators so bringing the baby carriage was more time consuming since you had to go to middle of mall to get up the floors.
,,Singapore another must visit tourist spot!,4.0,,"I love for being here, inside-in. Lots of things you can do here, from sight seeing the people who play in the casino to enjoy romantic and calming atmosphere outdoor in the afternoon.
For branded shoppers, here is one of the best places among others such as Orchard are and Vivo mall in Singapore. Then place is neat, tidy, and so comforting.

My favorite spot is eating in the food court or by eating at small bistro while seating next to mall-made VENICE river/canal and watching traditional boat crossing by.
Can spend days there and drinking coffee with your pals."
,,High end shopping,5.0,,"Wow, what a lavish shopping centre! All of the big brands are here, Gucci, Prada, etc. The food hall is amazing. Gardens by the Bay is right next door. To get there, catch the red North South SMRT line to NS27 Marine Bay, then transfer to the orange Circle line at CC1 and get off at Bayfront CC2."
,,most lavish mall in asia,5.0,,"indeed this is a world class. i am a traveler and a self-confessed shopper. i love going to places and always consider their shopping area. my last day in Singapore is for Marina Bay Sands. The Shoppes is truly an attraction for a shopper like me. my heart was tachycardic when i arrived. i am in heaven! yes i know a bit overreacting, but hey you'll wont see a place like this in southeast asia! see it to your self and if you want to experience tachycardia (medical term: hear rate of 100 & above beats per minute). enjoy your shopping!"
,,Excellent but Expensive!!!!,5.0,,Excellent place to be and hang out and look around but i think this is the most expensive shopping mall in Singapore!!!
,,Excellent shopping,5.0,,The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands is the premiere luxury shopping in Singapore. All the luzury brand shops. Foodcourt is also excellent and cheap so don't have to eat at fancy restaurants there.
,,do not need to go to Orchard road,5.0,,many shops and the many to come in the next weeks better then Orchard road which is more crowded if you stay at the marina this is a great place to shop and many nice restaurants to go to
,,A shoppers' paradise,4.0,,"Well worth a visit & unlike any modern shopping precinct we have ever seen overseas. Towering glass walls & ceilings, retail outlets to suit all manner of budgets & within walking distance to the Singapore Flyer. Catching the MTR meant changing lines for the final few stops on what we saw as a spur line was more of a nuisance & one wonders why a direct line was not planned for such a popular destination."
,,Beautiful upscale mall on a grand scale,4.0,,"This has many luxury brands and high end shops, as well as being home to restaurants like Cut. A very long mall that is immaculately laid out and a pleasure to walk through. Many of the luxury brand outlets are effectively just showrooms to showcase the brand. Worth a visit."
,,This complex is huge,4.0,,Good place to visit and get to the Gardens by the Bay. Shopping expensive as they cater to guests of the hotel which is seriously expensive.
,,Air conditioning while you shop,4.0,,"Marina Bay was full of something for everyone; eateries, shops, skate rink. Lots of shops selling luxury goods well over my price range but you are as welcome as the affluent. From Louis Vuitton to 7/11 (like the Co-Op) there is something for everyone."
,,Super,5.0,,Well worth a visit. The shops etc.. are amazing. There is something for everyone. Food court a must!!
,,Le shopping experience,4.0,,"I love the shoppes here... so organized and lots to do... love the water line running through the mall giving a tranquil ambience. Lots of upmarket but there are also lots of middle range shops carrying the latest goods at sale price!
You can also go for a show at the theatre if you like...love the atmosphere"
,,Amazing Marina Bay Shopping Complex,4.0,,"This place is awesome ! We loved every moment in this Shopping Mall, everything for everybody , from exhibitions ,world designer brand, restaurants, food court, and the stunning look alike Venice waterway that you can hop a ride with Gondola.I tried the Marina Bay Sands Casino ,and did well.Its a huge complex ,easy to get lost , prepare your feet and wallets !"
,,Nice (and expensive) shops with good restaurant,5.0,,"Many shops (some are opening in the next months, many luxury good shops (first floating Louis Vuitton shop, many jewelleries..). Good restaurants, expensive for Singapore standards, but worthy. The dumplings restaurant is faboulous and quite cheap."
,,Shoping,4.0,,Marina bay is a nice place for a walk but its especially great for shopping and a lunch. The architecture is spectacular too.
,,Very expensive - but lovely to dream!,4.0,,Contain very expensive boutiques but its a lovely (and cool) place to hang out. Very pretty. Underground waterway with boats.
,,Lovely relaxing place,5.0,,Great place to go for a walk as you can do as little or as much as you like. If you are just after a stroll the surroundings are very pleasant and relaxing. If you want to enjoy the experience of shopping then the Marina Bay Mall is a great experience.
,,My favourite building!,5.0,,"Love this incredibly looking building! It's just amazing, heaps of expensive hi end shops (not good for me) several restaurants to,choose from, a great sense of space inside and a very good experience overall. You must visit this attraction if I'm Singapore."
,,Marina Bay,5.0,,"Lovely to walk around, do some shopping, eat, drink, relax. Allow half a day.....some top end stores at this end of town!"
,,Wow so many shops,5.0,,Loved this place it has all the name brands. Had some good sale items in some shops. It is amazing place even just to walk around to see the range of shops. You can get there by taxi or on the MRT.
,,Great mall,4.0,,"the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands is located at BayFront MRT Station (Circle Line), it's a part of Marina Bay Sands Casino and Hotel.
there are so many branded stores and restaurants. it's expensive to shop there, but it's good to hangout with friends there (especially for the tourists)"
,,"Gee, it's big.",4.0,,"For those who like exclusive (read incredibly expensive) shopping and really big, modern malls, this is the place to come (possibly even more so than Orchard Rd. though it's a close-run call).
Also,great for people watching if you like watching middle- aged Australians, particularly, walk around in design label shirts.
Will hold a place in our memory for a cafe selling us two cups of- admittedly good- coffee for over 17 Singaporean dollars.
This is almost certainly the most expensive cafe-served coffee we have ever drunk."
,,Fun for shoppers and non shoppers,5.0,,"Shopping, eating, walking... it is all good in this mall, i spent an afternoon there and it was fun, even though i did not buy alot of things, but walking around and eating in the food court was really nice, i also went to a spa that offers fish foot massage, it really tickles!!!"
,,"Band Stores, Amazing Food Court, Nice Resturants",5.0,,"This is perhaps one of the most touristy places in all of Singapore! The mall has several Brand shops, the food court is perhaps one of the best in town with Indian, Malay, Indonesian, Chinese and Korean food, just like any other food court in Singapore but a little more classy! The food court can get extremely crowded especially during the weekends at Dinner time. There are also a bunch of celebrity restaurants in the mall. There is an MRT connection to the mall so getting there is not a problem."
,,High End Shopping Mall,4.0,,"First of all, its quite big.The interior design is quite nice, you can watch singapore's skyscraper from here.Most of the shop is high end shopping, giving it location near marina bay, what do you expect.For Manchester United's fan, there is a Manchester United store in here.We went here for Zara boutique however the shop was closed due to renovation.The food court is kinda big, and you have a lots of option for food.Love the indoor pool."
,,"A most spectacular shopping complex, just expensive...",5.0,,"This centre is definitely worth a visit. From boats paddling around on the ground level to an ice skating rink, there is plenty to amaze and impress you! The bottom level will offer food at reasonable prices or expensive eateries - your choice. Even if you don't spend any money here the entertainment value and photo opportunities are hard to beat. And of course the airconditioning ;) ..."
,,Its ok,4.0,,"The place is quite big and a little messy,all stores are high-end so its actualy for the rich (its in marina bay so it should be for the rich),you will be needing atleast half day to finish all the shops. I personally enjoyed experiencing it but it doesnt actualy give you something special,its a shopping center so i can do my shopping in my country their are alot of places innsingapore that i would rather go :)"
,,What a spectacle! Impressive shopping experience,4.0,,Wow! This is one hell of a shopping joint. Dining is quite an event in the enormous food court. Shops and more shops. Did the Science Museum and loved it. Great photo place and loved the design aspects of the place.
,,Well Worth a Visit,5.0,,The Marina Bay Sands Shopping centre is well worth a visit. It may be a bit pricey for the average tourist but still well worth going there. Try and stay for the light show on the broadwalk at 8pm
,,Great attractions,5.0,,"We shopped at the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands and took a dinner at the Rasapura food court. Going back to our hotel that night suddenly we saw people gathered by the water podium, because it was not long that the Light and Water attraction was displayed. Spectacular !"
,,Boring,2.0,,"I visited Marina Bay area and specially Gardens which is a beautiful place. This shopping mall is near, just below Marina Bay hotel. Honestly I was very disappointed. For a long time I did not see that boring mall full of top brands offering totally same stuff all over te world. Shops were empty and compare to other places in Singapore even the mall was not overcrowded. Very snobbish place... But what a surprise in restroom where I found ""turkish toilet"" (squat toilet) which is the last thing I would expect there. I run fast away to the colourful Singapore."
,,"Cool mall, even for window-shopping",4.0,,"The prices in this mall were well beyond my budget, but it's neat just to walk around in. It has a canal that runs down some of it and you can watch the faux-Venician gondolas go around. There are some weird statues and artwork to gawk at and lots and lots of stores.

If you do have the money, there's everything all the way into very high-end merchandise here."
,,Beautiful new shoppes,5.0,,"Now all the high end brands have come to Marina Bay and this set of shops is beautiful with nice little eateries, water features and decor. Prices were not fantastic but the layout was. A short walk from the Fullerton where we stayed on a nice walkway/boardwalk. The amazing architecture of the casino and hotel sits on top of you with nice views back to the colonial district. A good place to come and be air conditioned while you wonder and shop."
,,The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands,5.0,,Beautiful place to go shopping or walking along the waterfront of Marina Bay. Here you can find mid to luxury brand name shops and upmarket fine dining and shopping. The area is big and elegant and very clean. A lot of places to eat at The Rasapura Masters food court.
,,Upscale shopping,4.0,,"Located inside The Marina Bay Sands. There just to many shops here to window shop or find things, There are many boutique shops, restaurants and a Ice skating ring. An upscale experience. The has a nice atmosphere and nicely positioned. And there is a LV boutique outside."
,,A place to see and visit in Singapore,4.0,,Most beautiful mall in Singapore with a great foodcourt. Gives a sense of singaporean culture and ambiance (but rich and expensive side)
,,Shiny and brand new!,4.0,,"Lovely experience to window shop. A variety of stores to fit each budget. If your keen on the big brands... They are all here. And if your a legitimate buyer, dress accordingly to avoid the 'pretty woman' moment! Ice rink, ballroom for shows, restaurants and indoor canal. There must be 1000 watch stores... ! Wear comfy shoes and get ready for some retail therapy. My partner was very appreciative of the seats in every store! Enjoy"
,,Floors of top end shops,5.0,,"The shops attached to the Marina Bay Sands are in a magnificent building and well worth the visit – many shops and eateries and the way to get to the Science Museum and the walkway around the Bay area. My wife and I spent hours of most days walking around in airconditioned comfort looking at the 3 floors of shops which are set out in from 3 to 5 what I would call arcades. The shops are part of the Exhibition Halls and the Theatre and are serviced by the MRT. All the 'Top End -Upmarket' shops are here, you are spoiled for choice and variety. You can have a boat ride down the canal which runs along one of the arcades and ends where a giant bowl in the roof is filled with water and every now and then sends a great casade down into the canal.
One shopping plaza not to be missed."
,,Yes!,5.0,,"Beautiful shopping centre, not for a budget minded person though! Loved the Louis Vuitton floating store."
,,Great place for luxury shopping & indulgent meals,4.0,,"Huge mall but recently organised with lots of signage around. Nice mix of high, mid and lower brow shopping and saves an additional trip, say if you need to get a nice formal outfit for a ball and everyday toiletries. I especially like the large selection of luxury brands available there.

In terms of F&B, I would only recommend Wolfgang Puck's CUT and Mario Batali's Osteria Mozza and Pizzeria Mozza. Service and food at all 3 establishments are first-rate and worth every penny! All other eateries in The Shoppes aren't worth spending on, especially the food court."
,,Very Upmarket,5.0,,"What amazed us the most of the Shoppes is the sheer variety . You have all the designers brands and prices that we cannot afford and yet they then have retail outlets that the average person can afford. It works extremely well. The same can be said for the variety in restaurants, as you have the upmarket fine dining as well as the food hall on the lower ground with food to die for and so cheap. There is a skating rink indoors as well as a waterway where you take a gondola ride all for a small fee. The gondola guy was so good with the kids as he was rocking the boat pretending that they would fall in. He even let boys boys ages 12 & 14 take a turn in paddling. What another great experience we had in SIngapore. I love love love SIngapore."
,,chic,4.0,,"the shopping experience even for a non shopper could be addictive here. inspite of the most premium brands, everyone could find things to buy. dont miss brands like charles and keith and mango which would offer much discounts. the place is happening. the food court is really good."
,,"Space, ambience and quality",5.0,,"High end shops abound in this incredible inside/outside air conditioned 'Plaza'. Everywhere we went we found staff friendly, knowledgeable, and very helpful. Plenty to see and buy!"
,,High end shopping mall,5.0,,"Beautiful place to go shopping or just browsing, there are plenty of high end and famous brands such as Louis Vuitton, Chanel to name a few. And when you get tired of shopping you just go outside and sit down on the bench where you can see the sea or bay view. Excellent"
,,Very nice shopping mall on the Marina Bay waterfront,4.0,,"The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands is a nicely designed shopping and dining complex that is very well situated next the MBS hotel and along the waterfront of Marina Bay. It makes up part of a great overall environment in this area of Singapore.

Here you can find the expected mid to luxury brand name shops, wide range of dining options and water-themed entertainment.

We like seeing the traditional sampoon boats that you can ride (SG$10 per person) through the mall canals. This reminds of the Sands Venetian properties in Vegas and Macau where you can ride gondolas. There is also an interesting waterfall-like structure that can be seen in the mall as well as an ice-skating rink.

You can dine at famous dim sum restaurant here called Din Tai Fung, have a casual meal at the Rasapura Masters food court, a nice afternoon tea seating at one of the TWG tea spots as well as a nier meal at one of the finer restaurants within this shopping mall.

You can also visit the ArtScience Museum, see one of the Sands theatre shows, or just walk outside to see the Water and Light show each evening at 8pm and 9.30pm before enjoying a walk along the very nice Waterfront Promenade.

Overall, some good shopping, dining and and a lot of activity in and around The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, making this a very good mall complex to target when visiting Singapore."
,,Very Stylish Mall,4.0,,"A big great mall, just next to the MBS hotel where you can mainly shop for luxury brands. The food court is small and offers a small variety of restaurant. You can ice skate inside depending on the period. The fountains and water games inside the mall are beautiful. Other than that, this is just a mall, and I wouldn't spend much time in it unless you really want to shop or have time available for window-shopping."
,,A feast for the eyes,4.0,,"I was awed by the attractive window displays of several high-end brands that i felt gratified to merely window shop at most of the stores. It was enjoyable to just walk around and be enthralled by the fancy display behind those windows, not knowing which item to pick since there were so many that seemed to rival my attention. Of course, one is also free to dream that one day i could shop till i drop with all my choices. That occasion will have to wait when time and money would already be at at my disposal! Their food court in the area of the skating rink proved to be a relaxing place to dine and unwind...it was a surprise that food proved to be reasonable in such a classy setting."
,,Indeed a High End Shopping Area,4.0,,"You'd be speechless upon stepping from the escalator just seeing the immense shopping area that is The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands. From Hermes, British India and much, much more . . . the place is big and elegant - all gleaming and sparklingly clean, new and kept.

Each of the store's display specially the row of jewelry ateliers all looks fabulous! It is indeed a must-see and you should allot a couple of hours just to be able to roam around and check out this place."
,,That's really wonderful,5.0,,"It would be easier and less stressful to write a book on the Mall at Marina Bay, is too restrictive enclose all this beauty in a review and maybe risk of omitting something.
What can I say, it's a fancy place, well maintained, efficient, in a unique environment in the world, everywhere you turn it's simply speechless.
Just in front of the Marina Bay Sands and the bay of Singapore as well as the superb skyline, this big Mall is spread over 2 floors, here are continuing at a repetition shops of well-known brands of Italian fashion maisons in the world.
In numerous restaurants and cafes, a bit 'of luxury and a touch of class given by the presence of a small canal crossed by some Venetian gondola boat.
Unique surroundings, for which I invite anyone to visit to get a unique experience of this beauty.
From here you also access into the casino and the sky deck of the Marina Bay."
,,Amazing shopping experience,4.0,,There are so many shops here you really don't know where to look first.A floating Louis Vuitton boutique ! An ice skating rink without ice! Beautiful tea shops for afternoon teas .
,,High end shoppers luxury,5.0,,"A must to visit and see how the other half live. An amazingly beautiful shopping mall within walking distance to the flower domes, casino and a lift up to the observation deck to view Singapore from the top of the ship. High tea at one of the amazing restaurants was Devine. Bring your passport because many purchases become duty free upon presentation of your passport."
,,Must see.,5.0,,"This place is amazing. Go towards the evening and catch the show out front, go to the museum, see the gardens, feed the casino, point is that this shopping is in the middle of it all. There is something interesting at every step of the way."
,,Amazing shops - very quiet,4.0,,Every designer store you could imagine - all expensive. Worth a look. Very quiet the day we were there - hardly any shoppers.
,,March 2013 visit to the Theatre & Mall,5.0,,"What's not to like unless you are anti shopping !. Enormous & impressive. Very busy in certain areas but not really oppressive - just mind boggling !. Theatre was great - we saw Le Noir with the Cirque de Soleil.... fantastic.
If you have not seen a high up view of Singapore - the Marina Bay Sands viewing platform is a must despite the cost etc."
,,huge shopping experience---again,3.0,,why did they put a boat on top of the building..get there and all it is is shops food court in basement overpriced and crowded the crowd in the know--know how to put their shopping bags on seats so it always looks full if you observe they never seem to move their shopping bags so you can sit down...unpleasant experiece ran to the light show after that disaster dinner choice
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Great place for shopping, you can shop till you drop or slowly walk through. Great restaurants were wonderful service, great selection. Sky-park is an awesome experience, the view is to die for. A pleasant experience."
,,Eat and shop away from the hot outdoors,4.0,,"It is an intresting mall with different brands.
It has a large food court with different tastes such as Japanese, Halal food, Indonisian, Malysian, Italian, Indian and fresh juices and fruits. Alot of restaurants and cafes also distributed all around the mall and same having an outdoor view to the bay.
The mall is a good place to waste your time in, it has many sights to visit like the Art Museum, Skypark, Helix bridge and taking a short ride in the Gandola in the indoor lake which will take you to an artificial waterfall with its breezing surroundings.
Also, do not miss the lighting fountain show at 7:45 pm and 9:30 pm.
Do not forget to have a tea time in TWG Tea cafe and buying some tea from its shop. TWG is a great experince."
,,Ice skating ring,5.0,,"This is not only a shopping centre The Shoppes also has an iceskating ring...hardly anyone skating there, canal with gondolas and a nice water fountian. I do not visit often but it's a pleasure when in the area or visiting other sights nearby."
,,"Big, good food court",4.0,,"Check out the food court in this giant, designer, expensive mall Tons of choices, great prices an high quality Lots of food courts in Singapore, but this one is 1 big vendor with tons of choices. Good chicken rice"
,,Shopping and water,3.0,,"High end shoppers shouldn't miss this place. If you're not a shopper it's still worth a look. We had a pleasant coffee by the main fountain and visited the IT show on there at the time. While there, wander across to the Gardens by the Bay."
,,Very expensive,3.0,,"Amazing complex for it's architecture, but shopping wise, out of most people's budget. Great idea with the gondola ride in the middle & skating rink. Good food court with some interesting dishes to try. Great walk"
,,Excellent Facilities,5.0,,"The broad spectrum of choice which are in a cool, clean & underground.The newly developed gardens are a MUST see even if you are not a gardener. These shopping areas have a direct access to all transport facilities bus, train & taxis. It is very...More"

,,Fabulous shops,5.0,,"If you are looking for bargains, don't look here. It's certainly the place for the most expensive man-made goods one could ever want. Big name brands are all here. The LV house is indeed spectacular. Restaurants of famous chefs are also here. We tried one...More"
,,Well located nicely build..,4.0,,"The shopping center is nice and big. you will see all the nice and expensive brands here.. like channel, Prada, Louis Vuitton, Bally, Guess, Armani etc. Nice place to spend time and have food at. shopping here is very expensive."
,,Interesting new shopping mall,5.0,,A lot of upmarket shops and well worth a visit. Wide choice of food in the food hall. Also liked the helix footbridge across the river.
,,We explored but couldn't afford!,4.0,,We needed a second mortgage to buy here but it was great to window shop. The structural architecture of the place was something to behold.
,,Very nice but very expensive,2.0,,"If you are looking for affordable shopping, I would steer clear of here. Whilst the shopping centre itself is nice, it consists of mainly Chanel, Prada, Louis Vuitton type expensive stores. There is one small section of more affordable shops but even thosr arent cheap....More"
,,Amazing Mall,5.0,,"The Louis Vuitton is jaw dropping.. even just for a window shop! There is a gondola ride, ice skating rink, loads of fabulous places to eat.. This is a beautiful mall to cruise through, have a meal and grab a coffee. Kept me smiling."
,,Good shopping and tour stop,5.0,,Original Singapore Hop On Hop Off and the Duck tour stops at Marina Bay. Spent a couple of hours shopping in the mall and had lunch in the basement food court.
,,Shop till you drop... if you can afford it.,3.0,,"Beautifull shopping mall, great design.

If you need a nice cell phone go to Vertu, a nice watch go to Fanck Muller, Cartier.

A nice dress... then you go to Tiffany &co or Chanel.

All nice but only nice to go ones...Most of the shops sell articles which a normal person never can afford..

Liked the old marina bay from 25 years ago when tehre was the sateh market etc."
,,Worth visiting!!,4.0,,"The varieties of shops in terms of branded stuff, restaurants, fashions, cafe, bistro, food courts..really an all rounder! Worth spending a day shopping, visiting museumsand take a walk outside the building, you can simply see the beauty of Singapore!!"
,,Huge Designer Mall,4.0,,"huge mall with so many shops, designer goods abound and nothing is cheap (and not many people buying), but nice to wander through with so many products. There is a food court down the hotel foyer end that is good and the local office workers flock to. The water feature is interesting also. You can get from here to the Gardens but not well signposted."
,,Shopping mall,5.0,,I felt like I was in Venus the shopping area was made with a pond well more like a river running through with gondolas it was awesome
,,So many!,4.0,,"You need to keep a day free for this. More than 300 shops! None cheap, but absolutely everything you might want, and more!"
,,fantastic shopping and dining,5.0,,"what an amazing hotel,shops to die for and worth splashing out on a cocktail at Ku de ta for the spectacular views"
,,Fancy mall with fantastic food court!,4.0,,"Ritzy. I wasn't too terribly impressed, as this is similar to the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace or any other fancy shopping malls in Las Vegas. Of course, some of the stores had a more regional flavor, such as the birds nests for sale at Yummi House. (Not that I could afford to buy anything there.)

The Rasapura Masters food court was quite impressive though. Located next to a small ice skating rink that only little kiddies were partaking in, it was a food haven of sights, smells, and delectable delights. Like the food court at Westfield Century City shopping mall in Los Angeles, they provided ceramic dishware and real utensils--none of the disposable stuff, so you know it's fancy!

So many choices... so little time. I finally selected a delicious $7.00 bowl of bak kut teh--giant, succulent pork ribs in a yummy broth of Chinese herbs and spices. The next morning I got handmade ramen with shrimp and pork wantons for $6.80. Normally I wouldn't eat rice or noodles for breakfast, but I had to make an exception. :)

One station had steaming baskets of dim sum, and a mouth-watering display of assorted fried and baked delicacies. We got a peanut sesame ball and green bean sesame ball to go, and I finally got brave enough to use my broken Mandarin Chinese to the cashier. Felt really good when she understood me and didn't bat an eye at my mixed English-Chinese order. Prior to that, I've only tasted red bean sesame balls, but these different flavors were still very good. Sweet, oily, and chewy, we happily munched on our snacks and left The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands as happy campers. :)"
,,It is Huge!,5.0,,We recently stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for 3 nights just after the New Year. All the world big brand names are in this huge complex! The ladies of the family were having a great time. We loved having high tea at one of the TWG outlet after lots of walking around. There is a access to the roof which takes you to a skyway through the Marina Bay Sands to the Garden by the Bay! There are some spectacular photo spots along the way!
,,A Spectacularly Large Designer Mall,4.0,,"For size and designer lables this mall must take the prize, but for us it was window shopping not real retail therapy. Vivo City has a much better mix of shops and dining for most visitors.

The views from the Marina Prommenade are very spectacular by day or night."
,,Probably the best shopping mall in the world,5.0,,"I have been exposed to a lot of shopping malls all my life during my travels overseas and so far this is one of the best I have seen if not the best. What is impressive about this mall is that it is a one stop shop for all high end brands. Needless to say, you can skip Orchard Road if you are pressed for time. In addition, the architecture is impressive as well. Easily you can spend 2 days exploring this mall along with the other attractions on the side, i.e. the Gardens by the Bay ( which is just across the backside of the mall ). Just outside the entrance of the mall, i.e. at ground level you could see from a distance the Fullerton Hotel and the famous Merlion symbol against the backdrop of the Singapore river. When I visit Singapore again this coming March, I will come back to this place and explore it further."
,,Good for window shopping,4.0,,The mall is fantastic...but super costly and only meant for few elites/ millionaires. You can take gondola rides in artificially created river. Their was more people hanging outsidenthan in any of th shops. If you want to shop head to bug is junction.
,,Stay in SIngapore,5.0,,I loved the Marina Bay Sands complex--enormous..and you could live there for a week without leaving the complex.
,,Take your visitors here,5.0,,"I've been here many times. Each time bringing friends or family and even work colleagues. For a little shopping or a relaxing walk. Outside at night you can enjoy the Water & Lights show. Wonderful. That's what it's called: ""wonderful"". Have a vegetarian mediterranean tapas style meal at Pita Pan (near the museum). Ate there many times. Nice platters and falafels. My usual is pita pan, then ice cream from ColdRock and getting to show facing the bay. Sit too close to water side and you could get wet."
,,Great place for Couples,5.0,,"The Marina Bay Shoppes is a great place to go for couples , There are plenty of places to walk though the branded stuffs are only for the rich . The best would be the evening to the night , The scenery outside is just beautiful , Windy and cooling too . Bring your love ones here to shop and to chill :)"
,,World class !,4.0,,"The Marina Bay Shoppes building structure reminded me a lot of the Dubai Mall in the Middle East, elegant, classy, decadent but not vulgar in design. The the items there if on sale are really reasonably price compare vis a vis outside shops. Lots of dinig options, there is the food court and the high end ones like Wolfgang Puck ""Cut "", or Guy Savoy, etc. there is a laser, light at water show 3 sets every evening at the Promenade. Remember to visit at the South Promenade, a booth called The Social Pavillion, here you get to take pictures for free with the beautiful Marine Bay Sands iconic structures at the background , courtesy of the blue screen technology. At last a "" couple picture"" taken without bothering passerbys to take our picture ! Sampan ride in the Shoppes is a little lame compare with that of its sister hotel The Venetian, gondola ride with handsome singing gondoliers gliding along the Venetian canal, with realistic painted blue skies above, and charming Venetian buildings as you glide long the canal."
,,A genuine tourist attraction- remember: Sands is away from the city center- suggest you go by MRT,4.0,,"The Shoppes are worth a visit if you're visiting the Sands.

Maybe, the best thing to do is o make a day of it, and visit it as part of a day trip seeing several of the attractions in the vicinity- including the Casino, the Gardens, the SkyPark and the ArtScience Museum.

There's an MRT station: Bayfront- which makes the MRT an ideal way to get there."
,,"Even if you don't buy, it's THE place to window-shop",5.0,,"The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands are a must-visit on any trip to Singapore. If you are interested in luxury products, MBS has all the boutiques that are scattered amongst different shopping centres on Orchard Road, whereas at MBS the stores are all in the one place. Even if you are not buying, the island of Louis Vuitton is worth a visit for the bookstore and exhibitions. There is a fantastic, large food court overlooking the MBS skating rink, or perhaps have afternoon tea at the TWG branch over the MBS canal. There is also a branch of Kenko Reflexology and Fish Spa, so you can experience the quitessential Singaporean 'doctor fish' massage while you visit as well."
,,"Beautiful interior, even gondola-like boats mimicking Venice, LV store a must-see!",5.0,,"Huge shopping complex with interesting tourist-trap-like restaurants awaiting you. The Louis Vuitton store is a must-see, 2nd largest in the world, with an underpass, an art exhibit, 2 escalators, and an outdoor patio facing Marina Bay. The TWG tea shop is also a fun experience with over 800 selections. Food court has lots of selections. Nice walk around and time spent on a hot day in Singapore"
,,Shoppes shopping mall,5.0,,"Nice to see so many lovely things, even if its in the window. Big clean mall with good air con gets you something to do out of the heat of the day."
,,Awesome Laser Show,4.0,,"To get to Marina Bay Sands, I took the MRT and hop off at the Bayfront station, which is right at the basement of the shopping area. Don't hop off at the Marina Bay station unless you want to walk a few blocks more. The shoppes were okay, you can find so many designer stores and good places to eat and people-watch. But what impress me the most is the laser show at night. And the broad walk is a nice place to see lights of the Business District."
,,It's a mall - but it's a very cool looking mall,3.0,,It's a very high priced mall - but the buildings are very cool - it's free to walk around. I wandered from the mall to the hotel and took a look around. Not a lot to do if you aren't made of money - but it was dry compared to outside
,,Amazing Shopping Haven,3.0,,"Premium shops & great food court.

This is the places to visit if you need to get out of the heat!.

This area does get extremely busy with tourists however getting a cab is hassle free.

If you want to visit the casino remember to bring you're passport!"
,,A Must See Place in SG,4.0,,"This place I thought was spectacular: from shops to restaurants, from the grand canal to the casino. The attendant at the Sands membership desk was very friendly and accommodating. I enjoyed seeing other people having fun. When I visit Singapore again, this will be on top of my list next to RW Sentosa!"
,,Shopping..,3.0,,"It was quite a good shopping in Marina Bay Sands,,You can still shop for L'occintane, The Body Shop, Victoria Secret...not only branded outlet..

The toast box cafe price are much more pricy compare to those located in other malls...

There's a boat ride...but I wasn't into the ride :)"
,,Everthing under one roof,5.0,,"One of the best shopping mall in Singapore where you can find a lot of branded items here. I also like the layout of the mall, it's good and so easy to find your way around. The observation deck at the top floor is a must visit. With BayFront MRT station now connected to it at the basement, it is so much convenient."
,,Brilliant Shopping Centre,5.0,,"A new addition to Singapore, Marina Bay is brilliant for shopping and eating. Although the shopping center is quite mixed. The surrounding area is beautiful and quite peaceful along the bay."
,,Beautifull..,5.0,,"I could spend a week just at the Marina Bay Sands.. they have everything, - including the most beautifull shopping mall. Everywhere you go it is clean, new and modern. They have top of the line stores and you can easily spend a couple of thousand $ here..

The small gondols sailing around on the intimate artificial - somewhat commercial lakes creates a soothing atmosphere for the guests. ."
,,Huge...with nothing usefull in it,2.0,,"Nice location, nice waterfront walk, nice design, but no usefull shops inside...at least not for me. All very very high end, nothing for kids but everything for gamblers who just won the jackpot."
,,Beautiful mall,4.0,,"This shopping mall is obviously geared at rich tourists, but can be enjoyable for locals as well.

The entire mall is beautifully designed, and the walkways are nice and wide. The mall lets in a lot of natural light, which is wonderful, making the entire place bright and airy. Even if you don't buy anything, it's quite enjoyable to just take a walk in the large shopping mall or do some window shopping.

It's many celebrity chef restaurants are definitely a great draw and having afternoon tea at TWG or TCC is very enjoyable as well. The ambience and environment are both very good. So far, I've been to DB Bistro and Pizzeria Mozza and both served excellent food. I'd make a special trip to MBS just for that.

The prices that the food court charges are higher than your average hawker center but this being the atas MBS, it is understandable. The food there is average, not exceptional, but good enough for recharging from shopping. A skating rink at the center of the food court is an added bonus, especially for those with kids. The rink can transform into an exhibition gallery, such as for the Narnia exhibition last year.

As for actual shopping, it boasts of a wide array of brand names, such as LV, Chanel, Prada etc etc. This is not your neighborhood mall so don't expect cheap bargains anywhere. It may be difficult to do any shopping if you are on a budget as most of the shops here sell expensive stuff.

A definite must-go for tourists, and also an enjoyable place to chill out for locals."
,,Incredible architecture & great view of the Singapore Skyline.,5.0,,"The shopping Centre is beautiful - with prices to match (pricey). It was lovely to walk around admiring the canal inside, the variety of eateries & with the MRT connected to the mall - everything is so accessible.

I had scones, cream & tea jelly at TWG Tea and tried the Earl Gray Armor tea - yum!

I was too scared to go to the Skypark because I'm scared of heights, but next time I will brave it!"
,,Shopper's Delight!,5.0,,"Good thing some of the shoppes are on sale, some offer a 20% discount on purchase, there are a variety of shops to go to & it likewas provides your with a boatride along the shoppes, so cool.."
,,Top tips for visiting Shoppes at Marina Bay sands,3.0,,"Tip 1: I wouldn't bother going to the shops in this mall because they sell mainly luxury goods that have been heavily marked-up.

Tip 2: However the food court is amazing because they sell all sorts of local singaporean food and international food, of course! From roti prata to beef pizzas, you can find anything in the food court. Beware, its quite pricey but certainly worth trying a few local dishes while you are there

Tip 3: it is certainly a place for high-end shoppers. Do drop by the Louis Vuitton shop as they have a mini exihibition down at the basement. Its free and its quite interesting! Thats probably the main highlight.

Please click 'Yes' If you think my reviews have been helpful to you."
,,Moving around shopping mall at marina bay sands hotel,3.0,,Great time in evening by moving saround shopping area at marina bay sands hotel. A very nice laser show and baoting experience in reserviour.
,,"Stunning mall, in the shadow of the Skypark",5.0,,"This mall is a HUGE open-plan space with several wings and 3 floors. We had seen several shops specialising in Birds' Nests or other health related things, but saw a lovely classy shop here specialising in 'Cordyceps', a strange medicinal thing which looks like dried worms! Amazing Mall, not necessary a place to shop, just to wander round. Even if it were busy, it still could not be crowdwd. Soft music playing - and even live music at one end. It is a very relaxing place to be. Anyone would enjoy it, even if you don't like shops - and with the skypark looming overhead it is just surreal."
,,WOW,5.0,,"No rich enough to stay at Marina Bay Sands, but did the tour on the roof of the complex..... well worth the visit. The shopping centre with all its rich and famous shops.... wow... note to self... take more money next time. Husband spent $1k in Harley Davidson shop on shirts, t shirts and jeans. Great helpful staff !"
,,Beautiful and very lavish,4.0,,"Great to see such a lavish mall, although food court area was disappointing. The restaurants are far better than the food court area."
,,Great Shopping,4.0,,Underground shopping mall that links to Raffles City & SunTek - some great shops but not cheap!! Some great food to be found and a wide variety of stores
,,Awful service at an expensive place,1.0,,"NO PUBLIC PHONES!!! In a shopping mall. ""It's a resort, there's a business centre"" the info counter guy limply said. No, it's a public mall! For all the expense lavished on this place you would think a few public phones would be possible. Not everyone has a mobile phone, and not every tourist carries one. To add insult to injury, not even a phone at Bayfront MRT. MRT stations always have phones. Come on Singapore, get your act together and provide tourists with some decent service."
,,Good shopping,4.0,,"Really good shopping here, both in the ultra expensive and the not-so-expensive shops. And the ice skating rink was delightful. The food court was also interesting with extremely good service for such a court."
,,shoppers paradise,4.0,,"Have been visting this place annually for the past 3 years and have seen marked improvements.
There are more shops now and bigger crowds. This is like shopping along the famous Orchard Road except that the shops are now contained in a huge complex. All type of branded stuff and you can shop in comfort. Several eateries within the complex to fill your hungry stomachs while shopping. There is also the Marina Sands Casino within the complex if you want to try your luck.
Spacious and nicely decorated.
Getting in and out is easy as it is located near the city with plenty of taxis on queue.
Worth a visit even if window shopping only."
,,A big and expensive mall - so what?,3.0,,"Well, we found this mall to be huge, expensive, but what can we say - well located. Take an hour to do some window shopping, as buying stuff here would pretty much be wasting your money."
,,It's huge!,5.0,,"It's a big mall so prepare yourself with a pair of comfortable shoes if you want to shop there. A lot of stores to go around. Great architectural design, so even you're in the mall still can enjoy the nice sunshine."
,,Great Window Shopping,4.0,,"This place is nice to walk through, but that's pretty much all we did. We stopped at a few stores that grabbed our attention, but we quickly realized that everything was out of our price range. The food is also expensive but it's very good and worth the time and money to stop and eat."
,,Disappointing,2.0,,I agree with previous reviewers that it's a strictly window shopping only for us mere mortals. The three eateries we tried during our visit were all disappointing serving very poor quality food for high end prices.
,,Good designer shopping,4.0,,"Lots of designer stores and some cheaper options too. The idea is quite novel with the mini river through the middle, although a bit cheesy. If you want to do a lot of shopping then this is a good place to head to."
,,Little venice in the mall,4.0,,"I like the concept of the mall, which you can feel like little venice with river, gondola and bridge in the mall. And also the roof which is completely visible for natural light.

You should come here if you want to shop for branded like LV, prada, burberry, hermes, etc."
,,Very high end shops mostly out of our price range but good food at Rasapura Masters Foodcourt,3.0,,"The shopping centre in Marina Bay Sands is worth a look just for the sake of it when you visit for the sky park or light show, mostly high end shops we wouldnt even window shop in! We had a meal in the Rasapura Masters Foodcourt twice though and found it reasonably priced and very nice food...very busy though and it was a struggle to find seats.
If shopping for labels is your thing you would be in the right place, we preferred some of the other 'malls' though that had more of a middle of the range selection. It is a nice environment particularly the outdoor area where Arts & Science centre is, we relaxed out there and enjoyed the view with a cold drink."
,,Posh,5.0,,"My expectation of Marina Bay was high so it didn't come off as a surprise when I saw how glamorous the Shoppes was. One thing for sure, this is aimed to the rich as every stores are designers and luxurious ones. Still, one can still marvel the interiors of the Shoppes. Inspired by the Venice, the place has man-made river with gondolas plying through."
,,Cozy Malls,5.0,,"For me i can say that , this is one of the best malls i've ever been ! the architect is beautiful combining modern and minimalist style. The main entrance is right across the Marina Bay Sands and the other one is the Singapore Skyline view! that's awesome! Cool shop and all the famous brand is here. The Entertainment is awesome it has The Sands Theatre where we can watch all the best performing arts & concerts. Not to mention the Canal and the gondola in the middle of the malls. What else can i say? Its Super Entertaining!"
,,"Money, money, money",3.0,,"This shopping centre caters strictly ONLY for those who are RICH. For the rest of us humble eathlings, we have to make do with only window shopping. There is a mini waterway inside the shopping centre & I wonder why on earth do people want to get on the boat? There is NO view, except for shops. This is NOT Venice, please.

Rasapura Masters Foodcourt - A very expensive foodcourt! A plate of mixed vegetables rice with 2 meat & 1 vegetable cost $9.90!!! Maybe it is cheap by European or ANZ standard, but certainly NOT for our standard as we can find the same fare at only $3 at coffee shops or $5 at other food courts."
,,Rasapura Masters Foodcourt,4.0,,"Family holiday outing visit the Newly opened Garden @ the Bay...mainly tourist and long Q for ticket.Decide to end the stroll and head for Singapore Icon Marina Bay Sands Hotel........decide to have dinner in the famous food court for tourist : ""rasa-pura"".
No fuss for tables though usually crowded...not surprise as all are here to view and experience.Got our table by the skating rings and ordered......kids got their western food & pizza.Price reasonable in an air-conditioned environment.Wife had some authentic ""Malay Nasi Padang"" pricey though and for me settle for some salmon salad and a blend of coffee.
Thumb up for cleaners that are efficient and cleaning tables for the next customer."
,,Great mix of shops!,4.0,,"I love shopping here with their great shop mix, from branded boutiques like LV, Chanel, Bottega, Prada, to other shops like Sephora, guardian pharmacies, Adiddas, etc, you will find almost all the popular shops here. Also, they offer free parking when you shop during Monday to Thursday from 10-4pm with a minimum spending of $20nett. Happy shopping"
,,MARINA BAY SANDS an amazing experience of modern architecture,5.0,,"They say “Asia’s most spectacular and versatile destination” and nothing could be truer. Standing right at the base of this amazing building we felt with our 5.6” dwarfed and not only that your necks would not tilt back far enough to see the top! MARINA BAY SANDS has three hotel towers and is “crowned” by the magnificent “Sands SkyPark”. During the day it is breath-taking but at night it is beyond words. You can virtually see 360 degrees, The railing consists of (we hope it is well tested!) thick transparent plastic. Yes, we have fear of heights but proudly we can say…we “did it”… and went right up to the very end, leaned on the plastic plateau and just took photos and marvelled at this masterpiece of architecture. There are dining facilities, inside and outside, however we were told that reservations are now taken for the end of 2013. We did not want to wait that long for dinner…! MARINA BAY SANDS houses one of the largest and most coveted designer boutiques and celebrity chef restaurants in the region, infinitely configurable “SANDS EXPO and CONVENTION CENTRE” as well as the unique “ARTSCIENCE MUSEUM”. This museum is housed in “THE LOTUS” another breath-taking piece of modern architecture. MARINA BAY SANDS is easy accessible for seniors, wheelchairs and strollers. There is an entrance fee for the “SKYPARK”,”SANDS EXPO” and “ARTSCIENCE”."
,,"Very Nice, but Find a Local to Tell You Where the ""Real"" Shopping Is",4.0,,"Yes, it's mainly for tourists, and pricey. For most of us with an afternoon or two to kill shopping and wanting to experience ""high society"" Singapore, don't miss it . . . and, hit the ION for that matter as well. But, there are alot of reasonably priced malls selling most of the same products, and many are within walking distance of these more pricey malls. Ask any taxi driver."
,,Retail Therapy Overload!!!!,5.0,,"Wow, so many boutique and designer stores, love everthing about the Sands! Could have easily spent a fortune, Ferrari Shop there for the boys too. Great food court and michelin star restuarants."
,,High-end shops,3.0,,My daughter and I strolled inside the Marina Bay Sands after our long walk inside the Gardens By The Bay. It was a huge mall with plenty of high-end shops. I didn't buy anything because they were costly but it was nice to see the Venetian-like water way in the middle of the mall with a different version of Gondolas passing by a seemingly torrential down-pour. Nice!
,,Strictly window shopping only,4.0,,"It's worth going at least once - to walk through to get to the ArtScience Museum near the standalone LV store outside - most of the brands here are pretty high end.

There's a Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf Beanstro if you want something different from the other Coffee Bean outlets.

There's plenty to look at, but really..."
,,Amazing view,5.0,,First of all the building itself is a masterpiece. The ship like top with over hanging deck is amazing. Great view from the top all around Singapore. God shopping and dining places to add to the attraction. WOW!
,,Mall-type experience,3.0,,"The Shoppes is a fairly large and mid-price to luxury shopping mall connected to the Marina Bay Sands. Everything has a brandnew and flashy look and feel to it, especially the Louis Vuitton ""island"" shop which is placed in the water.
Personally, I preferred Esplanade as it had a more local feel to it. But if you are going for French or Italian fashion or Swiss watches, this is the place to be (which does not make much sense coming from Europe)."
,,Magicial shopping centre,5.0,,"I've been to many different shopping centres in my life and this was amazing! I would highly recommend a trip just for a look. I didn't buy anything but was entertained by the indoor lake with boat rides, the ice rink and the amazing casino architecture. Imagine the architect saying to the owners ""well you said you wanted something a little different so here you go....."". Free or expensive - you choose. With out a doubt 100% magic."
,,Just amazing,5.0,,"We have visited some great shopping centres (including in Las Vegas) and Marina Bay Sands takes the cake !!

Design, size and the array of shops makes this a ""must see"". You should also visit the Sky Deck at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel which is connected to the Shopping Centre - fabulous views of Singapore and the Sky Bar is a great place for a drink."
,,EXCELLENT MALL IN SINGAPORE- MUST SEE!!,5.0,,"This mall completely wowed us. It's part of the Marina Bay Sands complex and contains restaurants, upscale shops (Louis Vuitton, Hermes) as well as a Venetian type boat ride (kinda cool). Great way to escape the heat and get some refreshments, while browsing the great shops."
,,Shopping with a View :),3.0,,"Good shopping, with most high-end boutiques and also high street labels all under one roof. It has some good activity joints for kids too like a skating rink and a play-gym to leave the kids ( at an affordable price of S$22 for 2 hrs) while you shop-till you drop ! :))

However, was a little disappointed that the Robinsons Store was rather small and does not have a children's department. And oh yes, if you wish to buy childrens stuff like clothes etc that do not cost a BOMB, the shoppes at MBS is the wrong place to go.

Many fancy restaurants to wine and dine and also comes with a food-court with GREAT food to boost :)) The chicken rice is simply awesome !"
,,Remember your budget!,4.0,,"It's a high end mall with every famous labels in here. Obviously, it's an expensive mall but worth to view with the gondolas in it and everything else. People throws their pennies on level one in the outside and at night it turns to a waterfall, making all the pennies go down to the river where the gondolas are. Easy access by MRT."
,,A great mall but it will break the bank,3.0,,Great high end shopping mall if you only want to window shop. Prices of designer goods are well above Aussies prices and US travelers will have heart palps when they check out the price tag. Worth a look but leave your Visa card at home :-)
,,"The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, Singapore",5.0,,"This is the most amazing shopping experiences ever even if you don't actually enter any of the shops or do any shopping! The centre is enormous and on several floors linked by escalator and glass lifts. It is spotlessly clean with polished floors and even some carpeted areas. There is a roller-skating rink, a wide variety of different restaurants, bars and food-outlets plus a large food-court. Our favourite cafe for coffee or tea was situated right on the edge of of the indoor canal where one can sit and enjoy delicious cakes whilst watching people punting past in little boats. There is a huge array of exclusive label shops many of them with unusual and very creative window displays. It never seems to be crowded but only starts to open up about ten or eleven in the morning and doesn't close till late at night. Wi Fi is available in some of the bars."
,,Shopping at Marina Square,5.0,,Every brand is just there and it's quiet. Shopping is made easy. I just love the mall!
,,What a complex!,5.0,,"This has everything that makes an enjoyable experience. After going to the top of the MArina Sands HOtel we spent a few hours in the MAll. Probably the best one in the world and we have been to a lot. After the shopping mall experience just outside at 8pm there is a laser show which is also outstanding and is free. The whole MArina complex is A must if you are in Singapore, in fact the whole of SIngapore is a must visit place. You will not regret it."
,,Lion King at the Sands Theater,5.0,,"While waiting for Lion King to open, we went around the impressive mall. I particularly remembered the glass ceiling fronting the theater and the delightful dinner at Kraze Burgers at the food court. The Lion King show was spectacular as expected. We had to hurry out quickly right after the show as we still had to walk a bit going to the nearest MRT station to catch the last train to Somerset. Too bad we missed taking photos of the lovely Marina Bay at night."
,,Not just a mall - a destination!,5.0,,"Yes, it's a mall, but what a mall!
From highbrow to humdrum, every category of shop is here, and hey, even if you can't afford Chanel and Gucci and all the others, it's great fun to look!
A geat respite from the heat and surprisingly I actually purchased some stuff here too!"
,,Above the shoppes,3.0,,"Upon entering the Marina Bay Sands complex, the shopping gallery was overwhelming and I even noticed a Jim Thompson silk store (more on Jim later). At this point in the evening with dinner and a walk, I felt it necessary to find the commode. The men’s room was surprisingly clean for a toilet in such a large public complex, and the equipment was very modern unlike what will read about later in other countries. Although the family seemed concern that it took some time for me to return, things were fine thanks to the daily consumption of that little pink pill called Pepto-Bismol.

After finding the lift to the bar and the viewing area at the top of the Marina Bay Sands, which is cantilever design that resembles a surf board resting on three pillars 57stories above the bay, we experienced some confusion on the cost of the elevator and the remaining time we would be able to enjoy the evening view. We were first told it would cost $80 for the four of us to ride to the observation deck for the remaining 20 minutes of viewing time. Not to be too frugal on the adventure but being a Scotsman by heritage, I decided to do some additional investigation. I found many patrons using the lift without the $20 per person voucher that we had been told we needed, so with a little encouragement, we boarded the lift expecting to be denied entry to whatever was above us. When we exited the elevator, we noticed a bar area outside with a wonderful view of the harbor, above the city skyline and beyond. After entering the bar, I quickly realized that the $20 lift fare would be a small price to pay when compared to drinking and dinning at this level. The white wine at $24 Sing, my gin and tonic at $18 Sing and Tiger beer at $16 Sing quickly added up to a $150.00.

During the picture taking, cocktailing and chit chat with other ex-pats and tourists, we discovered that the observation deck was just below the bar but provided no better views or access to the length of this huge surfboard. While we drank from the bow, you look towards the stern and see the famous infinity pool where guests from the hotel had a unique bathing experience overlooking Singapore with no edge in sight. After paying the bar tab, we walked to the MRT station in the Marina Bay Sands and navigated three lines back to Tanglin Halt 10-story block 28 7th floor. After arriving at midnight with sore feet, a swollen knee and mild perspiration, I decided a good day was had and sleep was needed.

,,Nice Mall,4.0,,"Since we stayed at Marina Bay Sands, this is the mall we visited most. They have very expensive, high-end shops. Singapore prices are also very high compared to Hong Kong so I wasn't able to do much shopping. The Shoppes also lack restaurants. During mealtimes, you can see long lines for tables outside restaurants. They also lack seating for tired shoppers.

However, the mall is very clean, there are helpful concierges and window shopping is nice. The SA's are all very helpful even though you're just window shopping. At the center of the mall is the Rain Oculus (like a water bowl) and you can take a mini gondola ride around it for S$10."
,,Amazing shopping Centre,5.0,,This shopping centre was amazing and so modern. It also had the best eatery section on the ground floor with every sort of Asian food imaginable
,,Very expensive place to shop in.,4.0,,"Marina Bay Sands is a very expensive place to shop in. Unless you have money to burn, do not buy anything. But you can look around as the place is quite nice."
,,Lovely new area.,5.0,,"It's all about eating and shopping here. Lovely a hopping brand new mall but polish ur credit card!!!! All very ""posh"" a Shops. Good eating place within the mall, cheap and all wry fresh, lovely cooking"
,,Fabulous but way too expensive everything!,4.0,,"Nice restaurants and sights! But the shops are seriously expensive and not kids-friendly. However, the outdoor area is very cozy and breezy. We can walk and sit around on the boardwalk while looking at Singapore's cityscape."
,,Branded shops .. nothing else,3.0,,"spacious layout laid out with many specialty brand shops. Unless you are loaded with cash to shop in top fashion brands or visit the casino, you would have nothing much to do here other than some photo taking."
,,A lovely walk,4.0,,Loved the shops. From super high end to affordable
,,Best luxury mall in Singapore,4.0,,"Pretty much the best luxury mall in Singapore since Orchard road has everything so splattered. The prices in Singapore are not competitive but the venue is the best Singapore's got to offer. No match to Dubai for example but still pretty good. Nice mall with a lot to see and pretty nice shops including Chanel, Vuitton (realy nice building on the water), Fendi, Prada ex cetera. Also really nice promenade via the water and also the casino is within the mall. So all in all pretty much the place to spend time in Singapore."
,,Like a soulless version of The Venetian,3.0,,"Marina Bay Sands has a casino somewhere, hidden behind this enormous shopping mall. When designing it, I think they took modernism a bit too far; instead of the plastercast fakery of the Venetian in Macau, here it's all giant metal spars and gleaming glass, and when the shops are bastions of humanity in this dislocated space, you know something's awry.

Also, like the Venetian, a river of sorts runs through it, complete with some gondolas that look really out of place amongst all those clean, surgical lines.

There's a good range of shops in here: well, as well as the mindbendingly expensive designer goods we all expect in our casino resort complexes, there's a pharmacist and a branch of Cold Storage, Singapore's rather threateningly named supermarket. There's a lot of restaurants: we dined in the surprisingly good Mozza, a pizzeria opposite the entrance to the theatre.

On a Thursday evening, the Shoppes were almost empty, and that may have contributed to the subdued feel. It's an enormous space, so be prepared for a lot of walking once you're inside; taking the MRT to the shoppes doesn't mean you will be right in the middle of things.

It's sort of a must-see in Singapore, if only because the building is so big you can hardly avoid seeing it. Not so sure it's worth going inside unless you're on your way to the theatre or you are incredibly rich and want to divest yourself of some cash very fast though."
,,Really Nice place to look around - Car Parking problem though,3.0,,"Upon arrival at The Shoppes Marina Bay Sands on a Friday Evening we entered the ramp down into the main car park and then was stuck in a jam - Car park full. Had to wait between 10 to 15 minutes before could insert the Car pass thingy. No choice but to queue as could not go backwards as many cars behind.
Upon entering the car park had to search for the limited spaces - as indicated by the green/red lights over the car park bays. But this system is flawed as if the car does not park perfectly in the space then it shows green and actually there is no space. After driving around for 5 to 10 minutes parked.

The Shoppes is really fantastic with every shop over 3 floors. Really nice layout and not crowded. Plenty of things to see and do but I would say 90% of the sops are out of the price range of 90% of people. Just all branded shops with guys at the doors of the shop waiting to open the door for you - then you know its going to be so expensive.

A nice food court inside with reasonable prices and a wide variety of food.

Worth a visit but don't expect to buy anything much as the prices are just too high."
,,Went to the theater here,3.0,,"I went to this mall because I had purchased a ticket to see Wicked the musical while in Singapore. Much to my surprise the theater is in the mall. While waiting to see the show I walked around, ate at the food court, got a foot reflexology treatment and then finally it was time for Wicked. This place didn't seem nearly as busy as other malls I've been to in Singapore. The fountains are a nice feature. I considered eating at Mario Batali's restaurant but I wasn't very hungry."
,,Nice to visit it,4.0,,"We've been to the shopping mall at Marina Bay Sands on several occasions .While there we didn't shop, walked a little and eaten a little. You can go for a boat ride in the water canal inside the mall ,you can go to the casino where you can go and lose the money you've net spent on shopping. (need passport identity if you want to enter the casino)
The mall has in addition to the canal an ice skating ring & different cuisine restaurants where you can eat. The MRT station is now open but not easy to find it , the signs inside the mall are not enough. The sky walk is nice it costs 20$ but the view is great. The area outside the mall on the river side is really nice where you enter the museum or to take the Singapore boat for a ride. At night you you can watch the fountain musical show.
Finally it's a nice place to visit but not for shopping better to go to orchard."
,,Average high end mall,4.0,,"Unlike other singapore malls, this mall has a very high veiling but narrower walking areas that stretch very long. This helps cut down on the crowd and claustrophobia. Plus there are many areas of attraction to diffuse the crowd - the waterway, the casino, the hotel, the waterfront, the museum, that you don't really see a crowd. But shop selections is not too great. The designer restaurants are a bigger draw though. For the shopping experience, just average. For a day out, very pleasant."
,,Impressive upmarket mall,4.0,,"The MBS Shoppes are very spacious and inviting, arguably the only downtown mall in Singapore that does not give the.visitor claustrophobia. Great to walk around at least once, if only just to view Ned Khan's rain oculus, the Shoppes' iconic feature. The MBS Shoppes with its pricey branded shops is obviously targetted at the fashionista with deep pockets, unlike the Venetian Macau's Grand Canal Shoppes which has a broader tenant mix with something to suit every budget."
,,great mall but don't shop there!,5.0,,"The mall is spectacular and as far as I have seen, unequalled in other parts of the world, but it's the same old shops over & over again...also very expensive and I discovered the same items much cheaper in NY."
,,greatest place at all,5.0,,"this is the place you want to hangout, all branded store are here if you have a lot of money to spend, but everything are charged. yes, marina bay sand is awesome place."
,,These shops were overpriced and the centre was too big!,3.0,,"I was not impressed with Marina Bay Sands Shopping Centre. It was too big and it was very difficult to find your way around even if you tried to follow the virtual maps or the (not so helpful) signs. It took us ages to find the MRT station and the food court (although it was handy that the MRT station was located inside the centre). When we did find the food court it was so over crowded that everyone was staring at you while you ate and the group of 5 we were in had to split up. The food was average too, I would have much preferred to have dinner elsewhere! I found that there were too many shops, which would be ok if you just wanted to browse but if you were looking for a particular shop it would be hell! It was also super busy which made it even more difficult to get around. The views out onto the bay are nice and we went up to the Skypark viewing tower which at $20Singapore was pretty steep but worth a look. Honestly, I wouldn't recommend going there unless you ran out of things to do, check out the shops on Bugis street and Orchard street before bothering to go to Marina Bay Sands!"
,,Good Snack Fare Outdoors,4.0,,"The interior restaurants located in the Marina Bay Shopping Mall are not very appealing on a warm day/evening. However, the small, outdoor bars offer a light snack fare with a front-seat view of the light show and all the people watching one could hope for."
,,"Huge shipping centre, sky walk has amazing views",4.0,,"Visited this shopping centre. The mrt train station underneath it is now open so it's easy to get there. Its almost empty of people as singapore has so many shops. The staff stand around bored. However its a great place to see some new architecture and there is a big range of shops. I think there is more choice at orchard rd though. There are some good restaurants and a small food court.

I paid the $20 fee to go to the top of the hotel where there is a viewing platform. The views are amazing and it's a good way to see the cbd towers. You cannot access the gardens at the top if you are not a guest of the hotel. It's $100 for a local to get into the casino. Foreigners can get in free if they have their passport.

The inside of the hotel (foyer) could have been spectacular but its unimpressive."
,,Venice in a Mall,4.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands mall is full of very expensive shops and all the major brandnames are here. It is interesting to walk around the different levels but many shops are of the type 'you don't feel well dressed enough to even enter the shop/boutique'.
The food court on the lower floor is modern,extensive,clean and has consistently good food but is obviously more expensive than outside hawker centres.
Unless you are a hotel guest you cannot take the lift up to the top floor of the hotel to see the infinity pool etc which is a shame.
The helix bridge is architectural eye candy and enjoyable to walk across to get to the mall.
Whereas at the Emirates mall in Dubai you have the Snowdome and skiing, in the Marina Bay mall you have a canal and gondolas that you can ride on - so Venice in the city (of Singapore!). Not sure why you'd bother with everyone watching though.
To enter the casino you must be over 21, suitably attired and if not a Singapore resident you must bring your passport along with you as proof of identity (driver's licence not enough).
This mall is worth a visit to while away a few hours in the cool."
,,An exclusive mall,4.0,,"Marina Bay sands is a beautiful hotel surrounded by the shopping mania of the mall. The shops are all branded and very expensive, so if you are looking for bargains, this is not the place for you.

The laser light show outside the mall if front of the Louis Vuitton shop is amazing. It happens every night at 8pm and is really beautiful"
,,Massive Shopping Area,4.0,,"Big, modern shopping complex with marina walk, bars, restaturants and casino. nice place to shop or just walk though and explore."
,,Spacious Mall - Great Fountain,4.0,,"The malls at Marina Sands are aimed at the upper budget. They house the premium brands that you would expect in a high-end mall.

There are some more reasonable stores there however and the cafe's are not too expensive. The open plan nature of Marina Bay means you can get from the mall straight through the the hotel, Casino, Theatre or on to the Promenade. Well worth a walk around if you are in the area to visit the top of Marina Bay or the Casino."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Ok, most of the stores are way out of my price range. that said, $$ didn't stop me from enjoying the mall. its clean, well kept, beautifully designed, and the clerks at most of the stores are quite nice, some don't always have a good grasp of English, but hey. all in all, a wonderful shopping experience."
,,Pretty dead high-end mall,3.0,,"The shopping centre looks like it was built in a hurry. The quality of workmanship is lacking but the shops sell mostly high-end pricey stuffs! Whoever go in there must have reeally deep pockets. It was weekday n there was hardly any souls. Maybe it could be more crowded during weekends. We only 'admire' those slanted cheap looking lightings n air-con grilles. The only things thats not so high-end, fortunately, is the foodcourt in the middle."
,,Too Extravagant,3.0,,"The location may be great - the Marina Bay Sands - but the shops are not all that exciting and too overly priced. At first instant the Marina Bay Sands attracts millions of tourists, but once they are in they will begin to wonder what the fuss was to begin with. Most tourists do not even bother going inside as they are too afraid to find out what the prices are like - so the salesmen/women are left wandering around inside their stores. I saw a few interesting places - an Art Gallery, and a chocolatterie, but apart from that there is not much attraction - very disappointing! The only consolation is the fantastic water and light show taking place outside the Marina Bay Sands on the water - that is truly spectacular and in one word - phenomenal!!!"
,,Nice Wonder Full Water Show,4.0,,"My boyfriend and I ended up our last night at Singapore with the Wonder Full water Show at Marina Bay Sands. We arrived at there half an hour earlier. We enjoyed the lights and beautiful night view while waiting for the show. For those photography lovers, don't forget to bring along your camera and take few snaps of beautiful night scene.
Do drop by Marina Bay Sands and have a look at the Wonder Full water Show. It's FREE!! For more information, you may refer to the following link:

,,"lots of fun, wear comfortable walking shoes, there is a lot to see",5.0,,"There is a lot to see, the complex was on several levels, and after a lot of window browsing, we stopped for afternoon tea at a small cute tearoom on a bridge arching over the indoor canal, there was a really good selection of teas and we shared a plate of scones which was just as well because it was more than enough for two. The various teas available were fascinating, made me realize how little I know about tea.

We had a great time."
,,Haven for tourist,5.0,,"It was a memorable trip as this is my first trip to Singapore. What I've heard before are all true, very clean city, no cops in view. Just discovered that people during daytime, walk in the underground to go places and be connected thru the MRT. The Marina Sands area so fabulous specially during nighttime. The shows are fantastic specially the Wonderful World wherein water dances in different colors and a reminder that we have to love nature. I kept on recording the entire show using my apple itouch tho' not minding the raindrops and lo when I arrived in my hotel room..the gadget moist and half of the itouch screen has watermarks on it.....really unforgettable..good thing when I came back to Manila...the thing could be traded in...!!!"
,,"More great shopping and finally, fabulous coffee in Singapore!",5.0,,"The Shoppes is 5 floors of shopping underneath the Marina Bay Sands Hotel.
Large selection of high end and medium range shopping to keep you busy for a couple of days if it's raining. Interesting canal and water feature in the middle.
Found fantastic coffee at Java Detour - Melbourne standards.
Large selection of eateries and enjoyed great dim sum in the 'food hall'"
,,Good shopping centre however not cheap,4.0,,"Pretty good shopping centre at the bottom (and nearby) of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. The shoppes are like a normal flash shopping centre, well set out, with a large eatery area.
However, wouldnt say its cheap. It would have been cheaper in Australia with a lot of the shopping, however with the shopping centres in Singapore now, that appears to be standard. Better to shop in the side streets however quality of course may be compromised.
The eatery was below average. The food was nothing like the pictures. Portions were small, food was expensive and not very nice to eat. DO NOT get the dim sum. Very dissapointing.
Also visited the top floor pool area of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Was a little expensive (around $30 singapore i believe) but well worth the view of Singapore. Dont think the set up was very good for hotel guests though, as you had an awning type of thing trying to block the pool away from tourists walking around the roof, which was a bit un-private for hotel guests. I wouldnt have been very happy being a guest at the hotel with people peering through the awning trying to get a view of the pool.
Anyway, worth the look but was a little over rated and dissapointed."
,,High end shopping,4.0,,"The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands is a luxury shopping mall containing high-end retailers such as Bulgari, Burberry, Cartier, Christian Dior, Fendi, Ferragamo, Ferrari, Gucci, Hugo Boss etc.

Even for Singapore, this is a grand mall with a modern, contemporary and open design, allowing the visitor to also admire the views of Singapore city. In fact at the time of our visit a famous Australian writer was being interviewed for a local tv show.

The mall has a skating rink as well as a canal that takes visitors on a relaxing boat ride through the retail area in a sampan.

The Mall and the Marina Bay Sands hotel is an extension of Singapore in the bay area designed to maybe attract the well heeled. Part of it seems to be a reaction to the development in Dubai, which seems to have cornered the markets in outlandish hotels and shopping malls mixed with a bit of Las Vegas dash.

You might not be able to afford the prices charged in the designer shops but its worth dropping by."
