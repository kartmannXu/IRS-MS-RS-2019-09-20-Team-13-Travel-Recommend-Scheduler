,,Nice thoroughfare in Little Malay,4.0,,Came here as part of our city tour and enjoyed walking around in the little shops. A nice range of boutiques and authentic ethnic stores complement the few bars and cafes; one can have a nice 30 minutes or make an afternoon of the street. Recommended.

,,Quirky,4.0,,"Haji Lane is a shopping area in Singapore dedicated to small boutiques and coffee shops / restaurants. It comprises of small lanes selling tourist nik naps to clothing and homeware in some quaint boutiques. What makes it different is the colourful street art that adornes the buildings and streets. I teresting and colourful and great for some dufferent photo opportunities. Wander, shop, drink, eat and take in the atmosphere and sounds. A popular area and well worth a visit for a morning or afternoon. There are several streets to browse including Arab street where there is a large Mosque you can visit."

Filled with artisan shops, boutiques, independent clothing stores, cool bars, delicious eateries and much more. Highly recommend staying around this area, it’s has it all."
,,Must visit,5.0,,Definitely recommend visiting Haji Lane whilst in Singapore. So many unique little boutique shops and cafes. The street art is cool too.

,,One of my favourite areas in Singapore,5.0,,Definitely a hipster area of Singapore. With lots of quirky shops and cafes. haji lane is well worth a visit.
,,Hipster,4.0,,"A street full of artsy shops & cafes. Very nicely decorated with lots of graffiti art. Perfect photo spot. The items sold in the shops are rather pricey, but they are quite unique & aesthetic pieces."
,,Vibrant colours,5.0,,Too many bars nearby here with many Turkish inspired items to purchase. Should I say perhaps a mini Istanbul or Dubai? Yes it was... tourist attraction and try to avoid the noon time due to hot sun. Evening should be the best time to have a date out. Try pedra it's well known here...
,,Vibrant,5.0,,"Taxi driver took us here on the recommendation of a local. Colourful street art, variety of stalls, all buzzing. Loved the vibe"
,,Not enouhg time!,3.0,,"This is a must if you are in the area. I visited this area at night, not so much throughout the day. The night life is great and is a must if you are looking for a good night of dancing and music."
,,Hipster Central,5.0,,Beautiful Street full of small Shop Houses with many Boutique shops and cafes hip bars and artisan souvenirs. There are many hostels here too so most of the crowd is young backpackers. There is beautiful graffiti which makes the place look bright and colorful not much for the kids to do here but it's definitely worth a visit.
,,Cute street with shops and restaurants,3.0,,"Probably I would not go out of my way to visit Haji Lane, but since we were in the area we did a walk through as well as to take a few snapshots of the graffiti covered wall at the junction between Beach Road and Ophir Road.

Haji Lane is kind of cute place to visit with some interesting stores and food places with lots of people taking selfies. We almost stopped at a restaurant called the Mad Sailors British Kitchen, but found it to be a bit grotty and when we went inside and sat down to look at the menu we were told that all the tables inside were reserved and that we'd either have to sit outside in the heat or sit at the bar by the window which we thought not too appropriate since we had young children with us. Since nobody else was sitting inside the place and the prices on the menu seemed a bit expensive, we decided to skip eating here.

Further down this small street were a couple of other eat places and shops selling this and that and we quickly arrived at the end of this street without finding much of interest. There was actually a place called Miao Cat Cafe just around the corner but it didn't look too interesting and was quite small inside so we skipped that too and moved on to Arab Street and other more interesting areas nearby."
,,Love the vibes,5.0,,Luckily this area was just below my hotel. Heaps of eateries to choose from. A lot of street music. I really loved wandering about and just taking it all in. I stopped for Mexican which was nice and fresh.
,,Small hip street,3.0,,Tiny lane similar to those in Europe where you can sit outside and enjoy the ambiance. It gets pretty hot sitting out there and the restaurants around are kind of mediocre. Still a cool vibe and some cool shops around though
,,Lovely colourful street,4.0,,I enjoyed Haji Lane. Very colourful and quaint. Some surprisingly good shops with great clothing. Well worth a wander down if you’re in the area.
,,Colorful neighborhood,4.0,,A nice hidden gem. Just a short walk filled with color and atmosphere. Restaurants and shops worth a visit.
,,Must see!,5.0,,"I HIGHLY recommend visiting Haji Lane during call to prayer. Listening to it is an unreal experience! Definitely visit nearby attractions like the Sultan’s Mosque and the Malay Museum! I was luckily able to visit Haji Lane during Ramadan and also got to experience the Ramadan bazaar that occurred nearby too. Haji Lane overall is a nice stop to visit on your way to Sultan’s Mosque and the Malay Museum. I’ve attached pictures of Haji Lane and the Sultan’s Mosque.

P.S. try to dress conservatively for the Mosque but they do have robes if you need it for free."
,,Hidden gem,5.0,,"We went to this place to fill in some time after seeing it mentioned in an Australian travel paper...what a gem. Very different to anything we had seen before. Not exactly Singapore culture as such, something very different but great fun to trawl the quaint shops and funky cafes. The next lane over is back to back fabric stores. Not sure how this would be in the rain though..we were there on a clear day."
,,Fascinating view of a different part of Singapore,4.0,,"A walk along Haji Lane provides a fascinating view of a part of Singapore that is probably more Bohemian and less well known even to locals. There are so many quaint shops to browse and buy from. Their wares are not the stuff you find in shops or departmental stores, but certainly you will find more than one souvenir to bring back with you, Its also another photogenic location, apart from Joo Chiat's peranakan houses. And the neighbouring area in Kampong Glam offers such a wide variety of food and drinks that it is a day well spent."
,,Vibrant street arts and shops,4.0,,"More of a tourist destination than for locals and filled with a spectrum of shops; from bars to desserts cafes to clothing shops.

Colourful artistic graffiti all around and beautiful decorations that make for many Instagram-worthy shots.

Recommend to go to Haji Lane on weekdays when it’s less crowded and to check the weather ahead of time. Haji Lane is mostly unsheltered hence it will be pretty hot outside. However, the shops are mostly air-conditioned which is a good respite from Singapore’s heat.

Many of the shops have narrow corridors and steep stairs hence may not be suitable for some. Though the main walkway is generally clear for ease of access, except for the small alleys.

One would be able to spend a couple of hours exploring the place if he/she/they chooses to."
,,"Quirky Street, great find",5.0,,"Haji Lane is a great area to shop around and get a nice lunch. There is interesting graffiti everywhere coupled with a hipster vibe that I really enjoyed. Be sure to do prior research for food ideas, because I ended up at a Turkish restaurant that took 90 minutes to serve our food."
,,"Haji Lane, Singapore",4.0,,A nostalgic past visit. Nicely rejuvenated to showcase the contribution of Arab traders to SIngapore's past. Nice little restaurants. Original fabric shops still there.
,,Welcome discovery,5.0,,The lady working on the shop when we visited on April 24 was so charming even though she was very busy. She kindly recommended a dress she thought would suit me and her expert eye was right! I bought the dress but could have spent even longer pottering about in the eclectic and creative shop. A welcome alternative to the high prices from Singapore shops. My husband also enjoyed browsing through the shop.
,,Fascinating street full of boutique shops,4.0,,"We read about this small street in an airline magazine and decided to see for ourselves. The street shops are very colorfully decorated. The shops are really boutique and are mostly clothing related. There are a number of pubs on one end of the street (only about two blocks long). It's worth a look-see for a good fifteen-minute walk (unless you see something you really ""have to have!"""
,,Colorful Life and Style,5.0,,"Good for photo shooting, fun walking and enjoy shopping but pls come a bit late afternoon as in the morning most of the shop closed but still lot of people come around and enjoy the modern and some old-fashion. But yes some small nice cafe open for some drink and breakfast. All the neighborhood is good to check-in also. Nice to see the combination of new and old. If you come in the evening you may meet all the bar and restaurants."
,,Lovely!,5.0,,This is a beautiful part of the city and well worth a visit. We went at night and at the restaurants were busy and lively. There was a music group singing outside one restaurant which added to the easygoing atmosphere. Lots to see.
,,Cute area,5.0,,Graffiti is not allowed in Singapore. The artwork is this area was really beautiful. Area is very quaint. I ended up in this area for at least 2 hours. A lot to see in this area.
,,Great place to check out trendy shops and restaurants,5.0,,"Located in the historic Kampong Glam sector of Singapore, easily accessible by MRT with Bugis station nearby, Haji Lane and the adjacent Arab Street are very worthy of your time. The very trendy boutique fashion, clever craft places, souvenir shops, cafes, restaurants and colourful painted buildings all add to the atmosphere of this place. It is popular destination with the nearby Sultan Mosque also worth a visit."
,,Culture everywhere,5.0,,"Went with a school study tour, a group of 70 families, lots to see, eat and wander around. Beautiful wall paintings and creative mastermind decorations are growing in this community everywhere, keep on going!!"
,,Cool place to visit,5.0,,When you’ve finished visiting the Mosque take a stroll down haji lane and check out the shops and cafes. Quite a hipster area.

,,Very nice and relaxing place to hang out,5.0,,"It's a nice place to chill and get drinks. If you come earlier in the afternoon, there are graffiti walls to take photos of as well! And it's a short walk from Bugis MRT. The shophouses there offer interesting items as well, hipster-ish things."

Many restaurants and quite a bit of live music spread along the lane. Great vibe. Would highly recommend Haji Lane for food, drinks and great music."
,,Artwork at haji lane is a must see.,4.0,,Do visit this place. the art work along this lane is beautiful. its a tiny lane near arab street so dont miss it out.
,,Must see Haji Lane!,5.0,,"This area of Singapore is not to be missed. Colorful buildings with tasteful grafitti, cool bars and retaurants, and unique boutiques line this street in the Arab quarter. Easily add this to a tour of Little India which is nearby for an interesting half day. The buildings are so unique-- picture opportunities everywhere you look."
,,Gentrified,3.0,,"This could be described as Singapore/KL/Penang/Malacca lite. Cleaner, more hip version of old British Straits Settlement."
,,Cool Place,5.0,,Lots of cool places selling vintage clothing and handmade jewellery and crafts. Some nice graffiti too as well as bars and restaurants. Worth a visit
,,Vibrant,5.0,,We went for lunch on a recommendation... exceeded our expectations! Colourful vibrant street lots of little individual shops and restaurants. Also coffee with your photo on top . Enjoy have fun!
,,So colorful,5.0,,This is where the art lover must go! It’s worth a visit as you will see all shops are decorated so colorful and very stunning graffiti.
,,may need a little navigating,3.0,,"if you took the train to get to the place, you might walk a few blocks to get to the place. google maps is a little confusing so do not be shy to ask people for direction. it is best to come here in the afternoon when the sun is about the set. there are a lot of pop art, botiques and stores but try not to splurge here. it is expensive for me. you can also buy cheaper food at bugis whick is a few bocks away.
remember, take picture, maybe have a little snack. no shopping :)"
,,"Graffiti walls, perfect for art lovers and Instagrammers",4.0,,"Colorful and quirky, take great OOTD shots against the walls. Best to go around 6pm, as you can catch light for photos, take advantage of happy hour deals and hang around until the live music sets up during the weekends."
,,Coloful!!!,5.0,,"I'm at the point where I appreciate colorful surroundings and art works. Alley by alley, it's so colorful and beautiful. After walking find the Milktea house calle ""Little Po"" and seat beside the color white bench beside the store. Wow, what a beautiful life."
,,Cute place!!,4.0,,"Recommend!! A interesting place, mixed with lots of different cushion restaurant, bar and people!! Just go!"
,,Pretty laneway,4.0,,Nice laneway to take a few photos and have a drink. Don't expect to get very much shopping done though. Most of the shops sell the same touristy junk. I picked up some nice enamel pins and jewellery at Hygge featuring Studio Ghibli characters which was a surprise!
,,UNIQUE,4.0,,First time coming to Haji Lane and found this place very nice. Beautiful paint. Many restaurant surround it. Take selfie a lot

,,Highly hipster West countries place,3.0,,"When you search for some art or when you want to have a beer in the international environmenst, this is a place. Count with touristic prices, though. Even if I didn't buy anything, it was nice to just walk and take pictures of interesting shops."
,,"Great Nightlife, Pubs, & Live Music!",5.0,,"Haji Lane is thee place to be in the evenings if you like street art, live street music, good drinks, good food, and a super lively area! It's located right next to a quieter business district, so it's not like you would expect, but wandering down a few of the roads here, you'll find everything you need! From Jazz clubs, to street bars with live music... Not to mention the hip street art on nearly every building adding a colorful vibe to this area.

PRO TIP: Take advantage of the Happy Hour beers around 5pm to save on athe already expensive drinks. Live music should start around that time as well."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Singapore Tourism tells us that Haji Lane is a popular shopping strip and whilst it does have a number of (seemingly) independent retailers and designers, it is very quickly apparent that this is more about instagram and selfies!

And it’s not hard to see why. Set in the Arab Quarter in Kampong Glam, this narrow laneway features colourful frontages on old shop fronts and murals on just about every wall.

Well worth a visit to the whole area, including Haji Lane."
,,Hipster,5.0,,"A great place to stroll, you’ll find many walls filled with art which are great as background for your instagram picture. I recommend about an hour of stroll to see all the alleys."
,,Quirky & offbeat hideout location in Singapore's concrete jungle,5.0,,"Haji lane was formerly known the Muslim Quarter due to the strong presence of Muslim community on the 50s and 60s. After the recent facelift gives to Haji lane, this place has transformed into a hipster's paradise. Located just 10 minutes walk from Bugis MRT station, there are many hipster cafes and stores in that street which are aesthetically pleasing. If you are into vintage pieces or frame, there are several shops for your needs. And for the avocado generations, there are plenty of picture stops and artistic murals for your Instagram posts!"
,,Amazing area!!,5.0,,"My favorite part of the city. Young people, nice shops, cool restaurants and bars. Very colorful and alive! Just walk some meters from Bugis station."
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,"Such a great place to visit, has really nice boutique shops, great bags, dresses, bit like Paddington in Sydney, My daughter bought a beautiful dress there, not expensive Really nice cafes too, one you can get a picture of yourself on your coffee,"
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,Funky shops and wall art; good little shops and a great cafe (I Am - see other review). The whole Arab quarter is a great half day trip.
,,Boutique shops for tourists and expats,3.0,,"I have mixed feelings about Haji Lane. While it's vibrant and lined with beautiful murals along its length, it's simply not a place worth visiting if you want to experience Singapore unless you wish to shop for overpriced knick-knacks or love generic gentrification.

You could alternatively explore Geylang Serai Market, a local food centre and market selling local Malaysian food and products."
,,very colorful and lively place to visit,4.0,,"If the weather is not so hot i would strongly recommend visiting this place. Very colorful , lots of small shops, restaurants and coffe places. Good place for having good selfies😊 I am sure you will not get bored"
,,Fun colourful lane full of energy,5.0,,"Haji Lane in the neighbourhood of Kampong Glam certainly is a place to visit in Singapore for its vibrant coloured walls, bars, cafes and trendy stores. The lane was energised on the evening of our visit, it was narrow, warm and humid, filled with people socialising over a drink or meal, it had such a friendly inviting atmosphere."
,,Great afternoon at Haji Lane,4.0,,"Getting there is easy. Drop at Bugis Junction MRT station and walk about 5 minutes.
There are plenty of small and cozy cafes along the small lane. Also shops selling clothes, bags, posters and souvenirs.
There are few nice wall mural to take pictures. This is a great place to hang out with friends for some nice coffees."
,,"Groovy shopping, bars, street art, and live music",5.0,,"Vibrant street covered in street art with groovy shops, bars, and restaurants. Highly recommend going in the late afternoon explore the stores before they close (around 8-9pm) but also get to see the live music scene start up at night. The restaurants in Haji lane have a good variety, or there are other great restaurants in the parallel streets too (vegetarian, vegan and gluten free options around). Stores are great for men, women, and kids - some clothing, some gadgets, some gift shops"
,,Got Duck-ed,4.0,,"I’m enjoy my visit at Hj Lane and it’s worth 450m walk from Bugis Station. You will pass a hospital and Park View Square, a well known place to take outdoor weeding photo shoot. A neighbourhood to Kampong Glam which Sultan Mosque and Restaurant ZamZam were located. Here in Hj Lane you’ll find art & colourful shop with affordable price. What’s makes me feel better is here got Malaysian “Prouduck”. A brand from Malaysia called Duck selling scarves, cosmetics and etc. Singapore’s muslim spa known as Moza Aesthetics owned by Baihakki Khaizan’s (Singapore National Footballer) spouse also located here. Overall a must visit place."

,,My Exploration of Haji Lane Singapore,5.0,,"The quirky and vibrant street of Haji Lane – Singapore’s hip and trendy neighbourhood! This long, narrow road is lined with fusion restaurants, eclectic shops, and unusual concept boutiques that are sure to tickle your fancy!"
,,Quaint & Colourful 🌈🌈🌈,4.0,,"A brief but very enjoyable visit to this quaint and colorful neighborhood just off Arab street and only a stroll from Bugis station.
The small lane (300m long) is littered with knickknack shops, women’s boutiques stocked with local designer brands, bars, pubs and Mexican eateries. Plenty of insta worthy photo ops - no filters needed!
Being one of the hip places to go to unfortunately prices reflect this but it’s well worth a visit if combined with Arab street or in our case Meomi cat cafe just around the corner (separately reviewed)."
,,Haji Lane,4.0,,If you’re looking for market style shopping and a relaxed atmosphere this is a great place to visit. The closest MRT stop is Bugis and it is about a 450m walk. There are plenty of bars which are a bit pricey because of the location.
,,Neat little street with a lot of art,4.0,,This is a neat little street with a lot of art and has a great vibe to it. We stooped off here on our tour of the city and strolled around for about a half hour. You may need more time if you want to eat here.
,,The kind of vibe I fancy,4.0,,"Haji Lane is a short, narrow street about 3 blocks long starting from Beach Road ending up to Victoria Street. The street is lined with unique shops, boutiques, cafes and restaurants. The vibe is very bohemian, artsy-fartsy, laid-back and casual. Just the type of place I look for when I travel. My group chose a Mexican-themed bar called Piedra Negra. There was an acoustic duo playing a couple of meters across the road which added a nice touch. The place comes alive and best visited during nighttime. It's festive mood can lift up your spirits while you consume your favored ""spirits"". Go try it out to see the more casual side of Singapore."
,,Neat little street,4.0,,This is a must walk through if you are in the area. It has some ok stores but if you walk along you can fins some cute boutiques. This was one of my favorite streets to walk through.
,,Haji Lane,5.0,,A very good experience. It’s a road full of different kinds of restaurants. You have restaurants where there are windows to a kitchen and you can see them cook your food. There is the selfie cafe that looked nice as well. A good experience.
,,Cool culture,5.0,,Great for looking for unique finds that is different from the mall . At night there is live music and great for chilling. A must visit place in sg .
,,Just ok,3.0,,"Many cafes that are good to take Instagram pictures but can be rather expensive.Many halal options if you are muslim.

Walls have graffiti art which is nice for pictures also.

Other shops are mostly selling clothes/shoes but are also expensive.If you want to shop for cheap stuff,go to Bugis Street instead."
,,"Great murals on colourful buildings, cute shops",3.0,,"What a great spot to take some shots, enjoy an icecream and explore the boutiques. Friendly people and some lovely hand made products. Not expensive either."
,,Nostalgic,4.0,,It’s been a long while since I visited this place. Always brings back the old Singapore feel. Interesting walk!
,,Great Grafitti to pose,5.0,,"I saw so many pictures about Haji Lane in my Instagram. So I decide to visit this area and see the place. I took MRT and drop off at Bugis Station. Then I walk to the area by google maps.

The place were full of great grafitti. And there are so many store and a cafe around the street. I suggest you to visit early around 9 a.m, because there are so many people visit that place too. And to take a picture in front of the grafitti that you want to , you have to wait."
,,Great area for exploring,5.0,,Super nice area for local food and nice cafe. Great for shopping as well with some boutique shops in the area. Worth to spend about an hour or two here while in subgapore. Easy access from bugis mrt station.
,,Graffiti & Murals,4.0,,It is a very vibrant and colourful street with lots of nice graffiti and murals. Definitely worth a visit as it is something different from the ever present sky scrappers of the country. Find a nice coffee shop and bask in the moment. It is pretty nice to chill here.
,,Cute shops and murals,4.0,,Cute street to walk down with shops and cafes. Colors of the buildings are bright and vibrant and there are beautiful murals as well. Different look and feel amongst the tall sky scrapers of downtown. Worth a visit!

,,A great place to spend an evening,5.0,,"This is a lovely street near Arab street with lots of little individual shops selling a variety of things, and several bars with Happy Hour from 3 pm to 8 pm. From about 7 pm there is live music in some of the bars and you can also get finger food all day. A lovely way to chill after a days' sightseeing"
,,A nice browse,4.0,,Good to browse the shops of haji Lane. Colourful cafes and shops. Also visit Arab street which is next to it
,,Well worth it,4.0,,"We walked here from Little India - a bit of a hike in the heat but manageable. We are really glad we made the effort, this was a hip and happening place at 5pm on a Friday afternoon.
Not all shops are colourful and painted with murals but inside they have a different feel to offer from much of the other shops in the area.
Great eclectic shops and the kids had a thrill at the selfie coffee shop."
,,The real action is on Arab street,1.0,,Haji lane is nothing but a few sad looking cafes. The cool shops with the beautiful Middle Eastern and Islamic lamps and carpets and such are all on Arab street. Arab street is one block from haji lane but more exciting. So do yourself a favor and skip Haji lane and go strait to Arab street.
,,Great to browse around,4.0,,"Lovely, interesting part of Singapore to spend a couple of hours wondering around, and grabbing a bite to eat."
,,Something different,5.0,,"Give yourself a few hours from the normal Singapore activities and shopping and visit Haji Lane. Great little laneway strip full of quirky shops and cafes.

Bought some nice souvenirs and clothes here."

,,Surprising mix of shops and cafes,4.0,,I wasn't sure about coming to this area of Singapore however I really enjoyed the mix of shops on offer. There was a good selection of shops selling a wide range of things. The surrounding area was interesting too with a mosque to visit and plenty of places to eat.
,,Antique Shop,4.0,,"If you want to find some antique and art shop, this is the right place. Lots of store of antiques here"
,,"Hip, cool and very pretty. Would highly recommend.",4.0,,"Lovely, cool, hip area. Pretty coloured lane. Great for vintage shopping but pricey. Nice cafes and bars to stop for a drink or food and chill. Live music in the evenings at some places. Would definitely recommend. It's a very tiny narrow street but long."
,,Nice place!!,4.0,,"The Haji lane is a small place but it give different feeling as there is an art, restaurant, bars and coffee shop. The shop is design with the color all over the street."

Would recommend visiting when in Singapore"

,,IG opportunities,4.0,,"One fine day me and my friend decided to do the touristy thingy in Singapore and the first place we hit was Haji Lane. I did not expect it to be so near the Queen Street bus terminal where we so often stopped. It is actually a narrow long lane with shops on both sides. At the beginning of the lanes we could see the how colourful the lane is. Every few steps taken would give good photo opportunities. There are shops selling clothes, bags, accessories, trinkets and other stuff i don't remember. There are cafes and pubs too. The pies at ""windowsill pies"" are yummy. Enjoy a pie with a cup of tea and watch the people walking by and posing for photos. With colourful walls, murals and interesting window displays, there just isn't any excuse not to have a shot taken. At the end of the lane there is restaurant serving prawn mee and from the crowd i guess it should be good"
,,Graffiti,4.0,,"Right at the entrance of Kampong Glam area. This tiny street is vary famous for the wall graffitis and the small middle eastern cafes. Whenever you are in the area take a few minutes of walk and take some nice pictures, very amusing."
,,STREET art,5.0,,"This is one of my favourite streets across Singapore. I love how it shows a wide array of art in just a short walk.
From it's quirky shops, restaurants, cafes to stunning street arts and different races of people from all over the world. It is very entertaining to just stroll and enjoy every bit of this lane. Even the old architecture is amazingly preserved. There are also a lot of inexpensive, clean hostels around. So it's quite an all-in-one place."
,,Vibrant streets of colour and atmosphere,5.0,,"One of my favourite areas to visit every time I'm in Singapore. Handy to get to with both Bugis and Rocher MRT stations close by. Haji Lane is part of the Arab District and is a photographer's dream. Lots of narrow streets, colourful murals, quirky shops and the stunning Sultan Mosque. You will also not go hungry with a vast range of cafes and restaurants to choose from."
,,Vibrant,4.0,,"We arrived at the Pan Pacific Serviced Suites on Beach Road on a Friday night which were located directly across from Haji Lane. We got there around 8pm and struggled to find a table, very popular restaurants/ bars / cafes, had live music at that time also. The food was good, only had nibblies the first night, calamari, chips, chicken wings but very tasty and reasonable priced. Mexican food was good and my partner was happy as the one on the corner had Southern Comfort, not always easy to find in Singapore. Staff in the area were friendly enough but service was quite slow, several times we ordered 2 drinks at a time as flagging someone down could take a while. The hotel did not serve breakfast on Sunday's and not much to choose from in the area but the Juice Bar in Haji Lane was tasty and good priced, served real bacon which was a pleasant surprise, again though service a little slow so not recommended if you are in a hurry."
,,"Haji Lane, Eclectic Singapore.",5.0,,"After experiencing the delights of the local food. Our next stop was Haji Lane. If Singapore were to get Hipster at all, this would be the place to visit! While it is Illegal to do any graffiti in Singapore, Haji Lane is a visual feast of Street Art.

Fabled for being one of the narrowest streets in Singapore, Haji Lane in Kampong Glam offers an unusual and eclectic mix of independent boutiques selling a great selection of clothes, accessories and even vintage cameras. This street in the Arab Quarter now stands out as one of the must-do shopping experiences for those on the lookout for extraordinary items.

The burst of colors, the row of perfectly lined stores made for Instagram photos, quirky boutiques, street art and really hip bars and cafes make this a far more interesting place to hang out compared to the more commercialised Orchard.
Haji Lane are usually packed on weekends. Makes it harder to get a selfie at one of the many murals that define the character of the area.

,,Unique in SG - unimpressive if you are from a real cosmopolitan metropolis,3.0,,"If I were a young SG kid, or not completely tired of the hipster movement, I would be less cynical.

Problem is I am old and have seen it all before. Selfie coffees and pet cafes? This is culture? Government sanctioned street art? Yoga studios and... what else? I can't think of it now, but I'm sure you can.

There is a high business turnover around Haji Lane. I don't just mean the customers coming and going, but the businesses. Is this because the businesses are just trend followers riding the zietgeist, yet never getting ahead of the game? Or because the businesses are pushing risky ideas with the comfort of government subsidised rent?

Perhaps this actually is local culture. Perhaps they are on top of things. How about that? As you walk through you may come to your own conclusion.

Etymological fact: Haji Lane gets its name from the times when Muslim pilgrims of SE Asia would arrive in Singapore to transit for their epic trip to Mecca. Singapore being a free port made it the obvious choice for travellers, hence creating a huge market for Islamic provisions (and accommodation) that were found in the shophouses which now sell faux art pictures of seemingly unrelated quotes and western celebrities."

The nearest MRT is Bugis station. The lane itself is a short walk away and definitely worth visiting. Visit in the late afternoon hours or in the evening where there is more movement."
,,Nice,3.0,,It was a nice experience to be here. The place is really good for pictures. There are a lot of paintings and places you could enjoy.
,,Cool lane with some great shops,4.0,,Very photo worthy stop in Singapore. Great little boutique shops selling a range of goods. Plenty of restaurants there also.
,,Great place for art-lovers,4.0,,"There's much to do, though it's just a lane. Photo-taking, shopping, dining and leisure walking...The wall paintings are eye-catching!"
,,A good short respite but expensive,3.0,,"This small lane is full of boutiques and small shops. As tourists we couldn't fancy anything particular here as things seem to be be too expensive for even Singapore standard. The eyewear Bolon shop we know was marking up their prices by 30% from elsewhere and, of course, didn't accept returns! Nonetheless, its a good place to window shop and see people. A few dining options are available as much as cafes. I imagine it offers a respite to Singaporeans, saving them long treks to options elsewhere in the city.

Arab street is adjacent but has an entirely different vibe to our New York eyes and ears. It seem to have Turkish bent that didn't seem authentic to someone who has been to Istanbul on numerous occasions and loves the place."
,,The most Instagram-worthy lane!,4.0,,"I came here solo and explored the street. The place has got great art work and is buzzing with a lot of eating joints and boutiques in the lane. Lovely place to discover new things.
I personally didn't really like the boutique collection and many seemed close."
,,Photo chances,4.0,,Haji lane is a small street near Arab Street. The graffiti on the wall is a perfect background for good photos. At night you can hang around many restaurants and bars.
,,Brilliantly Infectious,5.0,,"Haji Lane and the surrounding area is such a lively happening place. Very hip, very nostalgic feeling and vibrant. Every time i go there, it's like being in up market Morocco or Turkey. I refer to the area as little Arabia, there are lots or Arabic eateries, halal food etc. But some lovely bars too so it's such a diverse place also.

I love the street art and the boutique style shops. It's just a joy to be in. If you enjoy character, this is a must see."
,,Don't go too early. Most restaurants and bars don't open until late.,4.0,,"Don't go too early. Most restaurants and bars don't open until late. fun, trendy, place to get a drink and a bite to eat."
,,Didn't Feel like leaving this Place,5.0,,"Haji Lane is a must visit for an experience in itself . It has beautiful colourful shops and cafes all around. I wanted to try each and every cafe or at least a dozen :). You can reach here by alighting as Bugis MRT and its a 10 mins walk from there, ofcouse if you walk in the right direction. Try out the selfie coffee , its an experience and will give you memories to keep. Everywhere you will see beautiful graffiti on walls or some kind of art of the other. Keep walking and you will reach the Arab street which is connected to Haji Lane."
,,Small street with plenty of street art,4.0,,"A good place to visit. Evening could be a good time, as the temperature would be cooling off and you can also explore the nearby streets and eateries. This is a short street only for walking, with lot of street art and boutique shops on both sides. Very colorful, a paradise for photography enthusiasts, a fulfilling experience for anyone who enjoy a nice stroll and watching vacationers from all over the world. The Sultan mosque, Arab street etc are nearby, where thee is plenty of opportunities for shopping persian carpets, lamps from morocco, clothes from arabian countries and lot of international eateries."

There's a tiny 7-11 for quick refreshments as well as many cafes towards the southern end of Haji Lane."
,,Hipster haven - everything's IG-worthy!,5.0,,"Go here for chic local boutiques and vintage finds. Kinda like the Harajuku of SG: it’s a very eclectic, hipster neighborhood. Everything is IG-worthy: it’s covered in beautiful murals, and chock-full of quirky stuff for your home and closet.
Shops to check: Victoria Jomo (really good markdowns on branded stuff), Modparade (chic and feminine casualwear), Time After Time"
,,Favourite area in Singapore,5.0,,"This was my favourite area in Singapore. I love small bars, shops and street art. It's a great area to catch up with friends or just head along to have a few drinks. Find the perfect spot, order your drink & some food to pick at & watch the world go by. There are a lot of tourists stopping every 3 meters for the perfect photo op which is always fun to watch. Don't just stick to Haji lane, make sure you explore the streets around as the Arab quartet has a lot to see."
,,Quirky stores and street art in must see lane,5.0,,"Our family of four (Mum, Dad and kids aged 5 & 8) visited Haji Lane on a Sunday afternoon in June.

The Arab Quarter was a stones throw from where we were staying so on our first afternoon in Singapore we headed to Haji Lane as I'd heard about the quaint shops dotting the street.

We loved the street art, but at the same time the lane seemed really clean. Great selection of little shops, my kind of places selling quirky gifts or unique fashion.

We came across some turtles in a small tank on the sidewalk which were a hit with our kids!

Great place to visit along with Arab Street, Sultan Mosque and the rest of Kampong Glam."
,,Short and small street,3.0,,A little street which we just had a casual walk. Nothing too fancy or unique. Was recommended by a Singapore local but didn't have any dealings with the business though.

,,Quaint,4.0,,Probably the only place in singapore where graffiti is allowed. So walls are full of colourful images. Nice narrow lane with some nice architecture
,,Artistic and colourful,4.0,,"You can have a slow stroll down this street and admire the art on the walls and colourful houses. You can even browse what the shops have although I wouldn't recommend buying anything as I found it expensive like most other places in Singapore as it is an expensive country.

Behind is Arab street which is also quite quirky and artistic. You can eat there or walk to the mosque and the whole area in general is great for pics.

Don't shop in this area.. far to expensive and not worth it"

,,Can Be a Trip Back in Time .... Explorers and Traders,5.0,,"Living in Singapore as an expat, ""Little Arab"", as it is sometimes called, is a wonderful neighborhood is called is home to Haji Lane. The Sultan's mosque is the place of honor in this neighborhood, There are little boutiques, numerous eateries of every cuisine, Persian, Mediterranean, Halal, Malay, Chinese, Turkish, etc. My favorites are Al Turka,Zam Zam, and Blu Jaz. At any time, standing on a corner by the mosque, you can observe Arabs, Muslims, Malays, many locals, and tourists...it is like a walk in time when traders and explorers walked the streets enjoying the sights. Have a beverage at the Simple Kiwi and relax. Visit the mosque and learn about the Prophet and Islam as a religion of peace. You will be given a full poncho to wear over your clothes. Take it with grace and wear it with dignity inside the mosque. Men can enter the prayer hall and women can go upstairs. The mosque attendants are kind and friendly. Observe that the dome is encircled with rounded pieces of glass. We were told that when it was built, Coca Cola bottles were used. Use your telephoto and have a conversation tidbit!"

,,A good place to stroll,4.0,,"We took the Bugis Mrt exit B to reach this place. We then walked towards the Raffles Hospital. We knew we were at Haji Lane when we saw colorful baroque style houses selling trinkets and souvenirs. Next we headed to Masjid Mosque, in this area there are plenty of carpet, textile, silk scarf and aromatic stalls. At the end of the trail to the Mosque is a Malay Printing Museum. Tourist can get in for free. Just inquire at the Tourist Information Center.
Tired from walking, we got ourselves avocado gula melaka and teh tarik with pulled milk which was really, a relief to our thirsty body. Too bad we were not able to taste the Puto Piring , it was too early to cook a batch.
This is indeed a good place to stroll - be it early in the morning or late in the afternoon.
It is also a good place to dine at Persian and Turkish restaurants.
At the end of the day we were so happy to get ourselves nice fisherman's style hats and an indian silk scarf."

It's a small street, won't spend much time here unless u stay for the bars"
,,Mosque and street,4.0,,The two things worth seeing are the Sultan mosque and the streets close by. Really interesting culture and some good restaurants.
,,One of the coolest areas in the city,5.0,,"This street is a wonderful place to get away from the bustle. The Kampong Glam area has a grreat 'feel' and Haji Lane sums it up. Arty, relaxed, cool...the place to be (and not many tourists)!"

,,Taste of Arabia,5.0,,Beautiful place loads of chic small boutique and shops with lovely handcrafted Merchandise. My wife loved it bit on the expensive side but the area is very peaceful and it's lovely just to walk around. The Sultan Mosque is just beautiful and there are many different Middle Eastern restaurants around. We personally loved it a lot of fun.
,,Food & beer,5.0,,"Take a closer look to authentic street in Singapore. U will find food, beer, hand craft shops, live music..."
,,Vibrant Street,4.0,,"Narrow shophouse lined street with its own brand of vibrancy. A night pedestrian street, food and drink establishments on both sides. LIKES - Good Luck Beerhouse (craft beers) - Juice Clinic - live performances (till 1am on weekends)"
,,Haji Baji,3.0,,"All the rave I have heard about this place & the real thing was such a let down. Nothing special, just over priced shops & eateries & bars."
,,A gem in hidden part of Singapore,4.0,,"I was so excited to find this area unexpecedly. I found it when I saw from hotel window above, a small street that looked so alive with colourful lights at night. Then I decided to go there and.....ohhh I found it so amusing! Just walking along the area and I felt like I was not in Singapore! Small streets when people are hanging out, have a drink or dinner, beautiful paints and murals on the houses walls, and close to Haji Lane we can find Bali Lane, Arab street, Baghdad street, specialized with middle-east and Mediterranean restaurants... Not only pubs and restaurants, there are also some souvenir shops worth to see...
Such a gem in the hidden part of Singapore!"
,,Hip shops in classic shop houses,4.0,,Worth a walk to see the Singapore shop houses that once filled the city. These shop houses are now fun and quirky shops and eateries.
,,A very beautiful and accessible tourist point!,4.0,,"Haji Lane which is located in Arab Street is one of the famous tourist point in Singapore. In here, you will find several old building and shophouses with a very beautiful mural in front it and also in every wall corridor of the lane. This place also offered you so many great photo spots."
,,Interesting little shops and cool street art,5.0,,"I read some reviews on Trip Advisor that call this place a tourist trap, but I would definitely argue with this classification, especially in a place like Singapore where there are tons of obvious tourist traps (think Marina Bay Sands, Sentosa, Clarke Quay, etc.). In order to really enjoy the experience, explore the little shops and check out the local art. Take your time, stroll leisurely, and check out all the little art everywhere."
,,So so place,5.0,,"Was curious about this place, I came and when I found it is just a lane. Same other lanes with restos but there are some nice grafittis. But dont skip it as it is easy to find making your Sg visit legit hahaha!"
,,a street full of art,5.0,,A place to go especially for art enthusiasts. You'll find a lot of colorful huge art paintings on the walls. This place is where most of the Indians are.
,,"Great shopping, great bars, great atmosphere",4.0,,"A taste of old singapore. Well worth a look. Filled with loads of good food places, artisan ware shops, as well as eclectic local places to buy stuff to get shipped to your country of origin. Follow the footsteps of the people before you that are local that pick places to eat."
,,Nice Place To Walk Around - 值得一遊的好地方,4.0,,"Definitely, this is a good place to spend few hours. Historically, the 100+ years Sultan's Mosque is right in the corner & the Haji Lane itself is old enough to tell stories. When it comes to shopping, it has quite a few fun shops that sell cloth, handy crafts, designed staffs and quite varieties of choices. It has cookies house, cafe, beer houses and themed restaurants for us to explore for the gourmet tour. Location-wise it is easy to come by subway blue line system at Bugis station. Also, its colorful & ancient style buildings really make you take many photos.
算是新加坡很值得來個兩三小時一遊的地方；歷史上，就在他旁邊的蘇丹清真寺已經一百多年，加上他自己的也老的有很多故事可以訴說，這裡有不少值得一逛的小店，衣服、首飾、設計小品等等，這裡也有餅乾店、咖啡店、啤酒屋和不少主題餐廳可供選擇，氣氛也都很好，地點很方便，乘藍線到Bugis走過來只要幾分鐘，而他色彩繽紛的房子一定讓你拍不少照片。"
,,"Hipster place, all the hype",3.0,,"Visited to photograph some of the streetart and graffiti, had a lovely time, but the weather was fairly hot. There were many cafes, pubs and restaurants with few halal options, so it was alright. It's easy to get to from the MRT. There's a large selection of textile and souvenir shops, too as its pretty much next to Arab Street. There's quite a lot of walking and considering the weather, wear comfortable shoes and grab enough water!"
,,Eclectic Shopping and Bars,5.0,,"Eclectic, Hipster, Vintage shopping in a small narrow street near Arab Street and Bugis MRT. A must see if you are a little tired of Orchard Road/Designer shopping and looking for something off the beaten track. Look out for some good bars and restaurants popping up in the area. Constantly changing shops and bars keep this area interesting!"
,,Fantastic,4.0,,"A gem we did not know existed. You hear a lot about Arab St, this is nearby and very interesting. We were there early and not everything was open. Had one of the best haircut at a salon called Picasso."
,,Tourist hell?,2.0,,"Haji Lane is a very touristy little street full of souvenir shops, tourist restaurants, tourist bars and tourists. Though the area is picturesque it lacks any authenticity and seems to be Singapore's version of the standard international tourist trap (and is accordingly overpriced)."
,,Photo trick,3.0,,"Place is not that attractive but you can take a nice shot using your skills in photography.
A place to shop and dine although we went there for a walk and to take some photos only.
Be careful when walking as there are cars passing by"
,,Not worth the hype,3.0,,"Haji Lane was on my list of things I must do in Singapore after seeing it on 2 travel shows. What they don't show is the filth on the streets, the lack of diverse shops (all the same thing) and the unfriendliness towards tourists. To be fair - I am an easy going person and it takes a lot to upset me - but I found the atmosphere not what it could be. Still worth the visit though"
,,Where did all those great photos come from?,3.0,,First day in Singapore and in order to get over a long flight we decided on a 10 minute stroll from Raffles Hotel to Haji Lane. I had spotted many great photos on google so had camera on hand. Whilst I got some good photos the street does disappoint. A great atmosphere though and some good eating places.
,,Nice building,2.0,,I just visited this street for a while The building and resto was unique design Crowded place with many turkish people.. indian and maybe arab also.. so lil bit uncomfortable for me But good to see it
,,Lots of culture and colorful scenes,4.0,,"Nearby Arab street, you get a lot of colorful sights and sounds here at Haji Lane. Lots of restaurants and funky shops where you can find trinkets and items where you can't find anywhere else. The street art is amazing too."

,,Lovely!,5.0,,"I come here alot for photoshoots and I find it to be a very intresting place, there is so much to see and the food is great. It is a perfect place to just visit and look around. I would recomend this for lazy weekend activity, to just look around and eat. Have fun!"
,,"Cute little lane, shopping and walking around!",4.0,,It is a not very big street but it is lovely to walk around. It was during CNY so there was a few shops closed but there is still plenty to see. We walked around to Arub Rd as well which is next street up where there is more stronger culture and food scenes. Some boutiques are upstairs as well so make sure you visit them. There is also a few places to eat and drink and some street arts at the end of the street.
,,Quaint shophouses,4.0,,"Sited in the historic Arab street quarters, it was a major trading hub in its olden days. The old shophouses are conserved (the government got this one right finally!), and conveyed a sense of freedom and lost time with its many quaint looking shops and pubs. It is not a huge place and you can easily cover it in an hour or so, but the many little shops with its colorful aparels and accessories beckons one to approach (for ladies!). The pubs provide a restful place and there are actually quite a number of quirky cafes and eating places to explore. You can find many intricate fashion accessories and even cute household ornaments for decorations! Good for instagram and photography!"
,,Instagramable!,3.0,,Just about 10 minutes from Bugis MRT station and street full of cafe and mural art. Nice place to take a photo and recommended time to visit at 8-9 am.
,,Insta-perfect!,5.0,,"An absolute heaven for lovers of street art, quirky boutiques and tasty food. It's only a little street but it has a lot to offer."
,,Eating out in Haji Lane,4.0,,"On a recent visit too Kampong Glam, my husband and I set out to find a restaurant that we had eaten at many years ago. We found one in Arab lane and one in Haji Lane and were not disappointed. We ate Messe plates and a variety of other plates including Falafels and donner kebabs. You can't go wrong choosing any restaurant in this area as they are all buzzing with people. Very fresh home made dips, the only problem was that were practically rolled out the doors."
,,Vibrant street scene,5.0,,"Funky shops, restaurants and wall art are the main attractions of this street. Well worth a visit and a wander."
,,Nice streets to explore interesting shops,4.0,,Nice streets to explore interesting shops. Mostly small shops with interesting items. Many small designer shops worth checking out.
,,Sweet little place to visit. Boutique type shops,4.0,,We visited this area with our teenage daughter and we enjoyed that it was different to other areas we visited. The smaller stores were more boutique and a little different and quirky. Lots of little places to eat and drink. We would visit again.
,,"Pleasant boutiques, nice for a walk and refreshments",4.0,,"Can recommend Haji Lane for unique boutiques with the emphasis on beautiful things. Reasonably priced but not cheap, leather shops, unique jewellers, original and ethnic shops. A nice way to spend an hour or two browsing and enjoying a coffee bar or restaurant.
A very pretty backdrop of palm trees, original small buildings contrasting against high rise commercial modernity."
,,Love,4.0,,Stunning atmosphere with beautiful music. Very quirky vibe with quaint spots/establishments to sit and have a drink. Even have a selfie coffee
,,Super fun and quirky street,5.0,,Great little street with fun bars and great shops. Stop by the The Good Luck Beer bar for some local brews. We met tons of great people from around the world wandering the street and shopped for 2 hours.
,,Trip to Haja Lane,4.0,,"My daughter told me to visit Haja Lane. She said it was an arty, quirky place & that I would love it. She was right. Haja lane is full of funky cafes & interesting shops. I bought some earrings from a shop called alternative art. I also visited a shop that had just opened called The Silver Triangle. its run by a man who sells jewellery & Christmas Decorations from Lagos. The shop was so new that he could only take cash. I'm sure it will be a great success. We had a cold fruit juice at the jus juice cafe. It's a very quirky cafe painted in bright colours & bold patterns. It's a great place & next time I'm in Singapore I'll visit again."

,,My favorite Street in Singapore,5.0,,"This street is a MUST-SEE. Do not skip this part, when in Singapore. Haji Lane is iconic for it's little shop houses and artsy flair. I ALWAYS drop by here when coming back because I love the clothes, shoes, jewellery and little goodies and gifts you can find here. When done shopping, stay for a bit longer (or come back at night) to visit Going OM, a little cafe/bar that usually offers live music at night. I simply love the atmosphere and staff is also friendly and attentive. Cocktails are great. Also: Do try the desserts!"
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,"I always enjoy wandering down haji lane. Always something interesting to see the - the art, friendly traders and nice cafes and resteraunts."
,,"Fun, slightly funky but over-rated",3.0,,"Haji lane is known for being the 'indie' part of Singapore and there are quite a few good bars, cafes and boutique shops. It can get very crowded on weekends and most places tend to be over-priced. It is still fun to go to Haji Lane occasionally, but there are more and more places springing up around Singapore that are just as 'indie' or alternative, so Haji Lane is looking less so :-)"
,,"Worth a stroll, good for photos",4.0,,My husband and I took a stroll here after friends recommended it. Its a lovely street with brightly coloured properties. Its worth the walk to as its very different to the rest of the city. Places to eat and drink are plentiful and the MRT is close by.
,,Fun Street,4.0,,Great place to stroll once you've been to Arab Street. Tons of food options and some really neat little stores.
,,Worth a wander,4.0,,"Lanes of well renovated homes and fabric businesses. The mosque is always active with followers coming and going from prayers. Restaurants and bars (yes, bars) spread though this texile shopping area."
,,Not a huge amount there,3.0,,"There's really nothing hugely special about Haji lane. Theres a few shops (including a small 7/11), a few bars etc. It's a good place to visit for a few quick photos, visit a specific shop, or to have a drink with a friend or two at night."
,,Hip retail stores,4.0,,"This lane in the neighbourhood of Arab Street is filled with hip retail shops and boutiques, cool cafes and graffiti on the walls. Come in the evening and window shop or wander around taking in the sights and sounds of the area."
,,Good for a short afternoon walk,4.0,,"Haji Lane is actually really short and narrow lane with only few open biz, where you can find interesting souvenir e.g. hand-made leather accessories, boutiques, and a few places serving beer/coffee.
Suggest visiting in a laid-back afternoon time.
-Note:
Sudden heavy rain in afternoon time in Singapore that you may need to bring a umbrella."
,,Quirky lane next to more brash Arab Street,4.0,,"Had a fun time exploring the shops and cafes of Haji Lane, after we had wandered down Arab Street. There are quirky little clothes stores, tasty cafes and some interesting graffiti. Wander the neighbouring streets as well."

,,Totally cool place with fun and funky boutiques,5.0,,"Haji Lane is one block away from the fabric, textiles and carpet blocks of Arab Street. But so different!! The awesome boutiques, hair salons, cafes and culture are not to be missed. Unique and one of a kind things to be found."

,,Funky hip laneways,5.0,,I love this place. What a hip and funky vibe. The Malay Arab fushion and quirky boutiques are the best. The vibrant street art just adds to the vibe here. Make sure you allow a few hours to explore all the boutiques as they are a treasure trove. Then spend some time having a drink at one of the bars to truely soak up the vibe.
,,Waste,1.0,,"I read the reviews before going there, saw many people enjoying the place. So I decided to make a visit. It's very easy to get there but there really is nothing about this place I found interesting.

It was a waste of time and effort.

And the street art?
There are only a few of them. Very disappointing."
,,Really worth a visit,4.0,,"You'll find charming shophouses, cafes, restaurants and some incredibly beautiful street art in Haji Lane. The perfect place to meander and admire the clash of cultures in Singapore. We hadn't planned to visit this area, but so glad we stumbled across it!"
,,Here! Here!,4.0,,"Hajji Lane in Singapore is where you can find shophouses, fashion boutiques, bars and restaurants. If your gastronomical cravings are Middle eastern cuisine, Hajji lane is the place to go."
,,Worth a Visit,4.0,,Have to come here when the sun is setting. Great place for arts and nic nacs. Some nice eateries and sure a good place for happy hour hangout away from those in Clarke and Boat Quays...Should combine this visit together with Arab street as they are practically next to each other...
,,Really charming.,5.0,,"A really charming street with restaurants, pubs and small stores. Graffiti on the walls and the atmosphere is great."

,,'she type' place ...,4.0,,"SHE was very existing about this area as because this is a place for female shopping. We reached here early morning & wanted to be the 1st customer of a shop on that day (boni customer).

Very colorful shops full of woman cloths, dress of various design & fabric types, ornaments.

And the food shops though they are a little bit costly. We wished to try the ‘selfie coffee’ shop, but didn’t able to find it  Then we tried the Kebab house.
Many Malaysian shop keepers helped us to try their products; but they always stay at their fixed price.

May be we have to visit again & again this are for HER interest

,,A real blend of cultures,5.0,,"The lane is situated in the Muslim part of Singapore, but has a really great blend of modern and old. There was street art, edgy clothing shops and cafes just around the corner from the Sultan Mosque and other interesting streets and shops. This area provides a unique Muslim area to add to the multicultural feel of Singapore."
,,Do your own photoshoot here,5.0,,"I enjoyed my Haji Lane experience, it's not much hard to find because it's right at the heart of the city. Here you can be a model for a day as you pose in front of different graffiti walls. I even saw pre-nuptial photoshoot being done here. Haji lane is actually a collection of arts and crafts shops so you might check them as you walk along. The good find there that I can remember is the Art Shop with laminated art designs on their walls in the middle of the stretch, I just can't figure it out how I will bring the goods home so I decided not to take them. It's the first time I encounter such an art shop. Overall, Haji Lane is a must do after the major attractions. It's a good combo with visits in different art and historical museums which sadly I have missed in doing as that day was a National Holiday and museums were closed."
,,Highlight of my trip,5.0,,"So glad I came to Haji Lane. All the shopping Centres are the same, same brands, same layout, same, same, same. If you want somethig a little bit different in Singapore go to Haji Lane. The street art is cool, little cafes etc are good and the shops are quirky, boutique. I especially likes Modparade and Closed on Mondays ( yes that is the name of the store and yes as the name has it they are closed on Mondays). Haji Lane is also waling distance from Arab St and the mosque. Grab place to just wander around and explore."
,,More Happening Late Afternoon to Night,4.0,,"I've usually passed by Haji Lane during the early morning on my way to the MTR from my hostel, but this time, I got to go late afternoon and there's so much more happening around that time. As usual, I enjoyed the street art, plus the little unique and chic shops around the street. I wish I had more time to explore each shop, but unfortunately, this trip was another one of those short ones. Will have to visit again one time and spend more time exploring them."
,,Lovely little area - will return at night,4.0,,"This little area of Singapore is quite lovely and once you are here all the streets that run through to Arab St and the large impressive gold domed mosque are worth looking at too. Quaint little shops, hipster bars - relatively quiet in the daytime. My husband and I promised ourselves a return at nightfall next trip to Singapore."
,,Nice to wander round,4.0,,Found this short lane when wandering around. Street art is good and the area is quite quirky with nice shops and places to have a coffee etc - definitely worth a small detour and very close to the sultan mosque so easy to combine
,,"A great street for food, bars and shops",4.0,,A great street for food and bars and shops. We ate at the mexican restaurant and went for drinks in a bar nearby with live music.
,,Chic hangout area,4.0,,"Lots of cute standalone boutiques which carry both quirky, new and even vintage stuff in them. A great way to spend the day either window shopping or actually shopping!

Lots of cafes around the area with a great variety in the cuisine and caters to a variety of budget levels!

Do look out for the cat cafe! And also a nail saloon which employs underprivileged women!"
,,Quaint and lovely shopping,5.0,,A very picturesque and quaint Street that is a brilliant hide away from the city. The shopping is brilliant and the small cafes offer great food.
,,Haji Lane shopping and site seeing trip,4.0,,Loved the cultural experience and food stalls nearby - amazing ! Definittely recommend this in your Singapore trip !!
,,Such a hidden treasure trove of forgotten treasures,4.0,,"Haji Lane, is a must when visiting the Arab Quarter in Singapore, set back one street from the Mosque, this hidden treasure of stores, restaurants and pub (also the home of the selfie Cafe), but be warned don't go before noon as many shops are closed."
,,"Nice for photo shoots, choice selection of goods, trendy stuff",5.0,,"Haji Lane is just one small long street where old houses were leased to shop owners with the old upper floor facades kept intact and painted in attractive colors. Great array of shops. Trendy/fashionable/not-so-common stuff can be found here. Some great hair salons, eateries, and pubs too. We spent a whole afternoon browsing, buying some bags, sandals, and a snack."
,,It's an art. 😍,5.0,,"It's a hidden beauty spot located somewhere in Bugis. If your that type of person who are into graffiti then this place is perfect for you. The thing is, these wall paintings are located far from each other so prepare to get lost while wandering around this scenic place.

Pictures are taken around Arab street and Haji Lane."
,,Off to Mecca,3.0,,"Haji Lane is a small and insignificant street in Kampong Glam, the Malay Quarter, to the north west of modern Singapore City.

Its significance is that it is from here that devote Muslims set off on their journey to Mecca - the Haj.

We had just visited the Sultan Mosque nearby, and while we were allowed into the grounds of the mosque we could not go inside because everyone was busy in purification rites and prayers for their imminent Haj."
,,Good coffe,4.0,,"Cool shops, quirky and different from all the generic confusing super malls. Easy fun, it's not clean and sterile, it's fun and authentic. Loved CAM coffee, great vibe and cool owner. Lots of original shops. Seems to have changed from Arabic street style markets but such is the sad way of tourism some times. Still it's different and a fun side to Singapore."
,,Interesting,5.0,,It's an narrow street with restaurant on both sides. It's a lot lively with people and music in night. It has an interesting and appealing architecture and decor!
,,Beautiful Murals,4.0,,The section of the murals is quite small but well done. The restaurants are clean and delicious. Stop for a coffee and wind down.
,,"quaint buildings, cafes and a lovely walk",4.0,,"haji lane is of the nicest places in Singapore to walk about and just chill. there are lots of boutiques on the second levels mostly - it's good exercise - and some really unique shops and cafes to get coffee and cake when you are tired. on the whole, this is great place to come with friends, on a date or just on your own. there is a shop which has a very adorable pug. convenient to get to by train - just a short walk from Bugis."
,,Great Art Deco,5.0,,Another one of Singapore's best kept secrets. Well worth a walk around or stopping at one of the bars. Some interesting characters in the area.
,,Down the memory lane street Photostop,4.0,,Unique street just off bugis junction with small boutique shops and nice eateries. Definitely worth a visit and is a good photostop!
,,Shop the more authentic Singapore,5.0,,"Get out of the malls and spend a gorgeous couple of hours exploring the old shop-houses down Haji Lane. Lots of boutique, vintage and hard to find little gems on this street! I will definitely be back next time I am in Singapore, I found an awesome little boutique with great jewellery pieces and handmade genuine leather handbags at a great price! I picked up a gorgeous bag for $89."
,,Dont waste your time visiting here,1.0,,"We saw lovely photos on the web but when we got there it was scruffy and awful.
The murals were at one end and were about 10m long. There had been others in the past but they had crumbled off and not repaired.
There were rubbish bins all over the place and trash on the ground.
The smell goes with the rubbish bins too."
,,More Personality Than Mainstream Singapore,4.0,,"It's easy to get trappped in the 'mall vortex' that is shopping in Singapore, so an hour browsing the more independent stores along Haji Lane, topped off with a refreshment stop from the many available would be a good way to get off the beaten track. It'd be great to see this area develop into a truly independent, hipster area - there's some interesting retail and design going on, and still some 'made in china' imports too. It's obviously a hit with visiting Japanese and Korean women who love the jewellery and trinkets and selfie opportunities with the street art."
,,Turkish food and jazz!!!,4.0,,One of the best places in sg if like to have a lazy relaxed evening with your friends. Too bad the good old seesha bars are closed now.. But still got some amazing Turkish food and bars to hangout..must try in Singapore!
,,Mural,4.0,,Many cafe in that area. Mural is ok. The shop unique and colourfull but price is expensive. Better to location after 02.00 PM.
,,Shopping for gifts to take home,4.0,,Street has a wide variety of shops. Several good coffee shops. Bergs Burgers is a good lunch spot. Take your time an stroll the street. Very busy on the weekends as busses drop people off. Less crowded during the week and mid afternoon.
,,Good for a walk,4.0,,Good for a walk. Lots of shops selling similar vintage items and repeats after a few shops. Visit nearby Arab Street and the Sultan Mosque on the top of Arab Street. Nearest MRT station (Bugis) is around a 15minutes walk away.
,,Alot of spots to take a selfies,3.0,,"If you loves to take a selfies, please come to visit this place. You'll love it and spend alot of time here. A lot of wall that full of gravity that can spice up your pictures"
,,Disappointed visit to Haji Lane,3.0,,"After reading a lot of websites and reviews on Haji Lane, we were disappointed. The street, the idea of quirky/indie shops and getting away from big malls really appealed to us but my teenage daughter and I found the shops to be pretty much all the same - overpriced 'vintage' decorated in a fake retro style (looked like a Typo fit out). It seemed like all the stores could have been owned by the same owner/company. The few cafes and bars didn't appeal either."
,,good for a quick walk,4.0,,Lots of funky hipster shops good for a quick browse and a few unique items to take home to the family
,,A nice laneway in kampong glam,4.0,,"Pop down Haji lane when in the neighbourhood, lots of little boutique shops and a hipster attitude. It is pretty and a nice laneway near the Sultan Mosque. The street art is pretty cool"
,,Lots of do,4.0,,"Worth an afternoon visit to browse the shops, sights and various restaurants that are here. Not far from bugis mrt station."
,,"For coffee, food, and art lovers",4.0,,"A 5 min walk from Bugis MRT station will land you in the Arab St district - an area full of niche cafes, restaurants, and bars. Within the district are a series of thriving laneways (Haji Ln etc.) full of colour, energy, and street art. Come here to have great coffee, take photos, or to see a less commercial side of Singapore. Prices are generally mid range."
,,Interesting little street,3.0,,I arrived at Haji Lane just after midday on a Sunday. It was pretty quiet but full of photographic opportunities. Seems the bars and coffee shops crank up a little later in the day. I enjoyed the looking but loved the shopping on Arab street much more.
,,Small but Interesting,5.0,,Haji Lane is a cute little street that you walk down. It has unique shops and coffee shops. There are paintings on some of the walls. It's really a pleasant area and has a hip feel to it. If you're visiting Arab Street then you should definitely walk down Haji Lane. This isn't a must do in Singapore but if you're in the area or have an extended stay then you should go. I would recommend going in the evening. This is a backpacker area so it has a younger feel to it because of that.
,,"Lively, buzzing street in the Arab Quarter",4.0,,"Eclectic shops, lots of street art, cafes and bars of all varieties. Worth a visit. Easy to get to on the MRT.."
,,Awesome Street Art,5.0,,"go here for the graffiti alone!! The amount of bars and restaurants here were amazing. It’s such a lively place. We only went at night for food and a few things were shut, would have liked to have gone through the day to see more shops. They have a café where they take your photo and put it on top of your coffee, there is a bar where you just tell them what flavours you like and they will bring you a cocktail."
,,One of the best streets in Singapore.,5.0,,"Some great shops to browse, food, clothes and a myriad of other things. Lazy cats laying in the sun set the tone."
,,Of no great interest!,3.0,,"Haji Lane is one of those places that's been refurbished around the tourist market and dollar. At one end, there is some great street art, there are a couple of okay cafes and then a lot of shops designed to extract money from visitors. Potentially a place with great atmosphere, Haji Lane has little to offer."
,,Colourful Street Painting,4.0,,"A walk down Haji Lane will see many street wall paintings. No vehicle passable into this lane.

A quiet lane in the day, a pubbing entertainment place at night. There are many cafes, pubs, restaurants.

Enjoyed a leisure stroll on this lane to take pictures of the street painting.

Enjoyed. An hour to complete exploring."
,,Great place to chill and relax,4.0,,"A small lane with night life of bars and live bands, together with some design shops. A great place to relax and chill out with friends!"
,,Super little street,4.0,,"Happened on here as had a nail appointment (Nail Social), what a wonderful part of town. Beautiful little street with some nice boutique shops and great places to stop and eat or drink. Definitely worth spending an hour or two here people watching and taking in the atmosphere."
,,Nice shopping and dining,4.0,,"Haji Lane was directly opposite our accommodation at the Pan Pacific Serviced Apartments so hence we spent quite a bit of time here, as we also walked this way to get to the nearby Bugis MRT station. It is a great place to spend some money (lots of small independent stores), have lunch/dinner/coffee and people watch. There is also some street art/graffiti which makes for good pics. Wander around the surrounding lanes for all sorts of cuisine. Couple of blocks over is the mosque."
,,Really like haji lane,4.0,,"This place is simply great! Been in Singapore a while and I always seem to gravitate towards haji lane. You are waking around the Arab quarter, and you turn the corner and you are in the centre of nightlife! Just great and sums up Singapore!"
,,Best shopping!,5.0,,"Haji lane is full of super cute stores with clothes, jewellery, leather bags, shoes and more! All a bit different to mainstream, you'll find lots of awesome boutique style items from local designers."
,,"Street art, Cafe, and Shops",4.0,,"This place reminds me of Georgetown, Penang where you go to one street to find many nice restos/cafes and bars with also nice grafitti/street art along the way. Some people (me included) took pics of one of the famous spots in this street. You can go shopping there if you want too since there are lots of small shops sell souvenirs, accessories, clothes, etc"
,,Not a fan of Malls - Go Haji Lane instead,5.0,,"I am not a big fan of big malls and shopping centers and often this is a thing you cannot avoid in Singapore when you want to buy something. When i came to SG the first time in 2012 i did some research on blogs where you can find small boutiques to buy special gifts etc and stumbled upon Haji Lane where also those bloggers often have tiny shops selling their items. Surrounded with also great restaurants, this place I think is an Oasis in often so big and mall overcrowded Singapore. I absolutely can recommend Piedra Negra if you wanna munch down some really authentic Guacamole (rest of the menu is not so great) and for chilling outside on a warm evening Blue Jazz Cafe! Around there is even a cat cafe (yes, you go there and can pet some kitties while having a cuppa) and around Arab street there are great places to go for Falafel/Middle Eastern food. Start exploring :-)"
,,Shops and food,4.0,,"Haji Lane takes its name from the area being the epicenter of the Malay/Muslim community back in the 1800s, and thus was home to the businesses that facilitated the Hajj. The area is still focused on the Sultan Mosque.

The shops on Haji Lane are a mix of boutiques, some fabric shops, and some specialty stores.

Restaurants in the area are a mixed bag. If you're in the mood for some decent Turkish food try Derwish one street over on Bussorah St."
,,Complete Place for Finding Unique Things,3.0,,"There's a hundred shops that you can found here which is sell something unique. Such as an accessories, photo property, limited-design tshirt, room display, etc. You can reach haji lane by MRT to Nicoll Highway Station and walk 300m to Beach Road .."
,,Charming and colourful,5.0,,I had my wedding pictures taken here - love the rustic charm and colourful murals and architecture. This is the retro side of Singapore
,,Nice place for a beer,4.0,,"Went to blue jazz bar with my hubby, draft beer was cold and nice and pita bread was delicious! It was busy on Thursday night, nice place for a beer."
,,middle eastern zest worth the visit,3.0,,"Its an area dominated by renovated shop houses but this does show a different side of what different nationalities can contribute to a country. there is arts, crafts, cafes, food and of course its skyline in dominated by a mosque. this area of singapore has a good feel and vibe, if you have the time go during the day and again at night."
,,Good for phote,4.0,,"it is a street, no more like gang with highly art touch of it! Great for photo's haha I suggest you come at daylight"
,,Cool place,4.0,,"Cool place with cute terraces, cafes, street art and funky shops. Worth cruising if you're in the area."
,,Glam little corner of Singapore,4.0,,The trendy neighbourhood of Haji Lane and its hidden gems. Contains loads of attractions for those who love all things pretty. Check out Bar Stories and get them to prepare you a customised cocktail.
,,Such cool place,4.0,,So many great photos to be taken here lots of cool little shops to visit and some cool bars worth the visit go have a look the area
,,Atmosphere,5.0,,Great place to hang and shop near Arab street. Art atmosphere with its old shophouses and murals on them
,,Art work with art people,5.0,,It is located near to Arab Street with all artworks on the wall of building in the street. There are some cool shops and restaurant & bars here as well. Some people like to take the pictures here same like me.
,,"I loved it, quirky and fun with a young hip feel.",5.0,,"Very fun little section of Singapore. Not your typical street. It has a lot of fun, quirky little stores so make sure you go throughout the day when everything is open. Lots of little cafes and bars however i never ventured into any of them....More"
,,What a contrast to SIngapore,5.0,,"Haji Lane stands at the edge of the city being just a short way from Bugis MRT. Its a super cool place with a lovely chilled out vibe, packed with small quirky boutique shops and eateries. Haji Lane is a must go place around late...More"
,,Youth street fashion,3.0,,"A different kind of Singapore. Youth fashion. They used to have great shisha on oriental carpets on the ground, but they are gone."
,,Street with gravity and colorful,4.0,,"This street near Arab st. Around Kp. Glam with many building -store and restaurant- which is so beautiful color.

,,"Cool, lively and retro mixture of shops and cafes",4.0,,It's great to see this lane thriving and its surrounding streets retain its rustic charm and heritage.

,,Old,4.0,,This is a small street different to others.The buildings are older but very well maintained.Like other areas here they have lots of food outlets .
,,Fun shopping street in colorful district,3.0,,"This small street is lined with colorful shophouses, a traditional building type in Singapore. There are several good places to wander in and out of, coffee houses, clothing shops, knock knack shops. It's fun, relaxing and pretty unique. Right next to Arab Street where there is a beautiful mosque and fabric and rug shops. Fun to stroll in this area and take pictures. It's not in the top 10 things to do in Singapore on Trip Advisor but I thought it was a nice surprise and definitely a neighborhood i would return to."
,,Something different,4.0,,"The lane has many different shops, some have the same kind of things for sale but they are different from the many department stores and you can pick up some nifty gifts and items for yourself. Most a reasonably priced, some are a little pricey but you have to look! One of the shops has two cats in resident. One is very shy and the other is very outgoing and naughty! The shopowners were all very pleasant and welcoming."
,,Careful taking pictures,4.0,,"The place mostly has a nice feel to it, there are loads of quirky little shops (not all Arabic themed necessarily) to have a browse around. Visually it captures the imagination with interesting street art and cosy looking buildings. A pointer though, some places won't let you take pictures (never understood this). Tried to take one in a shop called Chic Fever because I felt like spreading the word about some of their genuinely interesting vintage items, and despite there being no staff around, an announcement was made over the PA to put my phone away. This was highly disturbing, it was not unlike something you'd expect in a North Korea or 1930's Germany, so be warned! Very creepy and unpleasant. Apart from that, the lane itself is worth seeing for a bit of culture, and it is small enough to do as part of a larger day out in Singapore."
,,Hip place,4.0,,"My companion wanted to see Haji Lane so this was first on our list. It's kind of hard to find for first timers like us since we got the wrong direction. Haha! Anyway, you can do shopping here but the items are a bit expensive. Take photos with street arts or have a drink or two at night."
,,Quirky shops and cafes,5.0,,"We loved this little lane full of street art. Great shops for unique souvenirs, home wears and clothing. Cute cafes, bars and restaurants. Add to your shopping and eating list in Singapore. Very Funky."
,,A very pretty place,5.0,,"There are some cafes, boutiqes, and store with beautiful art on their building. Bring your camera and take a lot of photo here. I am willing to spare my time to went here because this place is so alive and young, very nice for young people."
,,Not to be missed - little boutiques with unusual gifts,4.0,,"This is an alleyway with an eclectic collection of shops, selling anything from hipster bicycles to fancy notepaper to locally-made apparels. The fun is the discovery of interesting knick-knacks, and it is always a relief to be far away from chain stores."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Lots of quirky shops, cafes and great food places serving a variety of cuisines. It is a fantastic area and Masjid Sultan, which is nearby, is definitely worth a visit for both non-Muslims and Muslims alike"
,,Hidden Gem,5.0,,"We stumbled across Haji Lane by accident and I'm so glad we did. Amazing little restaurants and shops along this pedestrian road. Perfect for lunch, sundowners or dinner."
,,moslem strong cultural side - halal food,4.0,,"This place is significantly different. This is like Malay/Moslem town of Singapore.

Many shops, selling malay and middle eastern goods.

if Halal food is what you are looking for, this area is the answer.

Many very good halal restaurants.....

Hajjah Maemunah is one of my favorite."
,,Trendy local buzz,4.0,,"There's a jazz bar, a cafe playing old recordings so it is interesting and charming neighborhood. In the old days, haji lane was where pilgrims would stay while waiting for boats to mecca for their haj."
,,nice,4.0,,"This lane was included in the pushbike tour of Singapore, the café in this picture nada great Singapore coffee & best tasting toast I have had, included on cycling tour I reviewed also."
,,Great Spot for drinks,4.0,,Took a walk around Haji Lane and Bali Lane last Friday night whilst on holidays in Singpaore. Great little area with a really good vibe to it. Sat at an outside bar and had a few beers which were very reasonably priced for this City. Many musician playing at different bars around here. Really enjoyable night.
,,A gem,5.0,,Great place to explore with friends - less clinical than other areas in Singapore. Head to Arab street for good food after you've explored here
,,Love a bit of haggling,5.0,,"One side Arab street, Haji Street the other right over the road from our hotel, the Park Royal on Beach. Don't try to haggle down a ""fixed price"" but everything else is fair game. Go on, try it, it's fun, we all like bargains don't we and trust me, they still make money"
,,Visiting at the wrong time,3.0,,"We heard that haji land was the happening place in singapore. The bad thing we already plan our trip for the day, and decided to visiting haji land at the morning. We arrived at 8am and no store or booth was open, then we just take some art picture and continue our trip. Hope we can visiting this place at noon or night."
,,colourful,4.0,,"get there after 12pm as most stores don't open till then. We got there about 11.15 - 11.30 a few places were open.
Lots of cute boutiques, vintage stores lots of little places you can grab a drink or food, walk the lane then the surrounding streets which leads to Arab district"
,,HAJI LANE,5.0,,"Love this lane as it is filled with nearby BUGIS shopping centre, Mosque and lots of cafetarias and pubs including the famous blue jazz"
,,"Great street, full of surprises",4.0,,"A very colourful lane with lots of bars, restaurants, boutiques. etc. Very narrow lane which traffic still uses.

,,Bohemian corner of Singapore,4.0,,"Street art, graffiti, bohemian cafes, funky names of outlets and an aura of creativity is what you get in Haji Lane. Love the flea market style assorted art works."
,,A different Singapore,4.0,,"After having seen so many shopping malls with basicly all the same retailers and franchise shops. Haji lane is a welcome change to this all. Colourfull, laid back, original and refreshing.
Have a stroll through the streets and a cool beer or cocktail outside one of the many bars."
,,Happening!,5.0,,"Part of the arab quarter, nice young crowd with really laid back atmosphere, it is an open air mall with an arab feel, i guess this is the closest i can get to be in arab, minus those camels of course..."
,,"Lively, cultural",4.0,,"A lively place in the evenings and weekends full of bars, cafés and restaurants. Like Singapore itself, a good mixture of cultures."
,,"Quirky, cute and colourful street",5.0,,"In this unique, narrow street you find colorful shophouses. In those shophouses are tiny shops, cafes, bars and restaurants.

Don't forget to go up the stairs, since usually there is another shop there.

You can also find some beautiful street art in the area.

My personal favorites are Blu Jazz and Piedra Negra.

The small businesses have odd opening hours, so mornings are not your best option.

I wrote about Haji Lane several times on my blog curlytraveller.com"
,,A surprise around many corners,5.0,,If you are into photography then Haji Lane is a good place to start and an interesting place to be to see street Art. You have to have a wander round otherwise you will miss many of the excellent works. Not sure who carries out these magnificient works of art - maybe its Art students who have a place nearby.
,,"Art, Restaurants, Cafes and Shopping",5.0,,"Learn more about the minority cultures in Singapore, appreciate the different foods of our multi racial ethnicities, marvel at the art pieces and beautiful clothing. Cafe hop andtak lots of pictures. This is the world condensed in one spot"

,,Modern art in the old street,4.0,,You might encounter lots of graffiti a long this lane. I would suggest you come here in the morning or late evening. 8-9am should be nice
,,Great Street to see Unique Designers and Designs,4.0,,"As another traveler said, you could spend hours here exploring the shops - if you are interested in unique and creative designers and designs. I always see something new."

,,Cute vintage shopping street,4.0,,Great architectures for photographers! Also great for art and vintage shoppers! Interesting street in the middle of this commercial city. I love the vintage clothing stores! My only disappointment is that you cannot try on before you buy.
,,Not another Orchard Rd,4.0,,"Haji Lane is a short street, filled with eclectic stores (clothing and more) and bars. It is a nice stroll and can occupy you for quite a while."
,,Not so bad at all,4.0,,"Less than what I expected. We went there during the day so most of the shop is closed. Not much to do during the day, but the Egypthian Restaurant there is superb!"
,,Vibrant Arab culture,4.0,,A reflection of vibrant Arab culture and food. A must go if you have a few hours extra in Singapore.
,,Place To Kill Time,3.0,,"I didn't think it was anything special. They have some boutique shops and bar/cafes to kill time. The graffiti on the walls were kind of neat to see, but would not make this a priority on your list."
,,Lovely place,5.0,,"if your thing is to wonder around and discovering new spots to get the perfect shot, this is the place to spend a whole afternoon after enjoying a delicious lunch at any of their many coffee shops. Ideal also for some shopping of original design or handcrafted souvenirs AND even to take feng shui lessons on how to decorate your house.
Loved this place."
,,unique spot,3.0,,love the lane and its unique decoration. some boutiques are along the way. not much to see but if you like some unique background ..it could be the one. 30minutes enough to hang around.. go there when it is sunny
,,Funky and Trendy,4.0,,This is a fun extension of the Arab Street experience. There are many trenty shops and Middle Eastern restaurants to explore.

,,Back to basic,5.0,,"A place where u can take photos, as much as u want cos no one gonn stop u from doing so ! There are many small little shops u can go to as a retail therapy, forget bout the malls, support independent shop ! After shopping, there are some trukish resturants awaits to fill up ur tummy. Or some coffee n cakes jus around the corner in between shops."
,,Haji Lane,5.0,,Quaint and diverse shops makes Haji Lane a wonderful place to visit. Promised myself to take time to explore the place longer next time I visit Singapore.
,,Bohemian Rhapsody,5.0,,"I have always love the quaint and the eclectic, and for me, Haji Lane is the ultimate! And I can't believe that I have not been to this place! Like, where have I been all this time before?

Situated within the Arab Street enclave, this place is such a joy to visit! It's like I have been transported to a different world when I am here. Cutesy, avant-garde , eclectic small shops dotted this tiny lane. There's this unmistaken lovely middle-eastern / bohemian fun vibe about this place. Spotted a Turkish shop selling colourful lamps - reminded me of my holiday in Istanbul many, many years back!!

Do visit this area in the late afternoon as the whole place is quite deserted in the morning. And while you are at it, , venture on to the equally interesting surrounding area of Arab Street, the Muslim enclave of Singapore.

You won't be disappointed. Visit !!"
,,Boutique Middle Eastern Street,4.0,,"Boutique shops of middle eastern nature with food, bars, clothes and jewellery all around. Worth cultural visit!"
,,Grab a local before you go,4.0,,"I used to work in this area until recently. This place is on the itinerary of many tours, with the busloads of tourists coming through. While Haji Lane IS a lane, we often think of all the other streets connected to it and the immediate area around it as part of Haji Lane's culture.

Pro tip: Grab a local to bring you around. There are cafes and eating spots everywhere, but only some are great while the rest are tourist traps. This is also a shopping spot for hipsters, street culture, and some niche markets of alternative fashion.

And, of course, the street graffiti is an Instagram/selfie favorite."

,,Groovy little place in Singapore,5.0,,"Haji Lane reminds me of the laneways of Melbourne, Australia. Very funky, lots of street art, cute little shops and good bars.

,,Upcoming and interesting,3.0,,Haji Street is adjacent to the more popular Arab Street where most tours will send you. It is less crowded and not quite so touristy. There are some lovely little local shops and cafes springing up there
,,cute boutiques and colorful shops,3.0,,"my colleague sported a lovely black and gold statement necklace that looked absolutely stunning, so i had to ask where she got it. she sent me to soon lee on haji lane. i took the train to bugis, where i then walked about 2 blocks to get there. it's quite easy to find.

i found haji lane to be exactly what i imagined it to be....a lane lined with cute colorful boutiques and shops. there were plenty of vintage-esque and handmade clothes shops, coffee shops and bars, home decore/stationary stores and the one-off bike and hat shops. i planned to spend an hour there, but ended up going through the shops rather quickly as they were all a bit too young for my taste. i ended up grabbing a coffee and reading for an hour before i headed off for dinner. i would recommend a quick visit here if it's not too far out of the way, but you dont need more than an hour here."
,,Nice Surpise,5.0,,"I had read the reviews and thought we better check it out. I was totally surprised. You think when you are walking there that it will be a dirty side street with nothing there, but when you arrive it is this tiny street that has kept the old look with up class shops. I loved seeing something like this. It was really funky. Their are some murals on the wall which are a great photo opportunity. Its a little expensive but there is a biscuit place you will small before you get to it. Go in and taste. They are flour free and so yummy. Worth the visit. Get off at the Bugis Station if arriving by mrt, a short walk from there"
,,The Spice trail..,5.0,,"Besides Haji Lane there is the wonderful Arab Street too, where you can find exotic silks and exquisite cloths, hand made jewelry, fine Vegetarian food from the Indian Continent, Turkish and Persian food, and the beautiful Sultan Mosque.
And, why not visit Little India? it is a haven of fine performs and aroma of burning Sandlewood and slow burning incense..and superb Indian food of all types, in the market food hall, and cafes. Then take a taxi to Geylang Serai, an area where you find Malay shops selling colourful traditional clothes and wonderful Malaysian dishes in the food halls in the shopping Malls."
,,How quirky is this?,5.0,,Oh my - how beautiful and different. Well worth the visit to this quirky little street. Don't go before 11am as nothing will be open.shows are
,,Singapore's version of Carnaby Street in London,5.0,,"This street makes a refreshing change after all the market-type shops selling cheap gifts in China Town. Allow time to wander in and out of all the different types of shops (not all typically Singaporean), Whenicreate good and further along, lovely shop for cup of tea and excellent sponge cake."
,,a landmark lane,5.0,,"tucked away in the Muslim quarter of Singapore,thjis lane has it all.shops,boutiques and cafes.its an escape from the malls that overrun the city.its frequented by the young and trendy.the 17 new cafes have also added to the charm of this place.huge colourful paintings on the wall make me come often to this lane at Kampong Glam neighbourhood."
,,Little by-lane of Arab Street,4.0,,It is a narrow street in Arab Street area but offers two restaurants with Live Music. Good Place to spend an evening.
,,Unique experience,5.0,,"This is a small lane with 2 storied buildings on both sides. The buildings house a variety of establishments from coffee shops and bars to boutique clothing, accessories and unique souvenir shops. In the evenings, the narrow street gets blocked for traffic and the bars bring out their tables on to the road. Graffiti filled walls, loud music courtesy DJs set up at the entrance of the shops, people dancing on the streets etc., add to the unique experience. Baghdad and Arab streets, nearby, also deserve a walk through."
,,Cool place to drop by !,4.0,,"Nice chic place mostly for youngsters . Have lots of cafes, eateries and other shops as well. Wonderful place to drop by"
,,Better go to Arab Street,3.0,,"Overrated, average street full of bars. You like bars? You came to the right place. The best thing is Arab street, one street ahead. Full of attractive, little different, shops. And maybe, the upcoming western parts of Chinatown are just a little more attractive."
,,Interesting Little street in Arab Quarter,4.0,,"Have been to Singapore a few times in recent years, however never quite made it to Haji Lane. Booked our selves on a Hop Off and Off Bus experience for the day so that we can get dropped off there, stay a little while and then off somewhere else. We arrived around 12 noon, a number of the shops and a few of the cafes were open. For browsing the street, shopping etc 1 hr is enough as there really is not a lot happening around there at that time of the day. Decided to have look for a coffee and cake, there was not a lot happening there, found a little coffee shop, that looked quite nice and clean and ordered a latte and some cake, this was OK,, not great but very expensive approx $27 AUD for the 2 of us. After wandering down the street and admiring some of the street art and browsed some of the eclectic little shops, all with tourist prices to match we hopped back on our hop off and off bus and then went down to the waterfront. Seen Haji once, not in a hurry to get back down. Perhaps next time later in the day"
,,A lot of culture,5.0,,There is a lot of culture in this part of town. There are many shops and cafes to explore and browse through.
,,Quaint Shopping & Food To Try,5.0,,"A charming place to explore. Good cultural heritage with lots to see, do and eat. Explore the numerous quaint shops, crafts, fashion and more. Try the wide diverse mix of food here. Explore the shops for souvenirs and crafts."
,,Hipster heaven,5.0,,"Heaps of indie places (cafes, shops) to explore. Perfect for an afternoon in the city centre. And don't forget to bring your camera!"
,,Great after hours vibe,4.0,,"Get out of the giant shopping malls and take a stroll down Haji Lane to check out new and upcoming Singapore designers. Clothes and homeware shops abound, as well as a lively bar and restaurant street which gets underway in the evenings."
,,"Fun, colorful little street",4.0,,"This is a fun street to wander. By day, there are unique shops and coffee places...at night it looks like there are lots of bars and restaurants."
,,out of singapore experience,4.0,,"frankly speaking, this is not the place for you if you are looking for a true singaporean experience (which would be better achieved if you go to the neighborhood areas like yishun or bedok). nevertheless, I really love the ambience in Haji lane! it is a short lane full of shophouses. there are many unique cafes and bars located within the lane. apart from cafes, there are also many unique boutique shops. there shops are not that cheap but they do sell pretty merchandise. the walls of the lane are colorful with grafiti and some of the shops also display their goods outside. the shophouses themselves are colorful and really interesting! many people go there to take photos. overall, it is worth a visit for a chill (:"
,,Little India,5.0,,A little slice if India in Singapore with the aroma of curry spices everywhere. Hawker stalls selling Indian food and lots of small shops stocked with spices etc.
,,Colourful and trendy,4.0,,"This area is really colourful and interesting. There are nice decorating shops, good for windows shopping. The most impressive one is the cafe name Selfie Coffee. This cafe put your selfie picture into your drink. I really surprised and impressed because I didn't expect to see my face in my coffee. (Don't expect the taste of the coffee)"
,,Picturesque area,5.0,,The murals everywhere. Small stores and pubs. Too hot to visit in the afternoon. Nice ambiance before sunset.
,,A different touch of Singapore,4.0,,It didn't feel like I was in Singapore when walking along Haji Lane. Loved walking along that small street and the area around Kampong Glam. Interesting murals on the wall at the end of Haji Lane near Beach Street. For sure will visit that place again next time I'm in Singapore.
,,Little slice of melbourne,4.0,,"Clearly the hippest area of Singapore, loved the street art and boutique shops. Totally different feel to the likes of Little India and. Chinatown."
,,Many variety,4.0,,"Many small shop houses. But the place is as entertaining as it decorate. Not that cheap but is good quality. Best of all, the service there is well done."
,,exciting time,4.0,,there were a lot of men in the area. i like eating at one of the popular and crowded muslim stores. they served briyani and chicken wings. food was superb. low cost.
,,Small stores and bars,5.0,,"Lively lane from 12pm til early morning. Many little shops on the sides, some of them sell the same stuff. Don't be afraid going up the stairs, there're always more stuff on 1st floor. They have performers at night at the bars, cool to hang out."
,,Fantastic street art & vibe,4.0,,"A quaint little lane adjoining the more famous Arab Street, Haji Lane doesn't figure on the tourist radar much. Haji Lane starts off with chic boutiques, which may look expensive but are quite affordable. The 2nd half of the street has little bars/hangouts along both sides of the lane. But what makes this a must-see is the street art and the vibe of the place. Apparently, the place transforms into a night spot after dark. We visited it at 11pm at night as well but there was not much happening, probably because it was a weekday"
,,Love this street,5.0,,"The Kampong Glam neighbourhood with Arab Street and Haji Lane beats Little India hands down. Here we have trendy hangouts for beatnicks. latte drinkers and hipsters. Next door in Arab Street its carpets, saris and perfumes."
,,Meh...more like Hipster Lane....?,2.0,,"Bring your credit card. ...long gone are the days of Singapore as a shoppers ""Bargain"" paradise. ...whilst Haji Lane is different in look/feel and location to the many, many, many shopping malls selling generic designer brands that are available anywhere....the ""trendy/hipster vibe"" feels a little forced with bearded and tattooed young men having a chai soy latte after riding their ""fixies"" through the lane way... and whilst there are a few unique/local designer outlets they are few and far between with the bulk selling stuff you can get all over Singapore... or the Internet. .."
,,Super trendy lane for the independent fashion boutiques!,4.0,,"Haji Lane is in the Kampong Glam neighbourhood of Singapore. Young people frequent the shophouses along this lane for the independent fashion boutiques. You can find originality of Singaporean hip and young designers! Truly stylish fashion, home, and lifestyle!"
,,Great vibe!,4.0,,"I only visited Haji Lane before I left Singapore after four years. This place really lives up to its name with beautiful and special streets arts, music, and pretty boutiques. I like those little shops upstairs when I walked up to another world. The street embraces an artistic overlook and atmosphere with antique decorated house two sides of the lane. crowded bar and some guys singing randomly. It can make you feel un-Singapore but so-Singapore at the same time.

However, there are two things that bother me which are most of the shops are really expensive and maybe in my opinions, just for window shopping, not for actual buying. The second is, which are good and bad, I guess, this place becomes too famous so there are so many people on the street. It was hard to take a good photo without people photobombing. Haha."
,,Best spot in town!,5.0,,"I almost don't want to write a review because I don't want Haji Lane to become any more touristy. It is my favorite place in Singapore for a chill atmosphere, great people watching and excellent live music. The whole Kampong Glam neighborhood has a great selection of shops and restaurants. Haji Lane particularly has some fantastic boutiques with a lot of hand made and unique items... hard to find in commercialized Singapore!"
,,Great atmosphere,4.0,,"This is well worth a visit it's very colourful, full of history but also home to some trendy little shops."
,,Super Trendy,5.0,,Love this area. Lots of good cafe and restaurant. Nice place to hang out. Many hand crafted/handmade stores.
,,Haji Lane! Must visit at night!,4.0,,"Haji lane is situated close to Bugis MRT in Singapore. This place is a artistically designed lane. It has cafes and bars. This place must be visited in the evening. This is very close to Arab street which one can visit for great food.

Its's a good place for a night visit and for some fun!"
,,cool,4.0,,Haji lane is a small street at bugis with cool street art at the end of the street. It was very hot to go there in the afternoon. I recommend you to go there around 3 or 4pm
,,Quaint Neighborhood with Lots of Indie Stores,4.0,,"This is located close to Bugis MRT and Beach Road area.

Its an interesting neighborhood with narrow street and long rows of shophouses lining both sides of the street.

The shophouses house many indie stores selling a wide range of merchandise such as fashion, grooming, trinklets, and even bicycles!

There are also cafes, restaurants and pubs where you can pop into for a quick bite or drink.

Some walls are also filled with graffiti art which will make a good photo memory!"
,,"Must Visit funky, fancy grafitti mural Street",5.0,,This is one of the must visit places that lots of tourist dont know. You can walk from Bugis station to here. This is next to Arab street. This lane has so many cute restarant that has vivid themes. Cute boutique cafes with so colorful tables and chairs makes the surroundings more funky. You can see magnificent grafitti murals on the sides of buildings and dont forget to picture them. It is so colorful and Day and Night has it's very own unique beauty. After 6-7pm street become more happening. Roadside bands and drinks. Indeed fun place to wonder in. ( check the pics)
,,"Haji Lane, the laid back lanes of yesteryears..",5.0,,"Boutiques and cafes comes and goes in this little street known as the narrowest street in Singapore.. The street is closed after 6pm at night and that's when the life really starts with buskers and nightspots for laid back drinking and Shisha( Hookah) smoking which will soon be phased out. From bars that serve sushi and Japanese food, to hairstylists, to fashionable boutiques and Pop up stores, it has plenty to serve everyone.

As a Muslim traveller you will also have no shortage of good food around the area, Middle Eastern, western and European fare such as French Desserts and Pastries if you like!

Although it's not exactly on Haji Lane you have Swedish Restaurant Fika which is Halal, I am cafe (halal) at the end which is popular for its food and rainbow cakes, Cad cafe (non halal) & Blu Jaz (non halal)which is popular with expats and lunch. Merdandy bar for drinks after work.
And Le Kue, a halal French patisserie which has a wide variety of displayed and plated desserts such as Le Sphere, a chocolate orb which melts..

*pictures posted are of Le Kue which serves classic French and for their signatures Asian inspired French desserts, such as Pandan Coconut Opera, Gula Melaka Creme Brûlée and La Tropique (Caramel Creme, Passionfruit and Gula Melaka)"
,,Should come at night,3.0,,"We come in the afternoon but some of the bar and shops are still closed, we didn't walk very long as we think the night life would be much better so we decided to come again at night."
,,"Haji Lane, Singapore",5.0,,"Haji Lane is this very colourful and eclectic little laneway in the Bugis district of Singapore. It has old shop houses that have been painted in beautiful bright colours, there are magnificent grafitti murals on the sides of buildings, great little coffee shops and cafes, you can find amazing middle eastern food in the nearby eateries surrounding the gorgeous Sultans Mosque. Great place to wander and take great photos. A must visit when in singapore. But get there early, it gets busy around lunch time so photos are harded to take."
,,Hip corner of singaoire,4.0,,A good selection of boutique shops with some interesting local arts and crafts. There are a few nice cafes and bar as well. Always popular at night for a drink and even some dancing on the street when the music and crowd is right.
,,Interesting shops but not many things for a 188cm tall guy,4.0,,"Haji Lane is good for shopping local design and fashion. There are many stores selling items for interior design, all sorts of knick knack, unique clothes and accessories. You might find something for yourself or as a gift even if you're not looking for something specific. Some stores are open from 12pm so it's better to go in the afternoon. You can see some really fascinating street art on the walls of the houses if that's something that interests you. Unfortunately mens' clothing is primarily for local buyer and for instance it was hard to find shirts that were suitable for a 188cm tall guy, not to mention pants that would fit."
,,Halal Hipster? Why not?,4.0,,"This place does NOT get going early. I was following a guide book that traced out walks of the city. To be fair the book did warn me that the Arab Quarter walk needed to be started late, so when I rocked up at 10am and everything was dead… well I went to an air conditioned mall and came back later!

This neighborhood seems to have 2 lives. In the morning (11 am onward) there are funky hipster shops that could fit in anywhere in the world.

I made a return visit with my husband at around 7pm and many of the shops were already closed, to his disappointment and mine, but the bars were gearing up. I am not sure how I felt about this with the posters in the neighborhood declaring the area alcohol free, but ""it is what it is""…

A beautiful mix of funky and traditional. You just need to get the timing right to see it all..."
,,Charming Haji Lane,5.0,,"Haji Lane is a street in Singapore where the most charming shophouses are situated. Shophouses are common in Singapore where a family can have both a shop and a house in only one rented part of a low rise building. But the twist in Haji Lane's shopshouses is the way they are artistically designed and uniquely fabricated. So if you're gonna have a chance to visit Singapore, never miss to see Haji Lane! Load up your camera with a full battery and an empty memory card so you could take snapshots in all corners of this eclectic shopping district in Asia."
,,2 Years as Haji Lane's neighbour,5.0,,"Having lived 2 years directly next to Haji Lane, I love every bit of it. for Tourist, it is a nice colorful area with plentiful of wall murals for selfie and ample of alternative designer shopping experience. For me, however, it is where friends gather, businesses knows each other and are (at most times) genuinely friendly and supportive of each other. A rare quality already missing in most parts of Singapore (absent already even at the 2 major lanes next door).

After the Shisha bans, the night life lane's business plummeted a lot. Still, it remains as a good place to catch up with friends as it does have a nice alternative vibes, not sleazy like Clarke Quay, not business-like as Raffles, it is a friend, casual vibe which allows you to be yourself.

If you visit during day time, then please come after 11am as none of the shops will open before hand. (I remember telling early bird tourist countless times to come back at least after 5pm for maximum experience of Haji lane).

There are way too many good shopping place in Haji Lane, I can only name a few off the top of my head:

Recommended shops during day time visit:

Restaurant: Going Om, I am....,
Shopping: The Alternative Store, Life by Design, Al's cookies (YUM).

There is a shop call Simplicity where they have friendly Pugs who loves a tummy rub and great scratch.

If you ever see a painting of a French Bulldog Shogun in a restaurant, that's paint after my French Bulldog! :) That's how friendly and close the neighbors are."
,,Artsy,4.0,,Haji street is worth a visit if for nothing else than to look at the artwork on the buildings. We found selfie coffee to be an interesting find while walking around the area as well.
,,A great alternative to shopping malls,5.0,,"Haji Lane is such a refreshing change to the hundreds of cookie-cutter shopping malls in Singapore. A short, narrow walking street jam-packed with local independent boutiques and quirky shops and cafes. Must visit shops in the lane are Dulcet Fig for vintage apparel, I AM cafe for a great selection of desserts and coffee, and The Nail Social (which is also a social enterprise to empower local women...yay!) for a relaxing pedicure and massage for weary feet.

Stay on till the sun goes down and have a hearty pita and hummus dinner at one of the Middle Eastern restaurants along Arab Street. Then come back to Going Om at Haji Lane for a drink and to listen to the awesome live local bands!"
,,Great day out,4.0,,Haji Lane is a must visit for fashionistas with the wide variety of stores. The cafes are great and the area has a cool vibe

,,"Quaint, engaging, hipster and on trend.",4.0,,"Lots of interesting little shops, boutiques and bars. Very easy to wile away an afternoon. Would definitely include on a return trip."
,,Horrible shopping experience in Chic Fever @Haji Lane (2nd Lane),1.0,,"I was walking along with my daughter in Haji Lane. As we entered into the shop called ""Chic Fever"", we were amazed with the ambience in there. Unaware of no-phototaking rule in the shop, I wanted to take a picture to promote the shop. As...More"
,,Street Art Sightseeing,3.0,,"It was a little too crowded when i visited this place. Lot's of full cafes and quite difficult to find good spot to take a picture. Good to stroll around and see the street art, graffiti, and unique boutiques. A bit hot as i went...More"
,,Eclectic vibe,4.0,,"I was staying at the Parkroyal in Beach Road and this is conveniently just across the road. Lots of little boutiques which are priced in the higher price bracket but not exorbitant. I purchased some nice original handmade pieces. Street Art, bars, restaurants and original...More"
,,Get your street art fix,4.0,,"Coming from Melbourne and having travelled in many major world cities- it can feel a bit weird not to see any graffiti in urban areas. Haji Lane will sort that out. Singapore, in its inimitable way - has set aside a discrete area for that....More"
,,A great break from all those malls!,5.0,,"In Singapore, the dozens of shopping malls can get a bit repetitive after a while. Haji Lane is a great departure from that. It's not a particularly long street but you can spend a good hour or two here just popping into all the shops...More"
,,Don't go in the morning,3.0,,"Yes. I suggest you visit Haji Lane in the afternoon. This is because almost all shops are still closed in the morning. Though items here are little bit pricey, it's still one of the best ways to experience Singapore. It's very different from the modern and busy city. It's just a very small street (almost hidden) so make sure to spot the signage with the street name written on."
,,Vibrant back lane in conservative Singapore!,5.0,,"Haji Lane is a great way to spend an hour or two when in the Kampong Glam/Bugis area. It is full of dinky little shops, cafes, bars etc and is one of the few places in Singapore you'll find street art/graffiti. There's always some live music going on so you're bound to find something you like when having a wander."
,,Hipsters street,3.0,,"Pretty shops and cafes, beautiful but not authentic. I found a cool street singer there who is quite amusing to talk to for a moment but that's all. Worth to visit if you have time though."
,,Funky vibe and street scene,5.0,,"In search of more authentic areas outside of the designer, shiny high rise quarters, Haji Lane and neighbouring streets are a haven of quirkiness. Having lived in Brighton in the UK, this area feels the nearest thing Singapore has to a boho, artistic lanes area. Day time you can enjoy the independent shops from interesting interior shops, independent designers to affordable leather goods as well as enjoy the cafes and street terraces. At night the bars some to life - try 'no menu' cocktails at Bar Stories where they make you a drink according to your tastes and preferences. The Mexican restaurant at the top of the lane is surprisingly good with spicy guacamole made at your table and good ceviche."
,,Art in modernization,4.0,,"This is not a huge area, just about a straight block consists of shops sells art things and some restaurant. Dont expect to find cheap price, most of shops sells pricey stuffs. What i like that each shop paint their store differently and set it uniquely.. I did a lot of photograph here. This area open at 12pm, if you want to take a picture of this area my suggestion to go at 4-5pm, as sun not really hot and not really bright.. You can enjoy dinner or having a chit chat with friends in some cafes.."
,,Interesting little area.,5.0,,Lots of quirky and interesting places to see. Had a nice drink and enjoyed an eating. Heaps of places to buy material and quirky shops. Great fun.
,,Great Discovery in Singapore,5.0,,"Haji Lane was, by far, one of my favourite places in Singapore because of its arty and cultural vibe, architecture, and collection of stores. It was a very ""cool"" spot. There are some developing hip/arty areas such as Tiong Bahru or Gilman Barracks, but those areas don't seem completely finished and not as ""gathered"". Unfortunately, I only discovered this street hours before I had to leave Singapore, so I didn't stay long enough to check out all of the shops. But, I found Soon Lee that had unique & edgy, but sweet designs and handcrafted jewelry by a Singaporean designer. I also loved the Mexican restaurant near Beach Road.

If you are searching for a unique shopping and 'cafe cool' experience, then make sure you put Haji Lane on the top of the list."
,,one choice of shopping place,4.0,,"Every shop has its characteristic, you can buy some unusual stuff here, if you pay more patience to look for. Both entry of lane have two nice restaurants, one is american, the other is malay+chinese noodle....you can try when you visit here!"
,,Artsy & funky,5.0,,"Great place to come for a stroll - filled with alot of different arty shops perfect for gifts. Very unique stores selling mostly homewares, jewelleries, art, ornaments and clothing. Don't come here expecting dirt cheap prices - shops are high end with good quality merchandise which means it can be a little pricey ( but not over the top ). Couple cute bars on this Lane as well and same block as some great restaurants. Worth a visit"
,,different,4.0,,"We forgot that some shops open at 12, as they stay open late at night, so got there too early.
Interesting shops with an array of goods.
Certainly not a cheap area, and we didn't buy anything, but we enjoyed looking at all the different stuff.
Quite a few antique type objects, but mainly British based, which was interesting.
Some quirky objects - definitely worth a visit."
,,Don't go in the morning,3.0,,"Yes. I suggest you visit Haji Lane in the afternoon. This is because almost all shops are still closed in the morning. Though items here are little bit pricey, it's still one of the best ways to experience Singapore. It's very different from the modern and busy city. It's just a very small street (almost hidden) so make sure to spot the signage with the street name written on."
,,Vibrant back lane in conservative Singapore!,5.0,,"Haji Lane is a great way to spend an hour or two when in the Kampong Glam/Bugis area. It is full of dinky little shops, cafes, bars etc and is one of the few places in Singapore you'll find street art/graffiti. There's always some live music going on so you're bound to find something you like when having a wander."
,,Hipsters street,3.0,,"Pretty shops and cafes, beautiful but not authentic. I found a cool street singer there who is quite amusing to talk to for a moment but that's all. Worth to visit if you have time though."
,,Funky vibe and street scene,5.0,,"In search of more authentic areas outside of the designer, shiny high rise quarters, Haji Lane and neighbouring streets are a haven of quirkiness. Having lived in Brighton in the UK, this area feels the nearest thing Singapore has to a boho, artistic lanes area. Day time you can enjoy the independent shops from interesting interior shops, independent designers to affordable leather goods as well as enjoy the cafes and street terraces. At night the bars some to life - try 'no menu' cocktails at Bar Stories where they make you a drink according to your tastes and preferences. The Mexican restaurant at the top of the lane is surprisingly good with spicy guacamole made at your table and good ceviche."
,,Art in modernization,4.0,,"This is not a huge area, just about a straight block consists of shops sells art things and some restaurant. Dont expect to find cheap price, most of shops sells pricey stuffs. What i like that each shop paint their store differently and set it uniquely.. I did a lot of photograph here. This area open at 12pm, if you want to take a picture of this area my suggestion to go at 4-5pm, as sun not really hot and not really bright.. You can enjoy dinner or having a chit chat with friends in some cafes.."
,,Interesting little area.,5.0,,Lots of quirky and interesting places to see. Had a nice drink and enjoyed an eating. Heaps of places to buy material and quirky shops. Great fun.
,,Great Discovery in Singapore,5.0,,"Haji Lane was, by far, one of my favourite places in Singapore because of its arty and cultural vibe, architecture, and collection of stores. It was a very ""cool"" spot. There are some developing hip/arty areas such as Tiong Bahru or Gilman Barracks, but those areas don't seem completely finished and not as ""gathered"". Unfortunately, I only discovered this street hours before I had to leave Singapore, so I didn't stay long enough to check out all of the shops. But, I found Soon Lee that had unique & edgy, but sweet designs and handcrafted jewelry by a Singaporean designer. I also loved the Mexican restaurant near Beach Road.

,,Great place for the female shopper.,4.0,,"Haji Lane is a relatively short lane in the Muslim quarter of Singapore but don't let that put you off as alcoholic beverages (along with some very tasty meals) are sold in almost all the local bars and eateries. It is just a short walk from the Bugis subway station. I say it is a great place for the girls to shop because there is relatively little merchandise available for us menfolk but that is not to say it isn't totally uninteresting to us males. The architecture is old and it is fascinating.. There are however the occasional curio shops where a man can find something of appeal but on the whole this is a place for the girls.
As an aside running parallel just a short away is Arab street which is lined with material and fabric shops again worth a visit if only to gaze upon the kaleidoscope of brilliant colours.
If you have the time Haji place is worth the visit."
,,Worth a visit if in the area but there are better places in Singapore.,3.0,,"I was exploring the Kampong Glam area of Singapore, (the Sultan Mosque, Arab Street, etc.), and so took a stroll down 'Haji Lane' as I had read a bit about it here on Trip Advisor.

It's a narrow alley that runs parallel to Arab Street which has nice colonial architecture and some nice independent offbeat shops, bars and cafés.

In my opinion I give it an Average rating as it is worth a walk along if you are in a 'poke about in the shops mood' but as far as sightseeing goes there are far more interesting places worth spending your time at if your time in Singapore is limited."
,,Slightly overrated but still worth a visit,3.0,,Purposely went to Haji Lane after reading about many new cafes opening around the area. Just a few small cafes sandwiched between lots of boutiques- was definitely expecting more. The mural at the end of the lane was pretty neat but overall I would say it's just alright.
,,Nothing to rave about,2.0,,Didn't think terribly much about this raved about place. Shops are for tiny sized people. Got a good photo of the local mosk round the corner.
,,something that you should never missed!,5.0,,this is the lane where you will find art installation along the road. must visit place and nice place for photo-taking.
,,My favorite place in Singapore,5.0,,I have been to Singapore more than 10 times. This was the first time that I heard about this place. It becomes a place that I am looking forward to going to. I love the color and the fun shops. It is a good contrast from the Orchard road shopping. It has something that you may not find elsewhere.
,,Absolutely brilliant - a must visit,5.0,,"Not sure how many people are aware of this street, we found it by chance when visiting the Campong Glam area.
Filled with beautiful boutiques with everything from clothing to homeware and a vintage vibe. We spent hours nipping in and out of every shop as they were all so gorgeous!"
,,My favourite place in Singapore!,5.0,,"Really cute street with lots of boutique clothing/homewares/craft/jewellery stores - was such a nice shopping experience after spending way too much time in air-conditioned malls in Singapore! There are so many nice cafes in the area too, was really difficult to decide where to eat. Can't wait to visit here again in November."
,,"Interesting cultural stop, but beware when you visit",3.0,,"Haji Lane is a small, colorful street with lots of quaint quirky shops. A block from an historic mosque and tastes and smells of Turkey, India and the Middle East. But...most do the shops and cafés are closed on Sundays and Mondays AND scant few of them are open before 13:00 the rest of the week."
,,"Tiny little street, gets busy at night",4.0,,"When I was researching for an interesting place to visit, I found Haji Lane listed as a shopping place. I love these little streets that line up with shops and restaurants, and this is definitely a very interesting place to visit, even if you're just there to look. This was just along my route from my hostel to the MRT, and I decided to take this route for a more interesting walk. One morning, I passed by the place, and it was quiet and empty. I enjoyed it, despite the non-peak hours as I was able to look around more. Then coming back at night, the place was packed. There are quite a number of bars too and my friend brought me to one as well, after our dinner in Bugis. We had a great weekday night chilling in the area :-)"
,,Bar street,4.0,,"It is a narrow street full of bars and little restaurant situated in the arab quarter of Singapore. On weekend it is full of people, except on sunday night when most of the places are closed. It is the best place to spend the night in this part of the city, it worths a visit for sure for lunch, dinner or just for a drink with live music."
,,A cool little village,4.0,,"I loved Haji Lane, a rustic little place with small shops, bars and great places to hang out, eat or just take a walk around. The Turkish food is amazing and the boutiques have some unique items to buy. Well worth checking out at least once! I will be back..."
,,Quite interesting,3.0,,"Some interesting cafes, some interesting streetwear shops, some interesting graffiti. The Haji Lane is quite interesting, but it doesn't have something you can't find anywhere else. Would rather go to the Bay, the Chinatown, or even Clarke Quay."
,,Market stall type of shops,4.0,,"Great little hole In the wall shops.
Don't be shy on venturing up stairs as the shops are much larger than the street ones.
These guys all seem to have great little bits and bobs.
Night type there are plenty of places to grab a beer and a bite to eat
And during the day all the other stores are open.
My wife and I stopped at a
Little joint and had a beer and a bowl of edamame.
Checked out the fashion stores and a few are open late
Well worth a visit if you like markets"
,,my kind of street,5.0,,"I love, love, love Haji lane. From the graffiti art on the walls to the shops that ranges from fashion, art to quirky collectibles to the small cafes, restaurants & bars, this is young art district for the new boheme. One day is not enough to visit, explore & enjoy all of the things this place can offer. I wish i have an apartment on top of one of the shops in this street. I wish I have a shop here. Love it!"
,,Disappointed on seeing such great reviews,2.0,,"It was only a small lane with a few shops, restaurants and bars. Shops were over priced. A few graffitti on shop walls, I walked out of it in 10 minutes! Found a mosque the other side of the lane which is more interesting!"
,,Boring,3.0,,"Read so much about haji lane and my interest was piqued. Had a chance to meet a friend for dinner here and walked along the lane

Oh boy, it was boring. A couple of clothes stores which didn't look very inspiring. Middle eastern and arab restaurants which look average to me, since i've been to the middle east and turkey many times. The lane was short, like 200m short, so i don't know how many can spend many hours there. They must have taken a nap

Had dinner at a mexican restaurant at the end of the street and it was poor to average

What a let down"

,,Unique Lane,5.0,,Whilst in the area we visited Haji Lane and found it to be a very interesting place. There is a Camden feel to this place which makes it relaxing and fun to be on. Definitely worth coming here to experience this ambiance.
,,Love to shop in this bohemian street,5.0,,Little shops which have their own identity. Mostly vintage clothing and accessories but also some nice little bars to have a coffee or lunch. They open only at 1200 am and some even a bit later. The Arab district nearby is also nice to visit.
,,Cheap funky Fashion stores & bars,4.0,,"Small little street but so much to see! Take your time and visit the shops , most of them have original interiors , interesting little gadgets , accessories and clothes ! Don't be afraid to bargain most shops will drop at least 10% !"
,,Trendy little lane,4.0,,This is a trendy little lane full of restaurants and shops. A great place to have lunch and then stroll through all the unique boutiques along the alley. Easy to get to and then also there is so much around from here to watch to. Just around the corner is Arab Street and then not far is the huge indoor flea market. Great place to come and visit.
,,Great little lane,4.0,,This is a little lane with lots of personality in the late afternoon/evening. Checkout some of the great little shops then sit yourself down outside one of the bars and enjoy a beer with gaucamole and cornchips. They make the guacamole fresh while you watch.
,,For hip & trendy lover,4.0,,"You can find many house fashion brands here. Hip & Trendy, eg. cloths, shoes, bags, accessories, etc."
,,Pick your time,3.0,,I visited here early in the day on a Sunday and it was very quiet with a lot of the shops closed even by midday. They looked interesting but maybe weekdays are better.
,,Really enjoyed Haji Lane,4.0,,"We visited Haji Lane and really enjoyed it. Small shops, that are unique and creative. This is not a department store or mall if you are expecting this type of shopping. They have some great shops in here, well worth a visit when in singapore."
,,Unique small lane,3.0,,"Visited the Haji Lane on 22 Feb 14 , reachable within walking distance from Bugis Mrt Station, between the Bali lane and Arab Street.
Beautiful graffiti
s and nicely painted building walls was a highlight of this lane.Colorful ancient architecture was well preserved.
Nice and cozy cafes and resto's with many choices of food , ;like Egyptian ( Altazzag) ,Indian ,as well as modern out seated cafes lined up on this street.
Unique shops ,boutiques , and accessories shops sells stuffs you cannot find elsewhere in SG.
From starting point to the end , can consume only about 2 hours walk ,because its a short lane.Pluck's ice creams sells flavors out of the ordinary , and a prawn mee resto is worth to try.
Further walk you can find the Grand Sultan Mosque."
,,Loved it..,5.0,,"We went to Haji Lane on our last day in Singapore. We had already done a fair amount of shopping mostly on Orchard Rd and in various malls, and it had gotten fairly repetitive. We thought we were shopped out but thought we would visit for the architecture. This lane was like a breath of fresh air- it was completely different to the malls and while it was a short street, it was filled with shops full of trendy clothes, jewellery and bags. Unsuprisingly, we picked up a a few trendy pieces that I'm sure we wouldn't have found anywhere else. This lane is definitely worth a visit and you can get through the lane in about 1-2 hours."
,,"Amazing place for shopping, eating and a stroll",5.0,,"Tired of visiting the same malls & stores every time I visit Singapore (for that matter any part of the world), decided to explore other options and squared on Haji Lane. It was surprisngly amazing place to shop and the street itself was a beauty - small stores beautifully interiored, grafitti art on the street which was amazing. The boutiques had really nice stuff from Asian designers. Must visit. Even interesting places to eat, Pluck offers interesting ice creams with most unusual flavours."
,,Surprise gem of a street full of quirky finds,4.0,,"Was disappointed by an afternoon of shopping in mediocre and overpriced malls so Haji Lane was a breath of fresh air. The stores are more intimate, their products are different from the ones you'd find in England, and wares vary from shop to shop, all at reasonable prices. A must-visit for all shopaholics"
,,Heritage preservation,5.0,,"Very near to the Sultan Mosque, has been a conserved area for old buildings. Excellent ancient shophouses in a row beautifully conserved."
,,Haji Lane,4.0,,"Very trendy and expensive, but well worth wandering through for the interesting and colourful architecture."

,,Quirky and Amazing street,4.0,,"My family and I visited Haji Lane as we saw a lot of positive reviews about it and it was just a good 10 minute walk from our hotel (Summer View) and for reference this street is also just 3 minutes away from the Bugis MRT Station. We were pleased to find out that the street did live up to its good reviews and more. The vibe you get as soon as you get there is modern, young, lively and artsy. We loved all the shops and restaurants as each one is very interesting. We planned to only pass by but when we saw all the quirky and fun shops we just had to take our time. Find some time in your itinerary to visit this place, You will love it!

I suggest having lunch in one of the restaurants here and walk around the shops in the afternoon. Also it is right next to Arab street and is very near the Sultan Mosque."
,,Cute narrow street,4.0,,This is a really cute little street right next to Arab Street. The houses have funky paintings and the white house with colourful shutters is really lovely.
,,Nice & quirky!,4.0,,We wanted to find somewhere a little quirky to visit & saw some reviews on Haji Lane on Tripadvisor. We were glad we did as this little street has some really nice quirky shops & hip atmosphere. We found a couple of shops with nice trendy clothes & we absolutely enjoyed trying them on & deciding what to buy! I know we'll go back again for our next visit!
,,Hipster Meets Singapore Meets Indian = Amazing,5.0,,"I don't know why this little lane doesn't get more publicity. It offers a world of experiences in the length of a city block. Whatever your dining, shopping or experience preference, this place has it. All of it just steps away from the bustling Little India. This is the type of place you want to get lost and explore. You won't be disappointed."
,,Trendy quirky shops,5.0,,A lovely little lane with beautiful little shops selling trendy clothes. Nice to have a wonder around the shops and stop for coffee/food. We ate at a middle eastern restaurant which was delicious!
,,"Hip Fashion, Local Designs",5.0,,"Shopping on Haji Lane turned out to be the perfect way to end our day exploring Kampong Glam. Storefront after storefront is an independent boutique offering chic, locally-designed items. After shopping wears you out, you can stop at one of the cafes or Middle-Eastern themed restaurants on the next street over. Cash-only if you can, please, to support small businesses and start-up designers. If you're looking for a unique statement piece, this is the place to go!"
,,Hip Style in the Lane,4.0,,"A small lane but not ordinary. A lot of hip and fashionable cloths, bags, shoes, etc. Find one to present yourself to the world !"
,,haji lane and the food.,5.0,,excellent and the outdoor seating with hookah and all makes it more authentic. had chickpeas dip with pita bread.
,,a bit cliched but still full of surprises,4.0,,"Like the rest of the area, it is becoming a little too cliched but I still love visiting. Accept that most of the shops are often full of tourist tat but then be prepared to be surprised."
,,Small lovely. Lane,4.0,,I used to tour this lane walking through it is just behind Arab St I enjoyed it any time mornning or night. One i ate at egyptian restaurant. In the cafes they sereve shishas
,,Great Artistic Stores,4.0,,If your looking for shops with fashion and arts combined then come to Haji Lane. Just along Arab Street is the narrowest lane in Singapore which caters hip and trendy shops and bars you wonˊt find in malls. Your eyes will be entertained by the wall arts and even the pipes!
,,MUST GO!!!,5.0,,"This place is so cool, i have been telling everyone that i know to go there! It is a street filled with boutique shops, independant designers, cafes, restaurants, bars and there was even a live dj in the middle of the street the day that i went! I am so glad that i stayed to walk around (my friend brought me there and it was so hot that day, i was thinking of leaving as soon as my friend left!! The trick is to go INSIDE shops where there is air conditioning!!) Dont forget to go upstairs - there are shops there too!!

The surrounding area is also definitley worth going to, there are lots of shops selling fabric, buttons and other DIY things in the next street. There is also a VERY unique perfume shop there. I cant remember the name but you'll know it when you see it! There is a big apothecary table there and they can custom make you a perfume in about 90 minutes and you can even choose a unique bottle to store your perfume in.

There is also a street leading up to the mosque with a bunch of restaurants/cafes, and a bunch of shops there with some good cheap deals (i'm not talking about souvenirs, i tend not to buy those very touristy things since they rip you off for something that is usually quite useless). Dont forget about the food right outside the sultan mosque - YUM!

Only thing about this place is it's a little hard to find - but certainly worth the search!!"
,,Discover the other side of Singapore,4.0,,"Its a little street that runs parallel to Arab Street. Great little trendy shops and now occupies the old houses here, just to walk down the street in the afternoon and in the evenings are great.. seeing the old Singapore."
,,what a cool place,5.0,,"Haji lane & the arab street area is the perfect place to spend an afternoon (& night) if you are into cute old buildings, interesting boutique shopping, markets stalls (behind the mosque) & middle eastern food complete with shisha.
Easy to get to via bugis MRT & a short 5 minute walk around the raffles hospital.
While the numerous egyptian, persian, lebanese restaurants looked fun, we ate at a very cute bar/restaurant called Crostini & were rewarded with great food & coffee in air con but still with a great view out to the street.
The shops may be aimed more at the ladies - but I guarantee you will be interested & captivated by this place if you spend the time to poke around.
Will definetely go back on my next visit."
,,Great find and deserve more reviews and ratings!,5.0,,"We read about Haji Lane on a magazine before heading to Singapore. We glad we did it!!, what a cute little and interesting place.

We took the MRT to Bugis and took the exit to Raffles hospital and walk around the hospital to get to Arab St and Haji Lane, the walk itself is only about 6 mins and if you go in the afternoon is actually quite a pleasant walk.

Haji Lane is lined with small boutique shops selling very interesting stuff. We had fun checking every shops. at the end of Haji Lane, there are quite a few restaurant and bars and it seems to be happening towards night time, as they also offer shisha. We, however, ate at this small bistro cafe called Crostini next to Bar Story. Seeing there is no review for this place, I might as well added here. Its one of the only few places to eat that provide air condition if its your thing, and the small has great ambience. The food itself is very delicious, top notch quality and competitive price.

Beyond Haji Lane, if you continue walking towards the mosque, there will be more shops and restaurants and even some markets stall on the street. The night we went was Friday, so all restaurants are busy, and noisy, its very happening place.

We will definitely come back to Haji Lane and the Arab Street area."
,,"Great shopping, charming street",5.0,,"I went with three friends to Haji Lane to do a little shopping, and what a find! The shops are small stores with unique items of clothing, shoes, home goods, etc. Each of us found something perfect to buy.

And the street is absolutely charming as well. Give it an hour or two. It's worth it to take yourself out of the hustle and bustle of Singapore.

We even came back in the evening to eat at the mexican restaurant!"
,,A gem find.,5.0,,"Sick of luxury brands and mega shopping mall? Check out haji lane-it was a surprise find, full of interesting shops , no mass produced anything, and located next to Arab street (beautiful fabrics stores) and kampong glam (middle eastern flavours galore) - brilliant place to spend the afternoon."
,,Good variety of fashion stores,4.0,,"This place is worth a visit if you're in Singapore, even if you only spend an hour. There is a good variety of fashion stores, and some local designers. The lane itself has a real charm, so worth taking a walk down even if you're not shopping for clothes. Haji Lane is a good reprieve from the megamall luxury brands which to be honest you can pick up in any big city. If you're bored shopping, then there are some really intersting middle eastern eateries a street or two away."
,,Beautiful old building,4.0,,"You can find beautiful old stores here. Don't be fooled though. The exterior may be old but along this road, you can find all the blogshops that sell trendy and fashionable clothes."
,,Lots of small little shops.,4.0,,"I had a great time wandering around Haji Lane exploring different shops and stores. A good mix of modern and traditional, with a very cool atmosphere. If you are in the area, it would be a good place to visit."
,,I love Haji Lane- local designers the place to shop!!!,5.0,,"I absolutely love Haji lane I have lived in Singapore for 2 years and this is the place I would always go and look for different beautiful clothes, sometimes you might find nothing other times plenty!!! A must shop !!!"
,,Some lovely quirky shops here!,4.0,,"Haji Lane is a fantastic little lane in the old Kampong Glam area, it is full of quirky shops where you can buy vintage clothing, a prayer mat or browse book shops. Actually anything Arab or Malay can be found around this area and there is also nice graffiti on the walls which the Singapore Government has allowed to stay.

Haji Lane is extremely popular with the Singapore anti mall crowd and is now world famous for it's hip and trendy shops, even Gwen Steffani visited here. For a totally different shopping and eating experience the whole area is definitely worth a visit.

This is also where I had my first Sheesha pipe. We went up some very rickety stairs, took our shoes off and into a dimly lit room we go. The small room was set out with old lounge suites; it felt like we were in someone’s living room.

There were 4 separate seating areas. Strange place!! Service was pathetic and it took ages for our Peach flavored Sheesha pipe arrived. Gary only lasted about 10 minutes in here, it was stinking hot and he could not stand the smell, so he took off to the pub a couple of doors down.

I did not realize how long these pipes last for, I thought we would only be there about 20 minutes, an hour later it was still going but we had all had enough and went to join Gary at the pub. So that’s my first & last time with a Sheesha Pipe."
,,Haji Lane - Very colourful side street in the Arab Street area,3.0,,"We recently spent a few hours in the Arab Street area and quite enjoyed the small side street known as Haji Lane. This is a very colourful passage lined with restaurants and sort of trendy, boutique fashion, accessories and novelty shops.

We enjoyed taking pictures of the buildings and shops in this area, particularly enjoying the interestingly painted building at the end of Haji Lane. With the right lighting, this makes for very nice photographs and just images to feast your eyes upon while in the area.

In addition to visiting Haji Lane, do make a walk up and down the main Arab Street as well and pay visit to the Sultan Mosque while you are in the area. A quick bite to eat at Singapore Zam Zam for murtabek or another similar restaurant is also worth consideration.

Hint: Unfortunately we found most of shops on Haji Lane closed for business during the hours we visited. If you want to shop here, probably best to come in the later afternoon to evening time when shops seem to be open. Will certainly be cooler that time of day."
,,Love the lane,5.0,,This hip alley is one of my favourite place in Singapore. It's lively and stylish. The building is charming and colourful. The shops are nice with a reasonable price. The lane is in a walking distance to Kampong Glam and Sultan Mosque.
,,A little different side of Singapore,4.0,,"A little street off the main Bugis area, with small little shops and cafes, and a touch of middle eastern charm. Its pretty much active from day till night, with different offerings for everyone."
,,Hip place,4.0,,"This is one of the hipster places in singapore. Its basically just an alley of shops that sell everything from shoes, clothes, bicycle and even flowers. Interesting place as the building structure is kind of a heritage feel but very quirky. U will see many nice small shops, and gravity on walls. Theres also a few places for u to eat and drink. Come here on weekends and u will see all the young stylish singaporeans hanging around."
,,Shopping for something different,4.0,,This place is so much cheaper than the plethora of malls. And it's a new/different environment with some unique offerings. Seemed like there were too many shops closed for a Saturday morning... Maybe cause of CNY still?
,,Love the colourful stores,5.0,,"I love the ambience, the unique stores and restaurant there. It has some unique different touch. Its not too crowded as orchard or bug is street. The stuff they sell also quite unique"
