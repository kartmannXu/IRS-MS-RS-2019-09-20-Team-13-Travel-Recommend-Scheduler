,,Pedestrian bridge,3.0,,It is about 40 m from the ground & is highest pedestrian bridge in Singapore. Just enjoyed the eye catching views of the greenery & skyline.
,,Crowning Glory of the Southern Ridges,4.0,,The Henderson Waves bridge at 36 metres above ground is the highest pedestrian bridge in Singapore. The 274 metre bridge with its undulating wave shape is the crowning glory of the Southern Ridges
,,Great photo moment,5.0,,"Well, it is just a bridge, connecting two parks, so don't expect too much. But the design is beautiful. We had the bridge almost completely alone for the three of us, which was cool, as we took some very nice pics here."
,,Interesting design,4.0,,I would like to have seen this bridge from the road as I reckon it would be pretty speccy but could not face going downhill and then having to come back up to continue our walk! Still it was quite speccy while walking on it and the views from it are great.
,,Interesting View for Walking or Cycling,4.0,,Deserves no more than an hour especially if it's hot and sunny. Try visiting on an overcast day or early morning or late afternoon. Good views.
,,Roller Coaster Walk,4.0,,"Part of a series of connected parks, leading from Telok Blangah Park. A welcome relief for the eyes as you step onto the walkway and be greeted by a series of cascading wooden planks making up the walkway, with twists and narrow perspectives thrown up by the laid planks. Great for some photography moments as a group with the wooden background, or to catch the sunset in the later evening. Memorable, but it do get rather warm in the afternoon. Drink lots of water!"
,,A good walk away from the city,3.0,,We caught a bus out of the city and walked up the steps on the side of the road and followed the signs to the walk. The wave itself is probably 40m long but the walk extends further to a hilltop garden and to the cable car start point. A nice escape from the city.
,,Worth a look,4.0,,If you find yourself near Mount Faber and the cable car to Sentosa you should visit this bridge which is about a 5/8 minute walk from the cable car station. The views are very good and the bridge itself is like no other with its wooden wavy design.
,,Nice extwnded walk,3.0,,"The Bridge is interesting to look at from the ground and there are some good views to be had from on the bridge, however none of them are exceptional. The various resting areas on the bridge have a unique design that allows the correct seating heigh for all sizes of people,

\you might ask why have resting places? well that for me is the real beauty of this site. You can get off the MRT at Harbourfront and start following a trail that ends up in Kent Park. On the way, about 1/3 of the way is Henderson Waves. About 2/3 of the way is the ""Canopy walk"" - a short tree top walk. Also there is a horticultural park along the walk. If you start at one end and walk to the other end it is about 12KM according to my google pedometer. When I got to the end and walked down to the main road, I was surprised to find a single bus (number 10) that took me all the way back to the CBD. A great and enjoyable walk."
,,Amazing place for staying in peace,5.0,,"If you wanna go there, you should go to Vivo mall firstly. After that. Just open your gmap. Then see what no bus you should take. You will pass 2 bus station after turn right. Just stop on 3rd station. Then your journey will begin. Walk on many stairs. It's so tired if you never do it before. But you will feel peacefully after you go reach the bridge. Just sit or stand on see the view. Just feel the air. And it's amazing. I like to go there because it's so calmness for me. There are no many people there. So just enjoy your moments."
,,A bridge over a road,3.0,,"Whilst the bridge itself is a piece of art and there ARE views to the South of Singapore i felt its location was not as spectacular as i had expected. The bridge goes across a very busy road and whilst we were in the tree canopies suspended , all we could smell were car fumes. Worth a look if you are nearby or planning a hike anyway, but not otherwise."
,,"Great Views, amazing structure",5.0,,"Henderson Waves is Singapore’s highest pedestrian bridge; 274 meters long and 36m above Henderson Road. It connects Mt Faber to Telok Blangah Hill Park. One can take a leisurely stroll along this amazing engineering feature and observe the marvellous surrounding views. It is definitely worth a visit, is free and easy to access by public transportation (Red Hill MRT station then a 145 Bus)."
,,An enjoyable walk,5.0,,Well sign posted and information boards along the way. You can walk either way from here above the treetops
,,Afternoon break,3.0,,Wonderful architectural structure. Great sweating walk when you finished the whole stretch. Free parking.
,,Relaxing time with family,4.0,,"You can go there by Bus. I take a bus no. 131 from Viva city, about 5 stops and across the road then upstair to Handerson waves. or you can take Cable car from Sentosa to Mout Faber and walk to there too. I'm not recommend for whom who scared of heights."
,,Nice walk,3.0,,Nice long walk from Telok Blangah to Gillman heights. You should go during the early morning or later part of the afternoon / evening where it is not so hot. Nothing much to see along the way but it is worthwhile to go.
,,Beautiful!!!,5.0,,"Saw this in a Hindi movie the first time and visited it last week. Amazing piece of architecture. Crowded on weekends. Also for the elderly who have difficulty walking, could be an issue. A must see attraction otherwise."
,,Good walk,5.0,,From Kent Ridge Park through Telok Blangah Hill Park to Mount Faber Park and crossing the Henderson Waves bridge which you have beautiful views. Excellent for earlier or later walks. Amazing route to enjoy.
,,Interesting structure,4.0,,Walking along the Southern ridges is a pleasant change from the urban environment. Crossing the Henderson wave gives some good photo opportunities. Can get hot so take water. We caught the cable car from Sentosa to Faber Mountain and then walked around.
,,Great walking along the Southern ridges,4.0,,We walked over the 'wave' as we followed the southern ridge trail. Gives you a different perspective of Singapore. Enjoy
,,"Peaceful location, beautiful views and a calorie burner!",4.0,,"Walk your way up to the cable car (mt faber), via Henderson waves. I would totally reccommend walking this route .... you cannot experience singapore’s green beauty by cars. Walk at your pace from henderson waves , take in the lush greenery amidst the cityscapes and sweat it out while you climb to mount faber peak. It’s a fulfilling walk and fun when you have active kids willing to walk that extra steps before getting to cable car at mt faber"
,,Most Reviewers Are Missing the Point,5.0,,"Henderson Waves is one of the most brilliantly creative concepts I’ve ever encountered anywhere on Earth, and it is utterly unique. But having glanced through a dozen or so reviews, it appears that the majority of out-of-towners reviewing it, are missing the point. It doesn’t matter whether they give the bridge 5 stars or 2: they don’t get it! Some wax rapturous over the view from the bridge, particularly at sunset. Others complain that this bridge-top view isn’t worth the Ridges walk in Singapore heat. One fellow intimates that the unusual construction of the bridge is a clever way of overcoming some knotty engineering problem (perhaps meaning that the bridge bends in an arc from one ridge to another). The unusual construction is certainly creative genius, but I can assure TA readers that it has nothing whatsoever to do with any engineering issue at all.

Yes, the bridge does go over Henderson Road (see Henderson Road photo), and you do take it as the shortest and easiest walk from one ridge to the next. Yes, there is jungle on either side (see Jungle Near and Far photo). I’ll grant you that the view of Reflections on Keppel Bay from the bridge is remarkable, since its futuristic silver lines are in dramatic contrast to the verdant jungle below and the heat-shimmering strait beyond (see Reflections on Keppel Bay photo). Offsetting that, the view looking in the other direction is nothing to enthuse over: you get to see the Bukit Merah district including parts of Henderson Industrial Park: the only conceivable reason anyone would think that view was beautiful was if they owned Henderson Industrial Park (see Bukit Merah photo). You can improve on any of these shots of course, if you throw in a cute companion (see Cute Pedestrian photo). And yes, most important of all, there is that very, very curious way that this bridge was designed and built. As you walk across it, the pedestrian walk and its corresponding railing, for some reason goes up and down, up and down (see Up and Down Up and Down photo). Rather annoying; makes it more difficult to walk across.

But there’s one rather important item related to Henderson Waves that I cannot show you a photo of, and that would be Henderson Waves! Why not? Because no one on Earth can upload a photo of it into TripAdvisor. A video: yes! A still photograph: no; it simply won’t work. The Henderson Waves aren’t invisible. They were there when all these folks submitting their reviews were there, but the reviewers never saw them. Why not? Because, folks, when you are walking across that bridge: YOU are the Henderson Waves! And trust me, if you ever did get a good view of them, you’d agree with me that this is brilliant creativity on steroids!

Would you like to see them? Here’s the easiest way to do it. First, timing is everything: mid-morning on a beautiful weekend day is probably best, since lots of Singaporeans will be walking the Ridges with their families. Catch a taxi or Uber or whatever, and tell the driver you want to get as close to the Henderson Waves bridge as you can, on Henderson Road. They can’t stop directly under it, but they can get you within a reasonably short walk from it. Then, all you do is walk up to where you have a fine view of the bridge: you want to be south of it facing north. Setting your cell-phone onto video would be an excellent idea. Look up at dozens or scores of people above. All those people walking across the bridge, going rhythmically up and down, up and down, up and down. Those folks, up on the bridge: THEY are the Henderson Waves!

(Plan B, by the way, is to walk the Southern Ridges from end to end, but take the stairs down to Henderson Road at the bridge, and then back up again (the harder bit) after you’ve gotten your remarkable video, or at least seen the Waves. If you’re young and spry, Plan B should work for you.)

But remember: having one or two people walking across the bridge when you’re below simply won’t do it: that would be like looking for the waves on a lake during a dead calm. You want to time it to see 30, 40 or 50 of these human waves on the bridge at the same time, rhythmically moving up and down, up and down, up and down. I doubt there’s a Scrooge anywhere on Earth so mean-spirited that he wouldn’t get a hearty laugh out of it, and start slapping his thighs. What a hoot! That, folks, is what put the Waves into Henderson Waves.

p.s. Answering a TA question, I put less than one hour to view the Henderson Waves, but trust me, if you include this as part of the complete Southern Ridges Walk it will take several hours."
,,SimplyBeautiful,5.0,,Henderson waves is an architectural marvel as it has been uniquely designed. One can go for a long walk to Mount Faber and then walk past this bridge. Beautiful !!
,,The most scenic bridge in Singapore!,5.0,,"The Henderson Waves connects from Mount Faber to Telok Blangah Hill. I would recommend you to start from Southern Ridges where there is a treetop walk experience at the Forest Walk and Canopy Walk. Be prepared to take plenty of water, sunblock and wear your comfortable clothes with proper shoes."
,,Visit As Part of the Southern Ridges Walk,4.0,,"I would recommend visiting Henderson Waves as part of the Southern Ridges walk. We started at Hort Park and walked to Mount Faber and enjoyed it immensely for the views and serenity. The Waves are an interesting engineering solution and provided a highlight of the walk. Great views of surrounding area and don't look down off the bridge if afraid of heights!

Like mentioned by others, perhaps not worth travelling to if just viewing this attraction, so include it in the walk."
,,Not worth the effort to walk there,3.0,,Its a bridge with a curve... not much more i can say. Was packed when I was there and very hot so didn't hang around. I guess if you have to go that way then have a look but otherwise I wouldn't worry about putting it on your to-do list
,,Great views! Unique.,5.0,,Walked across as part of the hilltop walk to mount faber. Really unique bridge with great views from both sides. Very hot and hardly any shade so would suggest visiting early evening. Well signposted and a must see - a hidden gem!
,,Peaceful place,4.0,,"Visited here as part of island day tour,an amazing bridge which has some great photo opportunities all in a nice and quiet Park setting,see the locals practice tai chi (if you are lucky) ."
,,Very underrated,5.0,,This is a natural trial near sentosa. Its free and the trial is a little tiring but the view at this bridge at sunset is worth it. Highly recommend the treetop walk also!
,,Great place for a good walk and scenery enjoyment.,5.0,,We really loved the forest walk to the henderson wave. From Forest trails to scenery view. This is sure a hidden gem for foreigners.
,,Good view of sunset,4.0,,"During the evening the bridge lights up and there is a good vantage point to watch the sunset. However, it can get quite dark after 730pm."
,,Leisure walk,4.0,,Beautiful walk through with an awesome view from top of the bridge. Shades of trees 🌳 and flowers too. Lots of trees along the way.
,,"good view, fresh air",4.0,,This place is a cool and breezy place. the view here is astounding. take a lot of picture if u come here as memories. Well recommended for people who wants to walk and exercys just bring a lot of water.
,,Henderson Waves,4.0,,A nicely built bridge with great view. Recommend all tourist to visit this spot if not you are missing out!!
,,Great views; great walks,5.0,,"Henderson Waves is listed separately from the Southern Ridges and the MacRitchie Nature Trail, but in reality they all segue into each other and are very well signposted. A visit to Henderson Waves therefore means other great sights are nearby. Henderson Waves itself is certainly worth visiting. Firstly, it is conveniently located next to a bus stop on Henderson Road, which many buses travel past (I took the 176 and have taken the 145 too but there are many others. The SMRT travel app will keep you right!). Secondly, it is situated at a high elevation and in an area of natural beauty, with terrific views of the park vegetation and wildlife, but also of some of the urban features of Singapore, such as the port. Finally, the Henderson Waves as a structure is pretty cool, with the waves incorporated into the wooden decking but also the bridge structure itself. If you are interested in architecture or civil engineering you will be interested in this! Benches are incorporated into the decking, so you can sit, enjoy the breeze and views. I would allow 60 mins for the Henderson Waves, but maybe 3-4 hours to explore everything the area has to offer, such as the Southern Ridges, etc."
,,Experience tree top walks,4.0,,"Best thing about Singapore we love is there are trees everywhere and many of them are gorgeously huge! the Henderson Waves is actually the pedestrian flyover connecting 2 parks, Mount Faber and Telok Blangah Hill.

We started from the Marang Trail climbed up ladders to the Mount Fabor Park, a short walk then led to the Henderson Waves which looks like Dragon from some angles. View up there is the greenery down there all the way to the sea and Sentosa island. This trail is worth exploring as it goes through 3 parks, two beforementioned parks and the Hort Park at its east end, only that day we went the sun was so bright and hot that our kids would prefer short walk and then went for ice cream!"
,,Brilliant architecture and fantastic views,4.0,,"This long, curvaceous, wooden pedestrian bridge is really worth seeing and walking.
The bridge is part of the beautiful Southern Ridges trail and If you are walking the trail this is probably the best spot for a break as even if it can get a bit crowded the atmosphere is peaceful, happy and chilled.
The views towards the coast with the glass towers of Keppel Bay emerging from the forest are simply spectacular."
,,Unique bridge,4.0,,Nice views of Singapore from the bridge. We have already been to Sentosa Island a couple of times so when we went to the ticket office to get the cable car to Mount Faber it was going to cost $32 each so we opted to get a taxi up the hill which was only $8. It was nice and cool while walking under the tree tops to get to Henderson waves but was very hot once there in the sun. I would recommend going early morning or in the evening when it is cooler. Remember to take water.
,,Away from Shopping and tourist crowd,5.0,,Its a calm oasis in Singapore. Sesy from the usual tourist trail and shopping hub. Get your comfy shoes on and its a great physical activity to explore the Mout Faber trails and Henderson waves. Its also good photo ops too.
,,Excellent design and chill out place,5.0,,The timber finish and having benches along one side for seating is really cool and unique. Nice to walk to and enjoy this high point.
,,Fantastic views,4.0,,"What sensational views up there. It was an extremely hot day, there is little shade on the bridge, so time your visit for the start or end of day. Don’t forget your water! We accessed via the Mount Faber cable car and walked a little further into the Southern Ridges. It is the highest pedestrian bridge in Singapore an looks sensational."
,,Hidden green gem of singapore,4.0,,this park connector that linked up few pocket parks in singapore is awesome. u can enjoy excellent view towards the city and the peaceful side of singapore. The henderson wave bridge itself is a architecture wonder on its own.
,,Worth a side trip,4.0,,"AN architectarily beautiful piece of work, and worth taking a side trip to walk in the dense forest above the congested urbanised city,and along this 200m+ wooden bridge. Take a cab to drop you off by the steep steps on Henderson Rd. Then climb up and stroll over the bridge before headingbavk to Mt Faber for impressive views. Then walk down to Harbourfront MRT to your next destination. Worth a 2 hour diversion."
,,Interesting construction and walk,5.0,,A lovely bridge and following walk - lots of beautiful trees and plants to discover. A walk enjoyed by so many which is good to see. Really not hard at all.
,,Most unusual!,5.0,,"While walking some of the Southern Ridges, of course we walked over the Henderson Waves Bridge. It's a little fascinating to see in real life- I was happy we got to walk over it."
,,Come for the stroll,4.0,,"Henderson Waves makes up park of a cool stroll of Singapore - walk through forests and some amazing pieces of design and architecture. The view from the Henderson Waves is a bit more average, but carry on to Mt Faber in any case.

I'm personally not a big fan of heights but the design of the bridge is clever and you can even take a seat too!"
,,Nice at dusk,3.0,,"Unless it is a clear sunny day (which you don’t want to spend in the rainforest), the view from the bridge is nothing special (compared to Mt Faber etc.). At dusk the view gets nicer and the bridge is nicely lit. Bridge is accessible by stairs from Henderson road or, if you have time, by a nice forest walk from Mt Faber or Southern Ridges Park."
,,Such amazing master piece of architecture.,5.0,,"Well, It was a challenge for me because I don't like height. But it was so beautiful to see that amazing design in a bridge that I just forgot I was afraid.
The bridge and all around has cameras and it made me feel safe.
All the environment and atmosphere is just reenergising and fill us with peace and gratitude.
I didn' t do the full walk because it was to long for me, instead I took the bus 124 in a bus stop at Orchard Road and I asked the driver to let me out at the closest bus stop to the Henderson Waves. He was very friendly and showed me the steps I should go in order to get there. It was a steep step to get to the top, but the bridge was there!

From there I went for a walk in what they call Tree Top Walk.
That was the best experience for me. Not because of the beauty only but because of the feelings it brings. Imagine you walking above the top of the trees...
The bridge is totally safe and you can see under your feet the trees, relax with the birds singing and being surprise with the contrast view between the amazing nature and the city in the background!

For me to come back to Orchard Road and have all MRT stations I just got the bus 166.

Highly recommend !
:)"
,,The Henderson Waves,4.0,,A beautiful view point of the harbor and modern buildings of Singapore. I was able to get some dramatic shots from here.
,,A great place to walk to and to watch the sunset from,5.0,,"There are lots of places to sit, and it's not crowded like many places with great views in Singapore."
,,Great view of the city,4.0,,"A good place to hike and exercise in the afternoon or early morning. I went there with a friend, and the view of the city was worth the long walk."
,,Imaginative,4.0,,A lovely walk and a pleasant way to spend a few hours relaxing in the grounds before reaching the walkway. The waves refer to the wooden walkway undulating. With views.
,,nice day out,5.0,,easy walk for the entire family interesting views bring water and wear comfortable shoes the path is well marked
,,Nice pedestrian bridge,3.0,,"Back again for another visit to the Henderson Waves pedestrian bridge connecting Telok Blangah Hill Park with Mt Faber Park. Always very popular, it's an impressive feat of architecture. Some decent views over the surrounding areas."
,,Check out this Architecture marvel - if u are ready to trek !,3.0,,The bridge is a beautiful architecture marvel - devised for a view of Singapore from the top. One needs great capacity to walk / preparedness to trek ! Don’t forget to carry water bottle as there is no provision of eating supplies . There are dispensing machines - but they weren’t working when I went. You will get different views during the day n night / as night is all lit up !
,,Fresh air / Easy Trails,4.0,,Trails to Henderson Waves are relatively easy to walk. Accessible for kids with kick scooters and nice view of the area! Calm peaceful place to be overlooking the sentosa area.
,,Nature,4.0,,"This wooden bridge belongs to a long walk, between canopy and forest walks, which represents a several hour ballad in the rather surprising natured Singapore. Do not forget water supply"
,,an architectural masterpiece,4.0,,"This is part of the trail up on mount Faber and definitely worth seeing, great views of the area, very high up, one of a kind."
,,Henderson Waves @ Southern ridge Singapore,4.0,,A good walk which takes from Labrador Park to Hort Park.. Ideal for a weekend morning or evening stroll.
,,Worth it in a way.,4.0,,"The view was amazing.
A fabulpus place to take pictures.
Windy and cooling.
So h go up to henderson waves and then you walk all the eag to harbour front Mrt.
Will also pass the Cablecar station.
So basically, if you like hiking, then thats great for you! BUT if youre like me! Then its hell.
I was whining the whole time cause u know i basically hate any form of exersice especially hiking and running.

Yeah.
Worth it in a way.
So it was an experiences.
A great one"
,,Interesting,5.0,,This is part of the Mt Faber walk. An interesting structure and nice walk. Make sure you have water and hat as its out in the open with no cover.
,,amazing view at Henderson waves,4.0,,Going there need an effort.. you better bring some water and good health as the stairs and the walking pad at Mount Faber may hurt your leg a bit. but kids enjoy the scenery and the architecture.
,,"Great Art, Architecture and Designed!!!",5.0,,"Henderson Waves Bridge is such a cool, unique wooden Architectural Designed connect to Mount Faber.

I was very enjoyable walking around the bridge and happy to watch all the natural forest and enjoy the sunset views was a very great experience.

One of the best spot outdoor in Singapore to enjoy for jogger or couples and family and now become a favorite place for practice photography.

The best way to get there for me is to ride the cable car from HarbourFront station to Mount Faber station then walk about 700-meter was very convenience."
,,Needs better sign posting,3.0,,This is a nice walk and something different to do once you get to Mt Faber but the signage is confusing. We ended up taking a very convoluted path by following the signs when we really only wanted a quick look see before taking the cable car over to Sentosa.
,,A walk in the park singapore style,5.0,,We started on the Southern Ridges trail at Horton Park before heading for the Bridge. It is not s strenuous walk but take plenty of water as you will work up a sweat. This is my number 2 favourite place in Sing after the Botanical Gardens. We made it a day and walked to Mt Faber and took the cable car to Sentosa to stroll the beaches. NB The Maranga trail just closed so it wasnt possible to walk the trail to the Harbourview MRT. The Forrest canopy walkway and the Bridge are stunning: beautiful views and clever engineering. Great that Singapore is investing in these walking experiences.
,,Awesome work of art!,5.0,,"Who would think there's a hidden gem in this small red dot. If you're thinking of a nice way to sweat, trek the Southern Ridges trail. The Henderson Waves is just one of the many stops you'll love."
,,With grown up children,4.0,,"The sky looked pretty clear for a walk up Mt Faber via Maranda Trail up to the Watch out point. The view was breath taking on both the City and the Ocean view.

We stopped at the top for a refreshing drink before ringing the bell to chime out the sound of happiness for all.

After which we headed towards Henderson Wave Bridge. Many were already there to catch the sunset! What a sight!!!

As many commented in their posts it’s worth the hike."
,,"Amazing view, breathtaking architecture",5.0,,"The walk up may be slightly tiring but it's worth it when you get to the top. For the best experience, avoid going in the daytime as it gets pretty hot. I went in the wee hours of the day (around 4am) and it was amazing to see the sleeping city from the top."
,,Amazing Views from the top,5.0,,Scenic views! And a great location for exercising or just chilling at night. Place at night isn't too dark so it's quite safe
,,Unique design with beautiful view of the city,4.0,,As the name suggests this bridge is designed in shape of waves. It offers beautiful view of the city and is the highest bridge in Singapore. It connects two parks and is quite long. It is not very famous but must be included in the itinerary. You can click some nice pictured here.
,,Henderson Waves,5.0,,"Henderson Waves is one of the lesser know tourist attractions in Singapore. After visiting this magnificent and different bridge i would recommend that it be on your itenary if you want to do something different. This connects the Telok Blangah Park to Mount Faber.
Very easy to reach via cab from Vivo City or Harbourfront. No bus or public transport goes all the way upto the park. Cab is the best option. A short climb to the bridge and you are there. Walk, look at the view across of the Sentosa,water, high-rises, greenery all around. I went in the daylight but it looks beautiful when lights come on. Take time to sit, relax with loved ones. The walk to Mt Faber is long. Alternatively you can comedown a stairway onto the road. There is a bus stop right there which can take you to nearest bus depot and MRT.Cabs will be difficult to find.
A beautiful experience for sure!"
,,beautiful,4.0,,"already won some awards for the architecture, another link between the parks..specifically mt Faber and telok blangah park. beautiful view, lighted but do play safe at night as the ends are dimly lit only."
,,So cool & unreal!!!,5.0,,"Henderson Waves is easy and longish to access via Hort Park & the rest of the Southern Ridges... or a short stroll from the top of Mt Faber. Henderson Waves is quite short, so you'll be inclinded to double back & walk it again. Obviously an amazing photo opportunity!!!"
,,A unique Piece of Singapore Worth visiting,5.0,,"We visited Henderson Waves just after dusk, catching a bus from the city. It's a bit of a walk from the bus but you are rewarded by quite a unique experience and amazing views of Singapore (though you can't see Marina Bay Sands, but there's more to Singapore than that!). Well worth visiting."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"After walking from Holt Park we were amazed by this structure an undulating elevated walkway constructed of wood , well worth the walk to experience ."
,,One of the coolest things in SG,5.0,,"I have been here twice. And yes, I still love this place a lot. Nevertheless I haven’t got any chance to run here at the moment. Will do sometime:)"
,,Henderson Waves,5.0,,A breath taking view of the City can be seen from here. A good place to walk and enjoy the nature.A good long walk from the Hort Park with rest places in between.
,,Beautiful sunset,5.0,,"Visited Henderson Waves bridge with combinations of Tiong Bahru MRT & Bus 195 combination.

Steep climb to Henderson Waves Bridge.

Great photo opportunities.

Good for instagrammers.

Sunset is even more beautiful.

However didn’t like the idea of people with their pets walking in open, my wife is afraid of .

Good for a one time visit.

Complete map is available to explore the Southern Ridges.

Pro tip: visit around 5:30 pm in the evening to enjoy evening sun and the sunset."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Loved this bridge esp. in the early morning on a Saturday when there is less people. There are also nice photo opportunities from the bridge. Good place to relax too.
,,So nice,5.0,,We went to Henderson Waves on a Sunday afternoon with kids and both kids and us loved it. I suggest you arrive to Mount Faber Cable Car by taxi and then walk 450 m to Henderson Waves. You will enjoy very nice views of Singapore- stay in tune with nature and listen to birds. You can carry on and complete the entire Forest Walk including Tree Top walk.
,,Nice view from higher !! Far away noisy & traffic.,4.0,,If you visit Singapore for long days should be come there enjoy incredible view from top. Quite private place for dating. But higher show have to climbing stairs about 10-15mins
,,Peaceful & Pleasant,5.0,,"We had a lovely wander through the walks which all seamlessly join one another, do as many or as few as you like, we got a taxi to the cable car stop and walked the walks, we went early to avoid the midday heat, very clean, loo stops along the way & drinks vending machines to help keep you hydrated, very clean. A great escape from the hustle & bustle"
,,An Oasis of calm,5.0,,"We took the cable car up from the harbour front and then made the short walk (450m) to the waves. Lovely views of the city and very calm. However, I think the best view would be from underneath the bridge or from the side when you can really see the whole design. Enjoyable walk even for people that are not that fit."
,,Go jogging here!,5.0,,"I have visited Singapore many times and found out it's always been about shopping. So this time I managed to do other things rather than just go shopping in this country. I came up with an idea of hunting for a jogging track and then I found this hidden place! This is really the place if you want to escape the crowd of the city!

I'd recommend you to go jogging here, cos it's just the perfect place. First, you're gonna have to walk from the Harbourfront MRT around 2 min and then take the entrance to Mount Faber Park. In order to get to Henderson Waves, you have to walk inside the Mount Faber Park. Don't worry, it's free! Follow the signs that will lead you to Henderson Waves. Near the bridge, they also have some gym equipment that you can use for free!"
,,Architecture and Green Spaces,4.0,,"The Henderson Waves is a modern bridge linking areas of green spaces as part of the Southern Ridges walk. It's a clever design better observed from the main road or a distance to truly appreciate the design. It is a lovely wide space that invites you to linger, sit and enjoy the outside space and the views and then to wander on to the next green space. Take plenty of water with you would be my advice."
,,great architecture linking nature paradises,5.0,,I visit Henderson Waves almost on all my Singapore visits because they are a part of a great natural treasury within a vibrant city. I went up to Mount Faber first and than with a little bit up and downs toward Henderson Waves. There are many place where you can rest and enjoy the scenery.
,,Wear your walking shoes,5.0,,"So beautiful! You will want to explore the entire park. city views and amazing greenery, would visit again!"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Henderson Waves is a beautiful bridge with gorgeous architecture. It is easily accessible (after climbing 50-60 stairs) from the main road. The rest of the trail is also nice!
,,beautiful bridge,3.0,,"I enjoyed our brief time here walking up and down this stunning piece of artwork. The only negative was that the bridge was so short that it almost wasn't worth the effort traveling there to traverse the bridge. In any event, I'm happy we came here an it's worth a visit to take some amazing photos. However, be forewarned the bridge itself takes only 10-15 minutes to traverse and may not be worth it. However, if you do visit, bring your camera for some impressive photos or better yet, bring your hiking shoes for some long hikes in their walking trails."
,,Beautiful bridge,4.0,,"So, to clear up confusion, Henderson Waves is a bridge over Henderson Road, and forms a small, connecting part of the Southern Ridges walk.

But to call it a bridge isn’t doing it justice - it’s also an artwork. It’s the highest pedestrian bridge in Singapore. Built of timber, it gently rises to 78m at the western end. It’s also lit up at night, but I’m not sure that’s worth a special trip.

There are plenty of buses to Henderson Road (Google Maps will help you here), and then a stiff climb up steps to get to the bridge itself, or walk on from Mount Faber. The Southern Ridges themselves are a lovely countryside walk, and a great way to escape the madness of Singapore City."
,,Good views and well worth the trip,5.0,,"Visited here by bus from the city. Excellent views from the bridge, which is unique. Bit of a climb up the steps to get there, but it is accessible by road if you want to take a taxi.
The bridge is very easy to walk on, suitable for the wheelchair/strollers, but again only on the bridge, the descent is steep."
,,jungle in the city,5.0,,"We got the bus here as its a little way outside the centre which was cheap.
Starting at the unique henderson waves we ventured quite far along the trail and had a lovely calm few hours.
Henderson waves itself its just a fantastic bridge, but its in a park which is connected by all different pieces of art/architecture which takes you through the park and through whats like a jungle in the city. I cant remember the name of this part but its metal walkway taking you high up through the trees and its just fantastic really great to be in this jungle like space right in the city!"
,,Architectural wonder,5.0,,"Just a bridge but so much more! Worth a walk, supposed to be lovely at night but just as impressive during the day."
,,Peaceful Walk,5.0,,"I came from Indonesia, so in terms of beautiful natural scenery this park is not so mesmerizing, but of course what I do so admire is how they manage it.

The bridge is beautiful, it’s clean, quiet, and relaxing. And what I love the most is the contrast between the tranquility in this park and the bustling businesses within tall buildings that you could still see from inside the park."
,,Walked the four parks in a row starting from Mount Faber,4.0,,"I started at the Vivo City shopping mall, walked up to mount Faber, passed over the Henderson waves (great!) onto the next park (Telok Blangah), and kept going over the Forest Walk, the Alexandra Arch, Floral Walk, Horti Park up to the Canopy Walk (parts were closed). Took a nearby MRT back - hiked about 10 km's. Great experience."
,,Treetops,5.0,,This is the loveliest walk as you really are up in the tree canopy! As a wheelchair user it’s great to do the same as everyone else. The views are spectacular and it’s free from most of the traffic noise. Little shelters are available if it’s too hot or it rains. Toilets too though not many. Magnificent!
,,enjoy panoramic view of Singapore,4.0,,"How to get to Henderson waves bridge?
take MRT to harbourfront station, walk out of vivo city. then catch bus no 131 to Henderson road. after 4 or 5 stops (couldn't recall), get off and you can see the bridge. there's a signage to the bridge. it was a great architecture, designed for pedestrian walk/jog or even enjoy the view of Singapore. a good spot for healthy lifestyle whereby people can trekking at mount Faber then jogging along the bridge."
,,singapore delight,5.0,,One of the many amazing attractions within the southern ridges. This photogenic spot is popular for a reason
,,Popular For A Reason,5.0,,This is an outstanding section of The Southern Ridges trail. It is beautiful as a sculpture as well as functional as a bridge. Popular with lovely Amas etc (Filipino maids) at weekends. Provides amazing views across the city 360 deg. Nice cool breeze at most times.
,,Full of surprises,5.0,,Singapore has so much to offer and this small city never fails to surprises you as there is something on every corner to see . The design of this bridge is truly amazing
,,Great for Late Night Dates,4.0,,"You can enjoy the beautiful view of the city and the fresh air while having dinner on this beautifully designed suspended bridge. It’s also perfect for a morning run or walk if you are staying nearby. I recommend you visit late in the afternoon. If you wish to hike the whole The Southern Ridges, you can go earlier so you can finish your hike here just before sunset."
,,Artistic and original wave-like canopy drawn amongst the treetops,5.0,,"Walk and dream at the same time, listening to the birds, feasting your eyes on the views. Such an innovative approach to walking through the beautiful flora and fauna of Singapore!"
,,Nice place to view Singapore,5.0,,"If you love to walk, this will be a nice place to visit. You can choose to walk to mount faber peak for the cablecar and more views (views are free)."
,,"Great view, futuristic construction",5.0,,We spent an afternoon around mount faber and crossed the waves. They offer a good view point on the CBD and sentosa island as well as the natural park surrounding. Recommenced
,,The Unique Bridge with Breathtaking Scenery,4.0,,"This bridge seems to be a new tourist spot in Singapore. We must climb many stairs to heading to the top, not recommended for old people because it is quite tiring. When we get to the top we can see the unique wave-shaped bridge, from here we can see Singapore from above. In addition the atmosphere here is also very beautiful with the many trees that exist. The best time to get here is when morning and evening. Its location is adjacent to the harbourfront so if you traveling to Singapore by ferry and have a bit of free time before returning home, you can take it to come here."
,,A very interesting spot.,4.0,,Only chanced upon this bridge and found the architecture interesting as well as watching the morning Tai Chi take place.A good attraction before taking the cable car to Sentosa.
,,Interesting bridge,4.0,,Lovely and interesting structure at the top of Mount Faber . It allows a nice scenic view of Singapore as well
,,Great view!,5.0,,"Went to Habourfront MRT and walked out from exit D. A short walk from the station and we were greeted by an amazing view! I would recommend going early in the morning or at night as it can get quite hot around noon. After walking to the bridge, we walked down to a bus stop below ""Bef Telok Blangah Hts"", where there are buses to back to Habourfront station."
,,Sunset in Henderson Wave Bridge,5.0,,"Me and wife came to Henderson Wave Bridge at the sunset to get a better view. The light switch on when nearly evening to make a view better. Many people hang out around evening for some occasion, such as walking, jogging, yoga etc."
,,Best place to see Singapore night skyline!! Must also try the Forest Walk!,5.0,,"Henderson Waves is not just a waving bridge by itself, but linked to the Forest Walk of Southern Ridges. Must start from the Forest Walk bridge besides The Interlace Condo then ends up at Henderson Waves. Good to see the scene from top in daytime but very hot in daytime. Best to see at night with only the bridges' walkway lights. Though whole surroundings are very dark but you can truly appreciate the beauty of night Singapore's scenes. You can stay on top of Henderson Waves bridge for as long as you like at night."
,,Amazing Treetop Crossing,5.0,,"The Henderson Waves is an amazing sculptural bridge structure that connects Telok Blangah Hill Park to Mount Faber.
The highest pedestrian bridge in Singapore is worthy of visiting and walking across, taking in elevated views of Telok Blangah and beyond. That it connects with Mt Faber extends the walk to a visit to another of Singapore's favourite tourist destinations. Visitors can get marvellous city and harbour views from the top of Mt Faber as well as take the cable car across to Sentosa.
Henderson Waves is part of the walkways system in the Southern Ridges, 10km of greenery extending from Labrador Park to Kent Ridge Park, to Hortpark, to Telok Blangah Hill Park, to Mt Faber.
More information and directions can be obtained from theNational Parks website."
,,Beautiful views - great walk,5.0,,"A must see when visiting Singapore. The views are amazing, walking high above the trees. I got the cable car from Sentosa Island and then walked from Mount Fabre over the Henderson waves. This walk can be very lengthy so comfy shoes are a must!"
,,"Peaceful, great views",5.0,,"Just a little out of central downtown, but not far and accessible by bus. Just walk and view over the bridge. Also connected to several other walking trails and parks."
,,Breathtaking views,5.0,,"It’s just a pedestrian bridge. But God, those views, especially at sunset. Can’t believe that such experience is available here at Singapore, which mostly consists of concrete jungle.

For comfort’s sake (or for those who isn’t quite athletic like me), you can actually take a cable car from HarbourFront to Mt. Faber cable car station, and walk from there to Henderson Waves. Costs you more than taking a bus (18 SGD) but the views from the cable car is worth capturing."
,,Good walking trails in a city state,4.0,,"Unbelievable to find nature trails in an urban landscape. Started our walk at VivoCity Harbourfront MRT station. Follow signs to exit D, Marang Trail, a moderate to challenging 15 minute hike up to Mt Faber. Views are fantastic up there. On the hinterland you can see the city skyline and public housing. On the coastal front, you can see Sentosa and the various islands. Enjoy the scenery! Walk further and you’ll come to The Jewel, a restaurant, as well as Mt Faber cable car station. An easy walk along the footpath. Be careful of traffic. You will then come to a fork (which is actually a loop). Taking the left fork is 700m to Henderson Waves, while the right is 300m.
We took the longer route. Reaching a Danish Seamen Church, we turned right round the loop. Within a few steps, we came to the big sign ‘Henderson Waves’. A beautiful man-made bridge structure. It was very cooling and slightly breezy.
Continuing the walk, you will come to Forest Walk, a metal trail that brings you into the forest canopy. You come very close to nature here, hearing the various birds and insects, plus seeing squirrels. We ended our walk here and returned via the same route after 2.5 hrs. The trail continues further if you wish to walk more.
Didn’t think that Singapore a city state still has trails that are so close to nature. A good afternoon spent with family."
,,Nothing Fantastic,2.0,,Nothing Fantastic just a bridge to look at cars below LOL! very short. I went for the first & last time.
,,Good walk,5.0,,"Enjoyed a good workout on this walk, it was hot but there are shaded areas along the way to stop and have a drink. Returned the same way to Mt. Faber and had a cool drink at the restaurant."
,,Wonderful Architecture with Beautiful Sunset,5.0,,"When you travelled to Singapore often, you'll run out places to explore. Thanks to instagram account like visit_singapore or exploresingapore I've managed to found this hidden gem located on far west of Singapore. I cannot talk about the history or the purpose of the bridge (Blimey, I've missed to read it at the beginning of the bridge). But if you're looking for something free and beautiful in expensive Singapore. Or if you just looking for some sweat, go here.

The bridge itself was only 300m long. And there are stairs (don't worry) to go up. You can go here using bus since the bus stop is right under the bridge, google the bus number! Or you can ride MRT to Harborfront then change to the bus.

Tips: go here when sunset comes. It is busy with runners, but the scenery was beautiful. You can see the city of Singapore at the bridge. And don't forget to bring mineral water or snacks and enjoy the view."
,,Sunset,5.0,,"A good place to be with the nature, away from the hustle and bustle of the city.
Most people come during sunset, not just to watch the light being lit up at night, but a good place to chill, hang out with friends or go on a date with your love ones."
,,"OK to visit, mostly for the views...",4.0,,"Visually striking wave-shaped over 100ft high pedestrian bridge connecting Mount Faber Park to Telok Blangah Hill Park... Decent views, nice to relax... Combine it it with a walk from the Southern Ridges...

Nice to see but not a must. The best time is late afternoon, close to sunset when it is lit... very popular with Instagram selfie crowd... Watch out for selfie sticks;)"
,,A wonderful trek in the lap of nature,5.0,,"Singapore has many hidden gems and Henderson Waves is one of them. It is a wooden bridge at a height of 68 meters and has an unusual shape that gives the feeling of waves. Singapore is one of the rare cities where you can enjoy walking through a dense tropical forest right in the middle of the city. A 2.5 kms long tree top walk is one of my favourite activities during every trip to Singapore.
A hour long downpour in the morning had the desired cooling effect and we headed for this trek. It is a thoroughly enjoyable climb that takes you through a forest track and offers spectacular view of the city from the highest point at the Henderson Waves."
,,Beautifully designed,4.0,,"It is located right under a bus station. I climbed a short way up to reach one side of the bridge. It has places to sit on, so we took some rest while taking photos furiously there."
,,A much needed 415th review,4.0,,"I concur with the other 414, but would also like to add that the bridge is much more stable looking once you walk underneath and see that the beautiful woodwork is held sturdy by steel beams. Do you concur? I concur."
,,"wonderful way to chill out, unwind and work out",4.0,,beautiful and u can step in or out at many points along the way links up many places along the way and i always love going back in teh evening and in teh day too
,,Awesome trek!,5.0,,"An awesome place in Singapore to trek or just simply exercise through walking/jogging. It is free and easy to get to, by all kinds of transport. You can start it from the subway station HarbourFront, and walk through Mount Faber park towards the other end. Many entry and exits depending on how far you want to go.

A definite recommendation for anyone visiting and wanting an experience in a ""created nature"" walk."
,,Best part of the Southern Ridges walk,4.0,,"Although walking the bridge only takes 5 minutes, it makes a good break from the city for a couple of hours if it is included in a walk from Kent Ridge Park to Mount Faber Park. It is also the highlight of the walk. Surprisingly, there were not that many visitors when I did the walk.
Recommended to start at Kent Ridge Park, and walk to Mount Faber Park as it is downhill. Then walk down to the VivoCity mall that has an excellent food court and views of Sentosa from the roof.
Walk takes almost 2hours."
,,Revisit for a jog,4.0,,Unique structure especially during night. But the best thing is Henderson makes a perfect stop when hiking to Faber Park or beyond. There's always a crowd but is fine. Always look forward to come back.
,,Waves with 3 kids,4.0,,"This is a stunning piece of modern architecture and fun to walk across. We went shopping in Vivocity and then took the cable car up to the Mount Faber station. You then just go down to the road behind the station and head left following the signs for the Henderson Waves. It is well sign posted and a 10 minute slow walk (about 450m). You have to turn right shortly and follow a meandering road downhill. Keep to the path on the right and you'll soon come to a very clear signed entrance to the bridge.
The kids loved running up the sloped sides on the wave sections of the bridge and we spend a good 30 minutes here. At the opposite end there is a path on the left that tales you down the hill through some exercise areas with sit-up tables, pull up bars etc. Eventually you come to a car park and from here we got an Uber cab back to our hotel. You can continue the forest walk much further if you want to."
,,Nice walk,4.0,,"I started my walk from Telok Balangah road, walked up to the Mount Faber peak and then over the Henderson Waves along the tree top walk. I wouldn't specifically visit the henderson waves but it is a beautiful point along a lovely set of trails."
,,Amazing piece of architecture,5.0,,"This bridge is unusual and fantastic!!
It connects two parks together while providing views of Sentosa. It is kept clean apart from a few cats. The parks provide some information and walking trails which we wished we could have done but ran out of time.
There are warnings of wild monkeys but we saw none.

The bridge itself has a sheltered area to sit however it is crowded.
Well worth going!"
,,Something cute,3.0,,Something left for wandering around when you have done the major sightseeing. The bridge itself can be done within 5 minutes. The wave is special and I like the climb (steep) and the park adjacent to it might be nice while I couldn't visit properly as it was raining.
,,Nice place for picnic,5.0,,"Go there while sunset. Beautiful singapore view from the bridge. The bridge itself has beautiful lights. Don't forget to bring some foods and drinks. You can have picnic there. Just sit on the bridge, they also provide bench on the waves."
,,Groovy Man,5.0,,Got here at night with my son and realized it is overrun with lovers watching the lights of the city twinkle on. We walked it anyway and thoroughly enjoyed the sleek architecture.
,,dont waste your time,2.0,,"its bridge for walk and you can seat on for relax, reading, and sun painting. i recommended for art people only"
,,Picture perfect spot,5.0,,"It's free. It has an amazing 360 view. Great place for couples, family and friends. Perfect place for photo shoots. It's quite high so people who might have heart problems may have a hard time going up."
,,Bridge with nice views,3.0,,"The bridge spans Henderson Rd and joins Mt Faber Park with Telok Blangah Hill Park. The only real reason for visiting it is if you are walking the Southern Ridges. It does have some quite nice views, and is lit up at night. You can access it by car if you don't want to walk the trail. It is a suspension bridge with some quite nice curves if you are interested in architecture. It has little to no shade during the day but is not a long walk so if you are coming by car about 10 to 15 minutes would be enough time to see everything. It has a resident population of cats, which does not do much for wildlife watching."
,,The architectural bridge that offers the beauty of the city skyline,5.0,,"It is very interesting to visit this bridge at night, the scene of the city decorated with lights become one of its charms. Seeing this bridge burning among the darkness of the park also makes it an interesting photo object"
,,"Design, architecture, scenery and nature!",4.0,,"If you enjoy good design and walking, you'll like the walk through Henderson Waves. Unique suspension bridge - good views and interesting construction/angles - take time to enjoy that aspect of it. Make sure to also look back on your walk as the views and angles change. TAKE WITH YOU: hat/sunscreen or umbrella as it is open and exposed so it is HOT in the sun and you will be wet if it's rainy. Take water to drink as the walk is part of a longer walk in the Southern Ridges Park network. Sit for some time in one of the curves or benches and enjoy the view over Singapore. Note that it is mostly on an angle, so walking West you'll be going uphill, walking east you'll be going down."
,,Part of the Southern Ridges Trail,4.0,,"The Henderson wave bridge is a 36m suspension bridge, which connects the Mount Faber and Telok Blangah Hill Parks. My partner and I visited this as a component of the larger Southern Ridges Walk – a hiking trail which spans across 3 adjacent parks which exist on the southern ridge of Singapore (Mount Faber > Telok Blangah Park > Kent Ridge Park). Opened in 2008 the Henderson wave bridge is famous due to its unique architecture which resembles a twisting and curving wave.
Overall we found this formed a decent attraction on the Southern Ridges Trail. I felt it wasn’t spectacular and if you are visiting Singapore for the first time I would say this isn’t a ‘must see’. Like the Southern Ridges Trail I feel it’s high rating is more reflective of the fact it is free rather than exceptional."
,,So hard to get a full shape of the bridge.,3.0,,"Good place for exercise, fresh air, but it's so hot in the noon. You better come here early in the morning."
,,Well designed for a lazy day,5.0,,"not exactly, you have to climb up to this place, which is a 20 min climb at best. then you can chill and do nothing while taking in a great view, or sunset!"
,,unique pedestrian bridge,3.0,,"go there in the morning and bring bottes of water and towels with you . We took the train from CityLink Mall and got off at Redhill and from REdhill to the bridge was about a 2 km (?) walk. We didn't stay there long cuz it's noon time ,it was too hot!"
,,Worth for scenery,4.0,,"Went there early in the morning, enjoy walking and kinda trekking like the local. We stopped for photos taking and sitting under the wave shape roof along the walkways. I like it and will be back for my morning jogging again."
,,Nice place to walk but very hot in the day,3.0,,"Unless you love the sun, you will not want to come here at noon. You are pretty much exposed to the elements and there's nothing much to see except the unusual structure of the bridge"
,,A great bridge with a great view,4.0,,"We started from Hort Park, walked on the famous Tree Top Walk, children were on their scooter, they had so much fun. Then maybe another 1K+ walking on shaded track. It was a very clear and hot day, great view from the Henderson Wave bridge. We walk all the way back to Hort Park carpark, it was around 8900 steps. Good family work out!"
,,Beautiful architecture and great views; must-do!,5.0,,"I love the Henderson Waves. It's a long green stretch for walking. You come across well-designed pedestrian bridges, walk between the treetops, and have great views. Highly recommended!"
,,Jungle in the City,5.0,,"Easily reachable by the excellent local bus service, the Henderson Waves is a free experience, apart from some shoe leather and a bit of sweat. Good signage and a clean environment makes for an interesting few hours, views are spectacular, although looking down through the galvanized walkways may not be for the faint hearted. Plenty of stopping off points, and inexpensive soft drinks and water are available near the top."
,,Just beautiful!,5.0,,We spent ages here taking some great photos of the bridge and the views from either side. Very very beautiful and our favorite part of the Southern Ridges walk!
,,Must see! Amazing!,5.0,,This and the Southern Ridges was by far our favorite thing in Singapore. It is so cool to walk in the jungle with sky scrapers poking out and the walkway is gorgeous.
,,A nice place to hang out,4.0,,"The Henderson Waves is reachable by bus 131/145 at the After/Before Tlok Blangah Heights bus stop. From the bus stop, you have to take the steep stairs, and then do a slight walking up. The stairs and the walk might be tiring, but rest assured it was worth it. The bridge offers beautiful scenes of greener Singapore uncovered by skyscrapers. I visited Henderson Waves at dusk and lots of locals (couples, families, groups of friends) were hanging out there. You can even lay down under the canopy and feel the breeze from the gap of the wooden platform beneath. I spent an hour just laying there to relax my feet from walking all day long. Overall, it was a very nice place."
,,Definitely a cool place to visit if you're here more than a few days,4.0,,"I love Henderson Waves; then again, I live here. It is indeed a ""hidden gem"" that nearly every Singaporean and expat knows about, but it doesn't make the architecture and instagramming opportunities any less exciting.

If you've just gone through some heartache or a bad breakup, avoid at ALL COSTS! You will be overcome by young happy couples and open PDA, but that's all part of what makes the place charming.

If you are visiting Singapore for a few days only, you can give this a miss and not have missed out on much, but if you're here longer, need something to do, or live here, check it out and enjoy some of Singapore's coolest architecture set against a lush backdrop."
,,MUST VISIT WHEN U IN SPORE!,5.0,,This place is really recommended to visit. Really relaxing and i spent 2 hours here because this place is simply amazing. To go here just take bus no 131 or 145 from harbour front station
,,Wonderful walk,5.0,,"If you're looking for something a bit different in Singapore then the Southern Trails walk is it. An amazing trail that leads through the treetops, over bridges & up to Fabre point with great views all the way."
,,Henderson Waves,5.0,,"Top Tip go early morning as it can get very hot and humid, take plenty of water..you can take the trail through the forest on the walkways or on the ground. It is located very near the cablecar.Just past the forest you will come to some gardens well worth a visit and then you carry on for a treetop walk. You can also get drinks at the gardens. It took my 17yr old daughter and I 3 plus hours there and back. You can pickup a Taxi from the Cablecar back to Hotel."
,,Fabulous elevated walkway with great views and not too wild!,4.0,,"I like to park at Hort Park (off Alexander Rd) and do the park connector walks from there through Henderson waves, down to Vivo city and along the marina back up to Hort Park. It's a wonderful, quiet walk of around 9km with many options for coffee / tea stops along the way in Vivo and at the hawker centre opposite. I like to stop for a delicious, energising ginger tea at Mustafas' stall at the Hawker Centre! NOTE for the first 5km or so there is no rain cover, so bear this in mind when selecting where to walk!"
,,Amazing view of the area - worth it just for that,4.0,,"To start with, we started our trek to the Henderson Waves from the Mount Faber Cable Car building. We followed signs to Henderson Waves. I had not really planned this out and I estimated it was a 15 minute walk. It was not. It was more like a 40 minute hike through some steep, hilly, densely forested area. By the time we got to the elevated bridge we were hot, tired, and achy. But the view of the Henderson Waves and the surrounding area make up for it. The view out the ocean was beautiful. To see all of the dense greenery really reminds you how Singapore is a nature loving city. They truly value their green spaces and preserve them where ever they can.
It was a hike, but it was worth it.
We went in July. Bring bug spray. Wear a hat. Make sure you have water. I didn't see any bathrooms, we used the facility at Mt. Faber. We took the Cable Car back to Harbourfront to get dinner, although Mt. Faber did have a nice restaurant."
,,nice but can be missed,3.0,,"a very nice designed pedestrian bridge with connecting a canopy walk and the mount Faber walk. Nothing special, but it is free to visit and like taking a stroll in nature. If you want to do both walks and the bridge you need good condition and take somehing to drink and eat."
,,A 'hidden' attraction,5.0,,"I have been lucky enough to visit Singapore a few times but had no idea this beautiful jungle area existed. I walked from the Harbor Front MRT to Mt Faber and along the Henderson Waves and greatly enjoyed the lush vegetation, the peace, and the different side of Singapore it represents. The Henderson Waves are very impressive in themselves but take the time to make them part of the overall experience. Take plenty of water."
,,Great Walk,5.0,,A lovely walk among the tree tops. Beautiful views and exceptional craftsman skills to build a bridge like this.
,,Gateway to Great Walks,5.0,,"This is probably the highest pedestrian overhead bridge in Singapore, and the most beautiful.
If you face south, you could see the almost mesmerising architectural wonder that is Reflections at Keppel Bay.
If you head east, you could walk your way to Mount Faber. If you walk west, you would be walking high on top of the forest, on a almost 2km Tree-top Walk called the Forest Walk towards the Alexander Arch.
The bridge floor feels like a giant boardwalk and there are seats for you if you are tired.
Of course at night, the view is even more beautiful, it's cool and the walks are simply not to be missed."
,,Interesting bridge and views in the middle of a beautiful park system,4.0,,"I travelled here on foot during a long run from downtown up to Kent Ridge park, Hort Park and on to Mt Faber. Henderson Waves is in between the Southern Ridges and Mt Faber.

I was there late in the morning on a weekday and I practically had the bridge to myself.

Some of the pathways leading to and from the bridge are fantastic. The Forest Walk at the west end of the park was my favorite.

It's going to be a pretty good climb no matter which end you come from so plan hydration appropriately."
,,Nice walk with good views,4.0,,"Great walk with some nice views, none of the views are the typical Marina Bay views or of the landmarks in that area. The walk is relatively quiet and peaceful, there are warnings about wild monkeys but we didn't see any...however instructions are given about how to avoid and move along peacefully if confronted."
,,Beautiful!!,5.0,,"I went here to take photos for a photoshop and though it was crowded, I got some really good photos. The view was amazing and the walk there was long but beautiful! Definitly recomend it!!"
,,Re-energizing walk to a beautiful view..!!,4.0,,"Its part of National Parks, parks connector network southern ridge. Easy way to access the trail is from alexandra road opp spjain bus stop and then take the bridge to the start of the trail. Its almost 2.5 kms uphill trail that will navigate through the bushes, greeneries, mildly dense forest finally passing through henderson waves ending in Mount faber cable car boarding point. It's mindblowing to see the connectivity and the view from hill top overlooking harbour. Since the trail is a strenuous activity, best suited to plan either early in the morning or during sunset so that humidity and heat is moderate and tolerable."
,,Great getaway from the bustling city,5.0,,"It's about slowing down your pace and take a look at the beautiful things around you. Best to go during evening/sunset time. I love taking photos around this area. From here, there are several places which you can continue to, the Southern Ridges or maybe the Hort Park for a beautiful flower tour. You can start your walk from here or you may also end your walk here. This is one of the few places in Singapore which I will spend time writing down review to recommend people to drop by this place."
,,Hair-raising Henderson,5.0,,"Henderson Waves is one of the attractions in the Southern Ridges. This is the highest pedestrian walkway in Singapore, at more than 30 meters high. If you are on top, try to go near the ledge and look down. Scary! But oh so beautiful sights. (Not recommend for people suffering from vertigo. But there is a solution, just walk straight for 300 meters without looking down.)

View is awesome! Tall buildings side-by-side facing north, and greenery by Singapore Strait facing south.

Take your family here and allot half a day in order for you to enjoy the other attractions at the Southern Ridge. Spend bonding moments with your kids at Mt. Faber Park and Telok Blangah Park, 2 areas connected by Henderson Waves. This is a great way to enjoy nature in Singapore. I encountered a couple of squirrels by the road on the way to the bridge. I heard you may even meet monkeys along the way.

Some tips:
- Don't forget to wear light comfortable shoes for walking a couple of kilometers.
- Transportation should not be a problem. Bus, taxi or car. I travelled by car and parked at a small lot right at tip of Faber Loop. Then, I walked a few hundred meters to the bridge."
,,Loved it!,5.0,,"A bit far out from the city but the bus stops right underneath it - climb those stairs but have water it was so hot when I did it and I nearly passed out! Views from the top are stunning and there are various nature trails you can do (which I didn't know about so didn't allow enough time). I did stop and read by book and got completely sunburnt on my face as the sun suddenly came out! Definitely worth a visit, spend longer there if you can, i spend just over an hour there!"
,,Jogging Pit Stop,4.0,,A great place to take a brief stop while jogging along The Southern Ridges. Nice view overlooking the Singapore port and the city from the opposite site. Try coming around sunset
,,Nature Lover,5.0,,"Located in between Henderson Road towards the Mount Faber, you'll find this bridge in the midst. Nice public seating and taking photos when the sun is down."
,,Interesting short walk path,3.0,,"It is just a part of long stretch of park walk path and this part is very short.
It is certainly interesting architecture but I wish they continue longer walk and give more shade and resting area along the path.
View is good from here but little one will have problem to see much."
,,Interesting,4.0,,Interesting walk with good views over skyline of parts of Singapore. Options for extended walks leading off. Well signposted and plenty of rest areas along the routes.
,,Go there during night time!,5.0,,The Bridge is way more impressive when its dark and the Illumination makes the Bridge Look Like a Giant Alien worm
,,Spectacular,4.0,,"Great place to relax and soak in what nature have to offer here in Singapore , views are breathtaking and can see a glimpse of the city skyline , wheelchair Friendly too ! Overall would go there again but next time at night for a different feel and vibes"
,,Waverlous,4.0,,"I like the design of the bridge and it was taller than what I had expected. On top of the bridge is where you can see a lot of scenic scenery or chill at provided resting spots. The bridge is connecting two parks, which are good for people who love trekking."
,,Refreshing,5.0,,"Get ready for a long walk. You would love walking through these ridges if you like exploring. I recommend late evening or early morning walk. For me, rather than the walk, it was the nature that was more interesting. The ridges run through thick vegetation and they have maintained it very well. Start walking and explore for yourself. You will not be disappointed.."
,,Special and famous hiking road,5.0,,"There are many people maybe saw ""Henderson Waves at night"" in magazine. I've been to see it from magazine. This time we were hiking there in the morning. This wave is very beautiful and we can walking, running in it. Due to this area doesn't have MRT so i recommend it can be take MRT to Harbour Front and hiking with other roads will make you happy and have lots of fun."
,,Interesting architecture,3.0,,"Nice walk over this unusual designed bridge. Some good views could probably be had on a clearer day, unfortunately it was raining hard so not much view or anywhere to shelter"
,,Clever construction,5.0,,This is one option for entrance to The Southern Ridges. To get here wither walk or bus from the Teloc B (something) train station but be prepared for lots of stairs to get to the wave level.
,,Good view but take the time for a walk,4.0,,"I went here as part of a tour, we were only given 10 minutes to quickly take a few photos which wasn’t long enough. If you go make sure you have time to walk through one of the parks that the bridge connects as the area around the bridge is one of the few unspoilt rainforests in Singapore."
,,nice,5.0,,good place to spend the day by walking or running or just sit down at the bench when the weather is good. Also a perfect place to date with boyfriend
,,Quiet and usual design,5.0,,"The bridge is an incredible design. Looks like ""waves"" (hence the name !) but actually on a slope. Not much shade as the design faces south. Not sure it is worth a special visit just for the bridge alone but a great sight on the Southern Ridges walk. Make sure you bring water as there is not much about."
,,Lovely Walk,4.0,,"A very beautiful place for a walk. We did a trail starting from Mount Faber Park (easily accessibly from Harbourfront MRT), made our way to Henderson Waves before descending at Telok Blangah Hill Park and taking a bus back to our hotel. The entire walk took us two hours (though it would be much shorter without stopping for photos) and we had a great time. Was not a difficult hike at all with well-paved walkways."
,,Family Walk,5.0,,Wonderful and amazing bridge structure that spans the forest and roadways below. Great views and very inspiring architecturs.
,,Amazing,5.0,,What a fantastic initiative to merge modern structures with nature. A must go for any nature lovers.
,,Amazing Wood Bridge,4.0,,"I came by from Marang Trail (Harbourfront MRT) around 6AM and climb up to Mount Faber. Rewarded by the beautiful sunrise like a full egg yolk.

Henderson bridge is a very artistic bridge, after a long walk visitor can take rest at the wooden bench. Dont forget to take some pictures coz its very Instagram-able"
,,Beautiful architecture,4.0,,"Singapore has plenty of run routes, and one of them takes you past the Henderson Waves, an interesting piece of architecture nestled in Mount Faber Park. When you reach the waves itself, you can take peak out into the sea and appreciate the view of Singapore's port, Sentosa, Keppel Island, etc. You can also see the uniquely shaped apartment buildings rising up from the ground like a beacon. Pretty stunning sight."
,,What a view!,4.0,,"It is really a nice place for pedestrians and with a lovely view. It is the highest pedestrian bridge in Singapore. There are two ways to reach the place - one by climbing steps or another by going by car upto car park and walking a sloped road up. The view is very nice. If you go in the evening, you can see the bridge lit up nicely."
,,Nice and cosy spot,5.0,,A good place for a evening stroll to sit and relax by the wood design bridge to watch the night light and feel the wind blowing by.
,,Keep Climbing,5.0,,"We came by bus and have to climb some serious stairs to reach the bridge, thereafter we are rewarded with the gorgeous sunset view. We can even make out Karimun, Indonesia in the horizon !

The bridge itself its an attraction, but you can only spend 30 mins and get bored, best is to wonder around the hills nearby for more attraction."
,,Simply Stunning,4.0,,Didn't expect such a lush & beautiful structure in the midst of Singapore's concrete jungle. We were there late evening to watch the sunset and the structure being lighted as the sun came down.
,,"Lovely bridge,great views!!",5.0,,"We visited this bridge on a tour, it is a lovely modern well built bridge with amazing view, well worth a walk over ."
,,A wow to me!,5.0,,"Had heard about it so many times, we decided to ride on train and bus to get to the waves. After ""climbing"" on a steep but easy stairs up to the hill, we finally got there while being sweating. The waves were so beautiful, such a wow to me. A lot of people was taking pictures on the bridge but it was not too crowded. Will be back there someday."
,,An amazing structure,5.0,,It is a very nice walk along the southern ridge in Singapore where the Henderson waves are a true highlight. I by far prefer this walk in the green with a sea view over the city centre
,,amazing,5.0,,"i like spent time in here.. i'm arrive at 5pm and leave at 7.30pm.. why i'm taking too much time in here? because once you get here, you can't take your foot away from this place.. amazing sunset and amazing lamp in the night"
,,Stunning Wooden Bridge,4.0,,"Henderson Waves is curiously shaped steel bridge with wooden footings that ranks as much as a huge public sculpture as it does a bridge.

Along its walkways you can catch stunning views of the tree tops of secondary rain forest and panoramic views of Singapore City, the harbor and the Southern Islands.

It is part of the 10 km long Southern Ridges green belt of parks, gardens and forests, and forms the final leg to Mount Faber Point."
,,What a view,5.0,,"I like mountains and forests, so this place is great. The curvy bridge is outstanding, even though there are some nice places to go nearby like terraced garden or the trails. The sky was a little overcast the day we came so it's pity that no clear sunset"
,,NIce trail stop,4.0,,"A nice wooden bridge that is more of a functional sculpture than simply a pedestrian overpass. Connects 2 trail parks so its a good resting place. I think it would be better to visit this area during early morning or late afternoon as it can get very hot! The bridge has some benches along the side but no sufficient shade. Should you be there by night time, colorful lights run along the entire bridge."
,,view,5.0,,Walking up in the tree tops is the view you have from this Wave walkway. the view out overlooking the sea nice. You experience the monkeys in this area and can get some playful pictures of them. Of course do not try to engage with them. They are wild and fun to see from a distance. The walk is long but the view is fun. Enjoy.
,,Good for a run,4.0,,Went here for a morning walk and also later for a bird watching trip. Nice place to see in itself once
,,Henderson Waves = Healthy Bridge,4.0,,"We already heard about this awesome bridge for a long time, one of the famous architecture design at Singapore.
We are going to Henderson Waves by Bus 131 from Vivo City (5 stop), and stopped at Henderson Road (below The Henderson Waves). We crossed the road and went up about 109 stairs, after that walk about 75m and we arrived at Henderson Waves.
This bridge real awesome, my suggestion just going to there at 18.00 o'clock (evening), and wait until sky is dark, and you will see this bridge so beautiful, because all the light is on.
For us this bridge also will make our body & heart health, because we must get a little exercise to reach it."
,,Nice place to rest after walking through Southern Ridges,4.0,,"If you hit the Southern Ridges from Mount Faber side, then you will reach Henderson Waves at the end of the walk and you will be delighted to just sit in here - right above the road and relax and maybe munch away some cookies. Do note that at evening, this becomes a top meeting spot for young teens so you wont get any space on it to relax."
,,Good hike for nature advanture lovers,3.0,,This is the most interesting part of the Southern Ridges with its specially designed overhead bridge architecture. Interesting and good hiking experience for nature lovers.
,,Nice place to visit in the morning,4.0,,"went here in the morning around 9am and seeing some people spend time here to do morning walk also. nice weather and nice area surrounding by lot of trees. if you want to go here by public transport, you can go to Harbour front MRT station then using Bus from Vivo city mall to the bus stop near here. it just take 5 minutes to using bus from Vivo city mall. then follow the direction from the bus stop to handerson bridge, it just walking distance."
,,Nice stop on the walk,4.0,,We stopped here in the early evening just after dark after a fairly lengthy walk along the southern ridges. The architecture is great and the angle of the wave is well thought out for relaxing. I was a little disappointed with the lighting as I thought this was meant to be a highlight and one of the reasons we came at night but just normal white lighting
,,Great Hike!,5.0,,"This is part of the 10km Southern Ridges hike. One of the highlights in fact. A nice place to take a break and have picnic in the midst of your walk.

Advise to either start at Hort Park and make your way up to Fort Canning through Henderson waves or the other way round. Very managable hike with great views (different as well) along the way!"
,,Disappointing,3.0,,Not particularly photogenic. Not worth going out of your way to go and see. A wooden footbridge across a valley. .
,,Interesting place for family & friends outing,5.0,,"We start from the Marang Trail which is opposite of Vivocity. You can either take a Circle Line or North East Line to Vivocity and cross opposite. As you climb the few flight of steps you are entering into a mini rainforest, very sereny and cool. Along the way we went up to Mount Faber and the views are beautiful, you see Sentosa and the cable car just across. Continue with the walk will lead you to this colourful staircase that lead you to a cafe with the entrance show Bell of Happiness. The cafe serve buffet dinner or if you just want to have a cold drink is a beautiful place to hang out with. Let continue the journey, you will pass Alkaff Mansion which consist of a few restaurants. Not far from it you will reach Henderson Wave, which you can have an awesome view too. Once you passed the bridge and walked down the steel bridge you could hear beautiful birds chipping. Is a beautiful place to relax and enjoy with your family and friends."
,,View,3.0,,"We go to Henderson Waves is rainy day, not optimal to explore that location. We go by bus no 131 from bras basah rd, only 25 min."
,,A wooden-decked wiggly bridge high above the ground!,5.0,,"The actual bridge walk is only 10 mins, but is part of the longer Southern Ridges walk, which can be done additionally, in increments, depending on how much you wish to do."
,,Paradise for Walkers,4.0,,Very well designed bridge and recommended for travellers who just want to walk and enjoy surroundings. Beautifully lit up in the evening & can see Sentosa from the bridge.
,,Good walk,4.0,,"Good activity for a long walk (from 4pm) on a warm afternoon , starting at labrador park and about 1-2hours later at the waves, and onward to Mt Faber for drinks at sunset at one of the bars there."
,,quite surroundings and peaceful walk,4.0,,"We started from harbor front MRT station. It is an ascend with lot of steps amidst the greens. As you go up, you reach mount faber (cable car station). As you walk further you will reach Henderson waves. it's a bridge, architecture of the same is conceptualized as waves. with curvilinear surface where people just sit, recline, relax, chit chat. and you can get amazing view of city and water front."
,,Very peaceful surroundings,5.0,,Great place to take a relaxing walk with a view. I prefer visiting at night as the city lights can be seen at night.
,,Neat little place,5.0,,"Nice place, you get a decent view of the bay area. I would go when it is not so hot,maybe sunset time."
,,Henderson waves. Nothing excepetional,3.0,,"Henderson wave to Fabre peak is an average experience
Reaching that place is not easy as there is no direct bus do you have to walk or take a cab which is surprising
Henderson wave is essentially a sky bridge over Henderson road uniquely done but that's about it. Walk to Fabre peak about 15 minutes and nothing great. Harbour with lot of ships actually is an eyesore
From Fabre peak harbour front MRT is good 15 minutes away
If you happen to come the other way be prepared for a tough climb from MRT to Fabre peak. Not advisable with kids and grown ups to attempt if decently fit."
,,Astonishing structure,5.0,,"The view that you get from the bridge may not be the best in Singapore, but the way it's designed does make it quite an awesome place. The bridge is nice and long for walks, there are places to sit and it's easy to get to. I visited it during the evening with the lights on and lightning flashing in the distance, amazing!"
,,Birdeye View,4.0,,"All happened today. Braving 30+ degrees heat to walk up the slope of Telok Blangah Hill to reach Henderson Wave. The bridge that links Telok Blangah Hill and Mount Faber.

From the bridge looking south will see the south harbour. Looking north will see Telok Blangah housing estate and the city skyline.

Many people doing different activities up there. Dog lovers walking their dogs.

Happy to have conquered it. Enjoyed."
,,"Beautiful view, fresh air",5.0,,"A long beautiful design bridge. I went there during the day a walked from the henderson waves bridge to the alexender road. The place is far from public transport, and I went there by taxi. It is worth to spend a few hours walking through the nature in the middle of the city. Nice place to enjoy the view both during the day and sunset."
,,Nice Night View,3.0,,Nice view of the Henderson Area. Relatively clean but the bridge itself (facade) is not very clean. Nice location to catch sunset and lightnings.
,,"Beautiful view, Nice air, Healthy Steps",5.0,,"Beautiful long Bridges, and the air is fresh up there.. can see some nice view from up there also.l lot of people jogging, and very nice to go with couple...."
,,Awesome view,4.0,,"The highest pedestrian bridge in Singapore is worth going to for the view of the city and harbour. Recommend timing your hike from HortPark or Kent Ridge Park to reach the Henderson Waves in the evening, where you can sit around and catch the sunset. After that, you can exit the Southern Ridges trail or continue to Faber Peak, to catch a cable car to Harbourfront, or hike downhill there to have dinner."
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,"If you are looking for a high place to watch the city's scenery then this is the place to go! The view is incredible! This place is perfect to a nice walk in the afternoon to watch the sunset.
You can get to it by MRT or bus. I've tried both and the bus seems to be faster and closer to the place."
,,A great walk and view.,5.0,,"Part of a longer walk, interesting walkway over busy highway made of timber and swirls and curves in front of you."
,,Romantic Bridge,4.0,,"The view from Herderson Waves is great and the design of the bridge is so cool. At night, the lights make the place more romantic. Great place for birthday surprise and proposal and moreover there is no entrance fee."
,,It's a Bridge,5.0,,"My expectations are low. It's a bridge with a cool design. If you live in Singapore then you should visit this someday. The bridge is unique and there's a pretty treetop view. The best way to get there is by car or taxi unless you enjoy hiking uphill a decent amount. Some people sit and take some time up there. For me, I pretty much just walk across it and think to myself ""That was ok to see""."
,,Nice Spot to Relax,4.0,,"This park famous with its unique infrastructure and design, wavy dome, that's maybe why they called Henderson Waves. I visited in the morning for running. Nice view to the city but also green because it's stated in the middle of the park and forest. Recommended place to work out definitely"
,,Worth the visit!,5.0,,"I think the Singapore government spends a lot of effort in making it's city look magnificent. This is one of the places. The wood structure as a bridge merges with the city landscape nicely. It connects with the Mount Faber Park and is designed beautifully. It overlook the city and is close to Sentosa and Universal Studios. Although I got off at the wrong stop, there is a bus station at the bottom of the bridge. It is very easy to get to if you have a car. There are parking right next to the bridge.
There are a lot of shaded sitting area, I think I could spend a whole afternoon pinicing and relaxing here. I see a variety of visitors, including families, couples, students, tourists...It is a place that I would come again to if I come to Singapore again."
,,Amazing Views at Night,4.0,,"We arrived just before dusk so we could see the bridge in the light and then see the views of the city at night. We then continued on to some of the other walks in the area, A nice evening stroll"
,,Worth the long trek through Mt.Faber.,5.0,,"Standing 118ft above Henderson road I could see below tiny buses and cars moving along the road. The green foliage of the forest and park area had shielded virtually every man made structure around, some of the tall buildings managed to show themselves though,maybe trying to still score a point for balance.
At this early hour on a weekday, a solitude walk with no one around within a five km radius was exhilarating. The bridge is designed uniquely resembling seven waves rising up and down the deck.
The bridge was made to connect Mt.Faber and Telok Blangah Hill Park a few years ago, the walk is about 1/2 a km and feels like a board walk.

It had started to drizzle a little and I started to walk towards the Mt.Faber park.
From here I could take in a panaromic view of the city, the dense CBD and a rainforest that was slowly opening up through the haze.
I must have spent about 3 hours of the morning and enjoyed the quiet, fresh air and the lush green environment."
,,Highest point in Singapore,4.0,,"Henderson Waves is known as the highest point in Singapore. It is a long bridge made of wooden planks. There are many people who likes to take a scroll or even run across this bridge to places like Hort Park, Mount Faber etc.
For couples, you can come here at night for a romantic scroll. There are many benches along the bridge hence, it is elderly-friendly."
,,Great outdoor activity for family,5.0,,"We went trekking at Telok Blangah Hill Park and also walked across the Henderson Waves Bridge and it was really cool as the kids enjoyed the outing. We managed to get a good view of the surroundings at the top.
The weather was good , not too hot and not raining, and It was a good exercise for everyone!

I think early morning or evening will be a good time to go as it won't be too hot."
,,Beautiful and a little scary,4.0,,If you are walking the fabulous southern Ridges you have to cross this bridge. Its very beautiful although not recommended if you are afraid of heights.
,,360 View,5.0,,"Early Morning visit recommended as it get really hot during the day. If visiting by Public Transport it is a good 30 minute walk from the nearest Metro Station. Awesome views, well worth the walk. Take water with you as there are no facilities around. You need a certain degree of fitness as there are a lot of step to climb."
,,unique design,4.0,,"Been mesmerized by the photos that people put on the internet and finally visited the bridge last March. We went there on Monday, so not too crowded. We were able to relax & enjoy the view without many people surround us, also able to take pictures as much as we want to. The sun wasn't that bright , humid indeed. We took taxi from Chinatown, cos we found that there are no MRT stations nearby the bridge.
Enjoy the view...do not forget to bring an umbrella / hat."
,,"Just amazing, visit evening",5.0,,Henderson Bridge is an architectural wonder. The best time is to visit during sunset. Once illuminated the bridge looks even more beautiful. Also a good place to walk around
,,Architecturally amazing!,4.0,,"Great place to just hang out with your loved ones. Family, friends well even a date in fact? I love it!"
,,amazing spiral bridge,5.0,,"singapore is a small country but a lot of place to visit. not only marina bay and sentosa. this place is just 5 bus stop from vivo city where the sentosa place is located. you can see the spiral infrastructure and the highest bridge in singapore.. you can do jogging,exercising, pictorial etc."
,,It rained while we was there.,4.0,,We went to this attraction and it poured down so we only spent a few minutes there. I would like to walk across it as it looked really nice place to go. You do not need lots of time.
,,Amazing construction,5.0,,From Vivo City can take bus 5 stops to reach here. Very nice design of the bridge. Group of friends can hang around and take nice pictures here.

,,unique wood wave bridges,5.0,,"Never seen the bridges like this, very beautiful and strong construct. we walk up the hill with silent forest along the way for about 15 minutes, but since we had 3 stops, take around 25 mnts to going up.
Romantic place, the bridges made from wood, best scenary in the middle.Sitable for tracking and jogging."
,,walking the waves...,5.0,,the highest walkway in Singapore. its about 38 mtrs above the road and 78 mtrs above sea level. the walkway connects Mount Faber to Telok Blangah Hill Park. its very near to faber peak. must visit when at faber peak. dont miss the lighting at the night.
,,Great views and fun for people watching,4.0,,"We live right next to the Henderson Waves, so we come here a lot. I love the design of the Henderson Waves, and come here often with a good book or my journal. I love resting on the wooden sides and watching people go by. It's also a great place for exercising, you can run up Mt. Faber, through the Henderson Waves and down the Southern Ridges, all the way to Kent Ridge, or the other way around. Also a great place for picnics with friends!"
,,Good Design,4.0,,This is a very good architectural design.A relaxing but tiring walk.A very good view and walk too hot during the day night is better.
,,great walk,5.0,,"Really enjoyed Henderson Waves, excellent viewing point & very relaxing walk from Mt.Faber. Recommend going early morning or very late afternoon to avoid the heat."
,,Astonishing trip done at night,5.0,,"I walked the southern ridge footpath at night and it was an experience !
Surrounded by silent forests or parks with low but secure lighting all along and city lights all around.
Reaching the waves ( a bridge over a valley) was sort of a climax to this walk."
,,Walk albino the southern ridge,4.0,,Awesome bridge and really nice walk. Could of done with a couple of the waves having more shelter from the sun though. So don't forget to wear a hat!!!!!
,,Nice outing spot,4.0,,"Can have a slow trekking up to the top of the wave, and enjoy the lovely view of the west side of Singapore. It can be quite hot and sticky, and remember to apply some mosquitos repellent beforehand."
,,This a View,5.0,,"After a hard uphill slog from the bus stop it was great to be able to relax and enjoy the many great views from this bridge.
A very clever design that we really liked. Then we continued on to Mount Faber to catch the cable gondola to Sentosa."
,,Great piece of architecture,4.0,,This is a place is located on the bridge where you can just relax after the trekking the mount faber. It would be a very place to visit during rains.
,,Nice relax bridge,4.0,,"It's meant to be a trekking morn so we start from the Hort Park, got stairs to up to the bridge that link to the Henderson waves. Depends on the speed u choose to, if more to strolling enjoy the scenery, may take 1hr to reach. When reach there, got the satisfy feel as on the tip of the forest & creative design by the waves look. Find a seat around middle to relax, enjoy the breeze & scenery. I unsure about the signboards that link to which parks but there are 3 parks that are connected to each other: Mount Faber, Telok Blangah Hill Park and the Kent Ridge Park. You can trek more to explore within the daylight. Sport outfits, sunscreen, mosquitos spray, cap & water bottles is advisable. Enjoy the trek~"
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"A great bridge with great views, if you are close by and have time do go check it out, very cleverly designed"
,,Great views,3.0,,"I incorporated Henderson Waves into my run from Hort Park - Mount Faber. Great views, not many people on the bridge. Will be continuing to use this route"
,,romantic and beautiful bridge with good view,5.0,,very awe beautiful bridge. will need to hike up or else take a taxi or take a bus to climb some stair to enjoy the wave bridge which is one of world top 10 bridge to see for a while or relax there
,,Night Visit,5.0,,"Getting to Henderson Waves is not easy. Taking a bus there would need the help of the bus driver so that you would alight at the right bus stop underneath the bridge, especially at night. The climb is relatively easy as there were stairs.

The bridge is beautiful and windy. You could just walk along it, view the city night scenery at both sides of the bridge, lie on the platforms of the waves, or simply take photos for remembrance.

I am so happy to be there as it has been my dream since the day I saw a photo of this bridge easily a year ago!"
,,Leisurely stroll,3.0,,Drove up Mt Faber and walk to Henderson Waves. Its a short leisurely stroll after breakfast. Recommend to walk in the mornings or evenings as air is cooler. The bridge is 3pm above Henderson Road which makes it the highest pedestrian bridge in Singapore. It connects Mt Faber ParkTelok Blangah Hill. Those more adventurous can continue with Hilltop & Forest Walk. Enjoy the bridge beautiful architecture. Some days you may meet bridal couples taking their outdoor shoots.
,,Relaxing,4.0,,Great place to go for a stroll and enjoy the scenery of our garden city. Best times to visit are in the mornings and evenings when it is windy and not too hot.
,,"Kelong restaurant Citra Utama, Batam",3.0,,Catching the evening sunset and enjoy the simple seafood at this kelong. Shell food are rather X. Choose the simple one. Work out to be $40.00. Give it a try reach there about 5.30pm to catch the sunset.
,,Back for more,4.0,,"I've now been here about 5 times in total and each time I still enjoy the experience. This time I passed through as a component of the longer Southern Ridges walk, but it was still interesting to stop here and admire the architecture of the bridge. Fairly easy to get to from Mt Faber, slightly more challenging from the Kent Ridge Park end."
,,Perfect for Photo-shoot!,4.0,,"Let the photo describe the perfect view! True to its name, the bridge mimics the undulating shape of a wave, curving and twisting along its entire 274-meter length at 36 meters above ground!"
,,Great bridge,3.0,,"Henderson Wave Bridge connects Mt.Faber Park and Telok Blangah Park. It is a unique bridge, though looks nicer in photo than the real bridge. However it was an awesome experience climbing up the stairs to reach this bridge.
We took MRT, alight at Redhill and take bus 145 but we lost in the middle as we cannot find the exact point to alight from the bus.
*We were supposed to alight before Telok Blangah Heights
Asking to some local and extra walking, we finally find the stairways to the waves! (Yeay)
Our track is from Henderson Road, this track is not recommended for elderly or little children with difficulty to climb stairs.
The overall park is very big and nice but at that time we were short of energy supply.
If I had another chance and better physical stamina, I wish I could explore the whole park."
,,"Fun, but very short!",4.0,,"My husband and I were under the impression that this footbridge went for several kilometers... it doesn't. It does take to you two other parts of hikes which can extend into several kilometers, but the Henderson Waves footbridge itself is only a quick 10-minute walk. Wear your walking shoes, shorts, and a tank top and get ready for a long hike if you continue through the other walking trails.

We recommend going at night to avoid the crowds and heat."
,,Scenic.,5.0,,"One of the standout features of the Southern Ridges. It is a leisurely walk, best experienced in the early morning or evening."
,,interesting bridge walk,4.0,,"We enjoyed a lovely walk along the bridge, it is a beautiful architectural wooden bridge with waves and curves from the top of the Mt Faber gardens. There are place along the way to sit in the shade and have a rest if you need too. we didn't see any monkeys(warning signs) but old ladies were feeding cats at the ends of the bridge."
,,Great views from the top,5.0,,"It was a great view after a hike from starting from the west sides of the parks. Nice area to relax and great view towards the Reflections @ Keppel Bay and the bay. If you are Danish, do not forget to stop by the Danish Church at Mt. Faber afterwards - it is the church that you can spot from the bridge. Great place."
,,Nice green retreat amidst the concrete jungle!,5.0,,"Awesome trail. very neat, and lots of wonderful views! Love the concept of the walkway above the trees . Loved the unique design of the walkway and the shelter areas. There were signs regarding Monkeys , but we did not see any. Our walk included the Forest Walk and Canopy Walk and it was a time well spent. It rained during our walk however that did not dampen our spirits and we enjoyed the entire trail."
,,Serene pedestrian bridge,4.0,,"Henderson Waves is the highest pedestrian bridge in Singapore, and it connects Mount Faber to the Hilltop Walk. Although the view on the bridge isn't anything special (just a street below), it is peaceful and a nice rest stop for hikers.

I wouldn't come to this area just to see Henderson Waves, but rather as part of a tour through the Southern Ridges (and bring your walking shoes).

There's a sign at the entrance warning about visitors about monkeys, but I didn't see any. There are, however, many cats on both ends of the bridge."
,,A trail in the city scape,5.0,,"Definitely an enjoyable 9km walk. Started from Harbour Front MRT station and spent about 3 hours walking. We reach Hort Park before noon. During the walk, we saw the city skyline and Sentosa from far. Great view!
Do start early to avoid the heat during noon time."
,,Nice views and walk,3.0,,"Nice views and walks but other than that I didn't think it was anything special but part of the Southern Ridges so if you are around, you might as well do it!"
,,Don't forget this chillout spot,4.0,,"It's easy to forget that this place exists. I only visit in the evening when it's cooler, but it looks like a great place to work out and jog as well, as part of the Southern Ridges route. The open-door vans with music blaring and people sitting on mini-stools are humorous additions to the car park, and it is a bit of a climb to the waves' structure. But the breeze blowing at treetop-height and the scene from there is pretty nice, at the end of the day."
,,Unique pedestrain bridge in Singapore which you should not miss,4.0,,"I and my 5 friends took a taxi from Marina Bay Sands hotel only 15 minutes to reach Mount Faber park. We enjoyed our walking along the highest bridge spanned at 274 metres. The curve shape is so attractive and uniqueness with 7 undulating ribs twist and turn through tropical foliage of Mount Faber park to Tolok Blangah. Thanks to the hospitality of Singaporean guys who volunteer to take many photos for us and advise us to act as flying on wave. It was so fun! We will come again to see the illuminative glow at night from 7pm onward. After 30 minutes walking on the bridge, we climb down the smooth stair to Henderson road to get bus no.145 to Habour front MRT. It is very convenient route. Please do not miss this bridge as it is - the talk in the town!"
,,Healthy walk for breathtaking view,5.0,,"When you need to take a break from the busy streets or pollution, taking a walk along the Henderson Waves can give you a healthy state a of mind. You get to sit with friends and enjoy the natural view of trees and the blue sky. Meet friendly strangers and other people who go there for healthy reasons."
,,"If you don't like crowds, this place is a must visit one!",4.0,,"From all the landmarks in Singapore, Henderson Wave is one of the place I obsessed the most. I love the atmosphere around. But don't forget to bring some water, since you need to climb lot of stairs to get there and there's no food court or something there.
You can enjoy Singapore view from above and that's awesome!"
,,Take a different route to get to Mount Faber,4.0,,"We took the MRT to the nearest station and walked to the bottom of the bridge, in hindsight we should have gone later in the day as it was very humid and its quite a climb up the stairs to get to the top of the bridge and it would have probably also been a better idea to just get a taxi to save your legs for the 'better part of the trip', - once up there the view is lovely, the bridge is quite unique in its architecture and it is a great way to get across to Mount Faber and or Vivo.
I have attache a Pic of a map which shows many other great nature walk."
,,photographic scenery,5.0,,It's one of the photographic attraction in Singapore. The view here during sunset or sunrise is also amazing. There's also a jogging / walking track near this bridge
,,Foot bridge over Henderson road,3.0,,"This bridge will take your attention for its artistic design.Try to visit at evening & non rainy day.Start from Telok Blanagh hill to cross this bridge to go to Mount Faber.if you are a nature lover, you will like to walk across it."
,,Good walk in the evening,4.0,,"We took a cab to the beginning of the walk - we were there about 7:45ish and the cab driver was wondering why we were going there so late! It was a good short walk and the lighting looked good in the evening, so did the skyline. If you are bored at home and want to go out for a bit and you live not very far, this can be a nice relaxing place to hang around."
,,Unexpectedly good,4.0,,"We went here by walking from Faber Peak, we just followed the signs and didn't expect the view and the bridge itself to be nice, should be nicer by night. It's refreshingly good to see the buildings and trees. If you have a lot of time, you can explore other trails going to somewhere. Below the bridge is a bus stop. We took a bus from here to VivoCity to catch the MRT."
,,68m above sea level,5.0,,A nice start or end of a beautiful walk through the Southern Ridges or a nice stopover on the way up to Mount Faber. As the views are for free: just enjoy :-)
,,great late afternoon jog,4.0,,this is an excellent jogging track with awesome jungle views. Its great for a late afternoon/ sunday jog
,,Great construction along Henderson Road & a greater view towards Sentosa,4.0,,"Growing up in the area, I'm now able to travel up and down this wonderful park connector that links Mt Faber to Telok Blangah Hill, aka Stream Garden or Mt Washington. A scenic place for Wedding Shoots as well as lover's walk! ... Not to be missed!"
,,Trekking at the Waves,5.0,,"Do some trekking at the Henderson Waves which resembles the undulating shape of a wave, curving and twisting along its entire 274-metre length. At 36 metres above ground, it is the highest pedestrian bridge in Singapore. It is illuminated to stunning effect by LED lighting from 7pm to 2am daily.
How to get there:
The best way to get there is via taxi since there is no MRT line in that area.
However, if you want to be adventurous, follow Google Map's suggestion.
From the Merlion Park, walk to your left, about 3 mins (180 meters) towards the OUE Bayfront Bus Stop
Take Bus 131
After 14 stops, alight at Aft Telok Blangah Hts Bus stop (better tell the bus captain that you are going to Henderson Bridge).
Walk towards the bridge.
Note: I don't advise that you visit Henderson Waves if you have children and/or older adults with you."
,,"Three big ""waves""",4.0,,"Connecting two forest parks (Mount Faber Park & Telok Blangah Park) across a road (Henderson Road) from above, this interesting bridge with the shape of three big waves on one side is something worth checking out although it may be a bit hard to find for a tourist as it is away from the MRT and all hustles & bustles of the city. In fact, the vicinity of the bridge (the areas ahead from both ends of the bridge and the area around the road below) is so green and luscious that you might even think you're not in Singapore (for sure, not in a typical ""urban jungle"" among highrises that Singapore is known for)! While taking in those green sceneries, you could also sit down ""inside the waves"" on the nice wooden benches kind of blended into the wave structures.

You could walk here from VivoCity (take the MRT to HarbourFront station which is at the bottom of VivoCity by the purple or yellow lines) by turning left on the road in front of VivoCity and walking until hitting the intersection with Henderson Rd, then by turning right onto Henderson until you see the bridge above with the steps to it on your right, the walk that will take 30 minutes or so. But if you're not sure finding it on your own, you might just want to take a taxi from in front of VivoCity; it will just be like a 5-minute ride which will just cost you a small amount. And conveniently for the way back, there's a bus stop right under the bridge (the stop is just by the steps to the bridge) to get back to across the street in front of VivoCity."
,,Apleasant walk only,2.0,,"Unique shaped of the bridge like waves. Apart from that, nothing. Was able to see some view of the city from this bridge."
,,Fun and tiring .,4.0,,I went to Henderson Waves with my classmates . It was a fun trip but also very tiring as we need to walk up the hill .
,,Review of Henderson Waves,4.0,,"You guys must be thinking I am freaking mad to go on a hill top walk on such stuffy and humid conditions on a school day. Actually it wasn’t that bad to begin with where there are lots trees and shades as we trek uphill. But the weather started to get VERY hot when we had to walk one big round to get back to our vehicle, even though that already seems to be the shortest path we could have taken.


Everytime we drove past this place, we could always see this bridge hanging in mid air. But it never comes across our minds on where it would lead to. Since we are bringing the dog out for her Sunday walk, we decided to explore the area, despite the very crazy weather !
We are standing right in the middle of the bridge and boy… the view is magnificent… I mean of course, compare to those famous hill tops in other countries, it’s peanuts.. but then, in an island of practically zero suburbs, here’s indeed something different.
And hey, I can see my house from the bridge !! Did you spot some yellowish color flats in the faraway background ? Yes, that’s the place where I usually hibernate myself. :)
pack of forest greens. Will it be gone one day to make way for the ever increasing population of land-scarce Singapore ? Sigh.
Take a closer look, did you see that Z like thingy in the picture ? That’s a super long flight of staircase that we will be attempting soon to get down."
,,Great Architecture,4.0,,Worth a visit to see the architecture. You can walk from one end of the bridge to the other. A short walk around the park area or a longer walk if you wish
,,Good place for a walk,4.0,,It is located in Southern Ridges Walk and connects one part to another above the road. Great place to walk and have a nice view. Lots of space to sit and relax as well.
,,Good walk in the morning,4.0,,A good walk in the morning to Mount Faber from here. However the beauty is spoiled by the rubbish thrown on the walkway though there are trash bins nearby. Singapore is a developed country but with a third world mentality
,,Quite a walk,4.0,,We walked from Harbourfront and accessd the bridge from Henderson Road steps. The bridge us a speculative structure. The walk is truely pleasant. We walked on to the forest trail which is an amazing tree to walk
,,Great views,5.0,,"We took the MRT to Telok Blangah, and walked over the bridge to the other side of the road, and walked to the lights followed the road left and kept walking past the bus stop, and kept walking until the crossroad and crossed over to other side of the road at this point we had walked about half and hour and the we were presented with the view,,,,, and what a view of the Henderson Waves. From this point there is a lot so steps to climb to get to the waves and the walk way, and it is not for the faint hearted, which I am, I only managed a quarter of the waves, and the walk way was brilliant, but as Im scared of heights, this was not for me, my other half loved every minute and he walked to the other side and back, he took some amazing pics and he said the views are brilliant, I was gutted but my fear took over.
There were lots of people walking around it, as there are many walk ways andround Mount faber from here, but we were on a time scale, also go visit at night, its lit up and is even more amazing!
Also look at the floor more, they give you pointers as to high from sea level you are!!"
,,Unique design ... Part of 12km walking trail,4.0,,"Nice design ... And part of a fabulous 12 km walking trail at the side of a hill in Singapore, called 'Southern Ridges' ... High in between the trees ... Along colonial houses Great day out in Singapore"
,,Nice place for Photographers and Nature lovers,4.0,,"This Bridge is definitly Built tastefully at good height with complete wood finished.
You can enjoy good natural breeze and loved the bright light which is a welcoming feature for photographers.
No need to walk much like for other bridges in Singapore. It can be reached with 1.5 km walk from the nearby busstop.
Thanks google maps for guiding me to reach there easily"
,,Uniquely shaped and nice views from atop,5.0,,"To get to this bridge, I took Harbourfront MRT (connected to VivoCity Mall) and then bus 145 (or you can use 131), which stops near the stairs to walk up to that bridge.

There were a couple of folks jogging and several taking photos on the bridge. The highest end is like 78 metres above sea level. The views are pretty."
,,Great structure and walk in Singapore,5.0,,Great feature along with South Ridges walk on the edge of Singapore. Magnificent structure with wonderful views worth the walk and visit across the Henderson Waves.
,,Unique design will make you pop your eyes out!,5.0,,Near to Universal Studio/Sentosa Island. Make sure you got the right time to go because it's really hot during midday!
,,Unique pic-nic to have,4.0,,"A very unique kind of bridge shaped like waves, high enough to view a lot of Singapore and the sea side as well.
All around it are parks in a foresty area, perfectly fit for a small trekking, some jogging, etc.

A lot of people have a pic-nic on the bridge as there is a division of benches below the ""waves"". It's a really cool area to relax and enjoy a nice view of the city/country."
,,Nice View and always Breezy,5.0,,"This bridge connects alkaff mansion hill to mount faber. It makes for a beautiful journey walking or jogging high up in the sky going through henderson valley.
The path itself feels great to walk on or jog on. It is kind of springy because of the wooden path.
It is a spectacular view during sunset 5 30 pm onwards... so ideally go during that time."
,,Wooden Bridge,4.0,,"wooden bridge is shaped like a wave, a very unique and a good time for to this place during the morning, afternoon and night, because if the day is too hot sunshine, this place is perfect for relaxing and jogging, we came in the morning, another time we will try at night because he was doing at night decorated with lights along the bridge"
,,A pleasant walk,5.0,,"A spectacular bridge walkway over the trees in Mt Faber park. Easily accessed from Mt Faber cable car station, well worth a visit"
,,A tree top walk with a stunning view and tranquility,5.0,,"Starting from the mrt station and uphill, will lead you to the famous Mt Faber with a good view of the busy singapore port"
,,lovely ambience,4.0,,"took the henderson wave route when walking up towards mount faber. love the design and the openness of the area. lots of space for ppl to sit down for a chit chat, or jus to enjoy the view.

lightings at night gives the place a very romantic feel, good for couples who wanna spend time walking n enjoying some night breeze."
,,Perfect scenery!,4.0,,"Went at night.
Can see many many stars!
Lots of space to just lie down and chill and chit chat.
When the wind blows, it's cool and nice.

A little inaccessible if you do not have a vehicle. But if you are prepared to walk from habourfront or mount Faber or telok blangah, it will be worth the trip."
,,Beautifully designed bridge,5.0,,Perfect for walk and view direction harbour or golf course... Pleasant for taking a little nap on many benches there :)
,,Treetop Walk,4.0,,See the greener side of Singapore with this tranquil walk through the treetops at the other end of the Henderson Waves bridge. This two kilometre walk takes you on to Alexander Road or you can continue your journey through Hort Park. Take time out from the hustle and bustle of central Singapore to enjoy this journey. You will not be disappointed.
,,Interesting idea of pedestrian bridge,4.0,,"That was the first time I saw a purposely designed pedestrian bridge. I think it was named ""waves"" because I could see and feel ""waves"" when I walked on it. The bridge was not as straight as the usual bridges; it was wavy horizontally and vertically. There were also lots of places to take photos of surrounding views and spots to rest for a while. The benches to sit were also made of the same material i.e. wood as the whole bridge flooring. The shading part was made of steel bars. There were quite lots of dustbins on the bridge, yet some people just did not bother to put their rubbish in them."
,,"Didn't expect much, but a really pleasant view",5.0,,We got dropped off at the beginning of the Forest Tour through the canopy and worked our way up to Mount Faber peak via the Henderson Wave bridge. It was a fabulous walk and wasn't too far from the peak down to the MRT at Harbour Front. However we stopped in at Vivo City for some food and to do a bit of shopping before heading home.
,,Tree top walk with a little bit of nature,4.0,,"A very beautiful walk on wooden flooring. For amatuer bird watchers who have little time, a great place to go. A super view of some Special buildings like "" The new condo building- reflections"""
,,Best view for running track,4.0,,Best experience of morning running I started from Labardor Station shortcut from Gillman Barracks to The Southern Ridges ran all long way to Henderson Waves and end at Telok Blangah Station for the entire 4.0 km. best view while running and nice architect!
,,Awesome design,5.0,,Brilliant design solution to spanning a busy road with this walkway through the park. Fascinating design and materials
,,“Good Hike With Views To Boot!”,4.0,,"The Henderson Waves is part of the Southern Ridges, which offer a good hike for those who want to be close to nature. It connects several parks in Western Singapore together, and walking from end to end will take about 3 hours.

The trial is suspended high above the roads at some points, which affords you a great view of Singapore's Southern Coastline and surrounding neighborhoods.

However, you need not traverse through the whole trial. Just start from any where in between and when you are tired, just go to the main road and get on public transport."
,,beautiful look,3.0,,"This bridge looks so cool with shapes such as golden waves. Henderson Waves is often used as a place to jogging or just walk or take a photo. In daylight, its regular sight, I suggest that you come from 7 pm. There are LED lights will be turned on and make the bridge more beautiful. Get the night view of singapore from 36 meter above street. Best for hangout."
,,National Park- See Singapore from the top,5.0,,"If you love walking, this place is the best place to see Singapore from the top. The bridge is fantastic.

Tips: Use casual or sporty outfit. Bring another cloth to change. Go to this place early in morning or during sunset.

Overall, it';s like other places in Singapore..Clean !"
,,Great design!,5.0,,I love the design thought out Singapore. They embrace the unusual and the visually stimulating. Henderson waves is an example of the Singapore design experience. Keep up the great work.
,,"Away from the ""city"" city.",5.0,,"The city is well-known to be crowded however to my surprise there wasn't much crowd at Henderson Waves (which makes it more awesome to be there). Spent a day at the bridge just chilling around. We also made our way towards the forest but did not manage to fully explore it. Nice architecture and concept, you could even picnic there if you wish. Only downside is that it is not covered hence it could be a tad too hot to chill there in the afternoon. Lucky the weather was just nice for us to chill as it rained in the morning. During sunset would be the best time to be there to experience Henderson Waves.
Be well informed that the restroom is pretty far down the route from the bridge.
There are many sections there to explore, you might/might not be able to cover the whole area within a day. Plan your trip well.
You could get there through the cable car (which connects to Mount Faber) or by bus. Alight at station Redhill and take bus 145. It's just 7 stops away and it stopped right under the bridge."
,,Walk & Relax enjoy your evening,5.0,,"Best to spend some quality time with your friends, family or your gf/bf during evening as you could view the yellow-orangie sunset and a refreshing walk through the woods."
,,A Wonderful Trip,3.0,,"Even if its a long and tiring walk,the place seems interesting and big. And also it has no shortcuts to go directly to the Henderson Bridge."
,,A good place to view Singapore skyline,4.0,,We went to the place with 26 students on a weekday afternoon. It was a good walk and the place was relatively safe for students to walk around on their own if they keep to the footpath.
,,Nice afternoon stroll,3.0,,the journey was very long and the weather was very hot but i had very fun day and its also has no shortcut to go directly to the Henderson bridge
,,Good for a visit with young children,4.0,,"We came here on Saturday with our 2 young children, one of whom still requires a pram. The bridge is easily accessible from Telok Blangah Hill Park, the entrance to which is on Telok Blangah Green, running off Henderson Rd. We walked up the path (no steps, so no problem with a pram) and onto the bridge and then onwards to Mt Faber Park. Quite impressive architecture with good views out towards Sentosa."
,,"""DO inform yourself of how you want to get there""",5.0,,"My adventure started w/ a recommendation for this place and, as I was out that way anyway, I gave the cab driver authorative instructions ""Take me to the beginning of the bridge"" (which meant the PATH TO the bridge apparently - which meant at a park, 2.5 km AWAY from the actual bridge, at the beginning of a trek, that pretty much climbed ALL the way UP THE HILL...) Regrettably, I came from a late lunch AND shopping, (=hands full) incredibly inappropriately dressed for the hike, (think: ""water bottle, sneakers and ready for a hike"" mode and you would be sooo much better off!!) and the muggy, humid, ""it is building up to rain"" feeling weather and you can see where this is heading... I would warmly (*pun intended) recommend this hike in running/hiking gear, joining the other ""Fit Fritz"" and really get the work-out out of this climb - the views ARE fantastic, the experience IS delightful, the myriad of paths and options should provide true exploration and the Henderson bridge is only a portion of the greatness this trail has to offer - There was a kiosk at the top (=closed) with a drink vending machine (=all sold out) which might have provided a relief from my by now perilously parched condition - the bridge lights were about to come on (people looked like they were waiting for it while doing - what: homework? Seemingly ""hogging the good spots...""?) but I HAD to get a drink so I stalwart carried on to the top at the other end - Mount Faber w/ the gondola station to Sentosa and subjected myself to rip-off prices replete with a gorgeous view and caught up with myself, life and the world and took a cab down!! - The hike SHOULD take 20 (perhaps 30 minutes) up to Henderson Waves bridge - I took much, much longer and would have stopped more often and chatted with you and pointed out things, perhaps even the alleged monkeys (""don't feed/don't approach"") and would have had an even more pleasant experience - because it WAS grand and I DO recommend you go, but dress appropriately, and know (or research) where you are going, and do bring a book, a good friend, a picnic perhaps and just chill out...
Provided here for your erudition and awareness by ""fools that went before you"" (but that slept REALLY well that night...)"
,,Nice afternoon stroll,5.0,,"Enjoyed my afternoon there. Sits/lay there as the wind breezes is just so tranquil in such rush city.

For some people, the way to henderson through mount faber might be a little tricky after a loooong way to get to mt faber itself, you have to go through stairs and jungle track. But its worthy!

Such a nice place for an afternoon stroll"
,,Good hangout place with friends,4.0,,great view and sometimes windy. Its open 24 hours and accessible from both Alexandra park and Mt Faber. nice place for an evening hangout with a bunch of friends.
,,Beautiful Views of Singapore from Henderson Bridge,4.0,,"We travelled out into the outer suburbs to the Henderson Waves Bridge – a beautifully constructed bridge that resembles sea waves. The bridge is 40metres above the road below and has a fantastic view to the Marina. Although heights are not a phobia of mine, you certainly get that nostalgic feeling of height as you walk across the wooden bridge.

This is a free attraction and the great thing about this part of the city is that the walk extends to a viewpoint across the whole city. It’s fairly easy to get to as we got the MBT to Telok Blangah and walked 10 minutes up Henderson Road. I would recommend taking a bottle of water as it gets very hot climbing the stairs up to the bridge.

It's a great way to see the city from up high and a peaceful escape from the city."
,,Forest in the city,4.0,,"I think this is a real natural in SG
Before go to the Henderson wave bridge you have to walk pass the park .I can' remember how long ,estimate 30min to the bridge?i remember only i 'm sweating too much(1 reason is the SG's weather is hot
The bridge is a modern architecture. I see a couple taking a wedding photograph here"
,,We can counting stars~~,5.0,,"It is used for connect two part of mount Faber park. As I know you have 3 options for get there.
1\ Taxi. This is how I got there, but it is better use navigation for guide the driver...The driver who took me there said that is the first time he drive there...My suggestion is if you only have interesting for this bridge but no idea for Mount Faber park, and you donot want walk too much,taxi is suitable for you
2\ Cable car. I know this can while I take cable car to Sentosa...actually cable car have two direction, one is to Sentosa, the other is Mount Faber...By this way you could take off cable car at Mount Faber station then walk to bridge, estimate 20-30 mins. You can also take taxi from station, but as i saw you need wait...
3\ All by feet. I saw many people running in this park, hope you enjoy: )
For me, the special of it is you can lie on the bridge, see the sky, counting stars. There are many couples lie there at night. Peaceful and romance.
Tip: I think you need to go earlier to get there, the night I went there already have no space for me to lie...wish you good luck: )"
,,An alternative nature walk...,4.0,,Captivating view of the skyline from the bridge and an early evening walk with your loved ones would be wonderful. Advisable to drive though carpark spaces are limited.
,,"See Singapore from another view, forest in the city",4.0,,"Went there in the evening, not so hot while enjoying the nice niteview and starlight. Surprisingly we saw meteor there. Forest in a city, should be nice if go there for hiking in daytime too."
,,Amazing views from this architecturally interesting walkway,5.0,,"This walk is on the Southern ridges and is the name of a bridge that was done architecturaly to resemble a wave. It is s pretty cool design and the views are amazing. you are above the city. I would highly reocmmend this walk along with the walk along the entire southern ridge. It is flat and a paved road so good for all, but bring lots of water and sun covering as it gets hot."
,,Windy view,4.0,,This is one of my top 10 Singapore spot for couples. If you come in the days your can actually look at the beautiful view overlooking the southern sea of singapore and if your come at night oy can lay down on the wooden platform and look at the night sky with your other half. and there is wind passing through the gay in the wood so its cooling while gazing at the starry night
,,Not that exciting...,3.0,,"Attractive bridge, but not really worth going out of your way for - unless your life just isn't that exciting! ;-)

To be fair, if you are used to city life and don't get out into the country much it might be for you, but if you are used to walking in the wilderness, then don't waste your time..."
,,Henderson Waves - Southern Ridges,4.0,,"We were a bit confused by this walk and from which direction to tackle it, but in the end it turned out to be very simple. We took a taxi to Hort Park, Hyderabad Rd - one of Singapore's newest parks and worth a quick look around. From there it is well sign posted over the pedestrian bridge (Alexandra Arches) and onto the elevated metal walkway. From here there is a gentle incline walk of approx 2km ending at Telok Blangah park. From there it is a short upward stepped path to the Henderson Waves, which is a wide foot bridge that spans Henderson Rd (36 metres above). Henderson waves was signposted as closed (until 31 Jan 2015) for painting, but we asked one of the workers and was waived through......it may have been lunchtime so they were not acutally working. Then we carried on to Mt Faber/Faber Point. We could have easily walked down to Vivo city to catch MRT or bus, but we opted instead to wait outside the Mt Faber cable car and take a taxi after it had dropped off other passengers. It was hot (1pm) so take plenty of water, although there are drinking fountains and nice toilets at Telok Blangah park. The whole walk took only an hour and was VERY easy. Our children are teens, but a robust 5 yr old could do this and you could probably get a buggy up the stepped parts easily enough. This is a nice short walk in the bush - and it's free! Definintey go. This walk would be equally good in the opposite direction (in fact it would be downhill) but I wonder about the ease of transport home at the Hort Park end."
,,Excellent Walk,5.0,,"The best way to see the Henderson Waves bridge is part of a walk starting at Hort Park, over the Alexandra Bridge, up the series of tree-top metal elevated walkways, then to the Henderson Bridge, Mt Faber, and down to Vivo City. I've tried to find my way from Vivo City in a previous trip, and it's much easier from the Hort Park direction. It's only about a $6 cab ride from Orchard to Hort Park (non rush hour of course). Then you can take the MRT back from Vivo City. Great way to walk off all that food from the Hawker Centers, and enjoy the outdoors. Make sure to bring some water. BTW, the view from street level of the Henderson (and Alexandra) bridge(s) are worth a couple of pictures too."
,,Lovely spot for pictures and mini hike,4.0,,"At first, we got quite confused on how to get there. We just read reviews from TA on directions and gave it a try. We took mrt and got off at vivo city. Then we stood by the bus stop at vivo city and just trying to find a bus heading/passing henderson road/telok blangah park/mount faber park. I think there are 3 busses heading that area.

The buss we rode drove pass under the henderson wave bdrige. Thus we got off soonest we can on the nearest bus stop and just wLk towards it. There Are stairs entering the park on each sides (either mount faber or telok blangah). U can just pick one.

Its lovely place for mini hike. With good weather and perfect outfit, i enjoyed it very much. Something different of singapore for me. If i know the parks were nice i would just do a lage afternoon run there. Recommended for family or travellers who got a bit ""enough"" of singapore malls."
,,Great looking,5.0,,Henderson Waves are just part of a walk you can take around/across Mount Faber. It is built from wood and looks very interesting. This part of the walk is not sheltered and it does get very hot when sun shines. A drink bottle is a must.
,,Will be closed in January 2015,4.0,,Nice bridge to cross over on your route over the southern ridges or Mnt Faber. It is not here that you have thr best views in my opinion. Due to work on the bridge it will be closed in January 2015. An alternative route is already signposted.
,,Uniquely designed bridge,4.0,,"An artistic high level pedestrian bridge with a curvy design in wood and metal, that links two hillsides. We crossed it whilst walking the Southern Ridges, and from on high there are great views of the surrounding countryside. Not sure what public transport goes close to it, but did notice buses passing on the road below. Although the bridge itself would appear 'wheelchair user' friendly, I'm not sure how easy it is to get a wheelchair up to the bridge in the first place."
,,MAGIC CARPERT RIDE,5.0,,"Henderson Waves is a 274-meter long pedestrian bridge. At 36 meters above Henderson Road, it is the highest pedestrian bridge in Singapore. It connects Mount Faber Park and Park, the Bridge has a wave-form made up of seven undulating curved steel ribs that alternately rise over and under its deck. The curved ribs form alcoves that function as shelters with seats within. The wave-forms are lit with LED lamps at night from 7 pm to 2 am daily. The Henderson Waves side is close to Mt Faber, which offers great views of the island. Alternatively, you can start from the other end and walk on the canopy trail and hill top walk, walking among the tropical secondary forest foliage and spotting birds along the way. Nice views and architecture. A pleasant way to get some exercise and escape the malls."
,,Beutiful Bridge,4.0,,"Beautiful bridge, take a walking from Vivo City or Harbour Front, enjoy the trekking...come here just for sightseeing, take photos, enjoy the walk. Better come here in the afternoon/ evening, the lamps make this bridge more beautiful. And its free charge :)"
,,Great Bridge To See,5.0,,"You have a see this from the bridge view (not from below) and when you are there take advantage to sit a bit and marvel at the design. You need to walk the Southern Ridges to reach this pedestrian bridge, but if you catch it from the cable car drop off area on Mt Faber, it is a short walk. Well worth it and not a bad stroll onto Hort Park from there with an interesting metal walkway that takes you through the forest."
,,Good Jogging Track,4.0,,"Another beutifull bridge that connect Mount Faber Park and Telok Blangah Hill Park. It's a reccomended jogging track, yet you can come here for just take a walk for sightseeing, take some photos, or just sarching for silence. You can reach this place by taking bus 131 or 145 from Harbourfront bus stop (front of Vivo City) and get off when you see the bridge crossing the road. You have to cross the road and climb steep stairs until you made it to the bridge."
,,Nothing much to do,4.0,,"Nothing much to do here. Just jogging, walking or simply sitting around. However this place is very nice place for photos hoots."
,,Good for photoshoots,4.0,,"Nothing much to do at this place. However if you love walking and relaxing in a sweet near place, then this place is highly recommended."
,,Nice place,4.0,,Nice place for strolling and for photo ops. Nothing much to do here unless u enjoy a day stroll and just looking around
,,Nice and neat,5.0,,This place is recommended for bonding moments among family and friends. Perfect place for strolling and picnic. If youre creative. Enough you can have a lot of nice photos here
,,Breather in the City,5.0,,"We took the Marang trail towards Henderson Waves during our recent short trip down south to Singapore. Very worthwhile hike and difficulty level was rather moderate. Reaching this beautiful piece of architecture and getting to step foot on it was amazing! The scary part was looking down at the public roads between the tiny gaps of wooden panel flooring at 77.88m above sea level.

All in all, it was a worthwhile hike for an amazing view!"
,,Secret Dating Spot,4.0,,"This bridge is located near vivo city, sentosa, mount fabour. Take a stroll across this amazing structure. At night, lots of love birds hang out there for some private time together in the breeze and quiteness. Enjoy the scene unfolds"
,,location is okay for me to make a love story,5.0,,"at the time of previous disclosures during Valentine's Day, I had the opportunity to visit Henderson waves, I bring video equipment and a guitar, after I met clients in the orchard road, I got to this place I come not alone, one of my friends whom I also. He helped me to record. I remember once when I performed various songs of romance, while in the surrounding streets also can meet various couples celebrating the day of love.

I still believe in myself, because I made a video for a very special person in my life. My expectation at the time was that other tourists may not give money to me because I am not looking for money for my actions, enough to make laugh.

I am very happy tourists there also understood my intention to do this action, I had to cut some of the action, but they are truly extraordinary, they do not pass what they like, they turn back to not interfere with my actions. wow very nice tourist over there!

warm regards

,,Just Okay,3.0,,"We just went one day to explore this place. We started from alexandra arch, opp. to Hort Park. The day we chose was too humid and in no time, we were soaked.
The hill top walk and the bridge itself are good for a walk/job but beyond that, there is nothing really to see there.
We walked upto the bridge but you can even drive up there."
,,Hidden Gem!,5.0,,"We came down here after we got off the cable car on Mount Faber and it was surprisingly a nice place to chill.
Good for a hike or jog, and then you can lay down or sit to enjoy the view.
One interesting place to visit if you look for a change from the malls and touristy places such as sentosa."
,,A different view of Singapore,4.0,,"Tired of shopping malls, air conditioned restaurants that's associated with Singapore? Go for a hike in a different part of Singapore. Collectively known as the Southern Ridges, we visited the waves on a weekend.

Started off from Marang trail, conveniently located by harbourfront MRT station, and to Faber Park, then Henderson Waves, architecturally, I like the wooden bridge and true to its name, waves.

It's a nice place to visit with friends and families and experience a different part of Singapore which honestly as a Singaporean, pretty fascinated by this place."
,,Nice place,4.0,,"Good place for jogging, picnic and jogging. Could be a good place to spend your weekdays for a quick strolling. Recommended to friends, families and tourists"
,,Worth a look,4.0,,Some of the reviews say it's just a bridge and this is true - but I do not know of another bridge quite like it. The structure is art work and something different. The views from the bridge are nothing to speak of but you can continue and walk to various parks. However I cannot comment on the parks as we had a taxi to the bridge and then a taxi back from the other side as in the humidity we cannot walk that far. I believe sometimes there may be a small kiosk open but this was closed when we was there but there was a drinks machine. There is however a cafe a short walk down on the trial but the car park.
,,Nice walk and breathtaking view!,4.0,,"Wow... Had a pleasant walk of 2.7 kms. We started our walk from alexandra arch through which we entered into a forest walk. It was a nice experience walking through the forest, and then we entered the Henderson waves. It was a long pedestrian bridge in singapore which was designed like waves. People can relax here and take a photos here. We can also have a view of Sentosa from here. Then we entered to Mount faber park which also has the Marina Deck, Palm Plaza, Jewel Box, and Faber Point."
,,A Great Breathtaking view!,5.0,,Another piece of art here in SIngapore. This place is beautiful surround by the park and I recommend this place for photo shoot with family and friends . Also a place to exercise and relaxing. You will enjoy the view of Sentosa from the bridge itself!
,,Beautiful view and relax walk,5.0,,"On our first trip, we parked our car at Vivocity and ended up walking a long way to Henderson Waves and with flights of stairs. It was a very tiring walk for us with young kids. 2nd trip, we parked at Tanjung Blangah Hill Park, it's was an easy 5 min walk. Very nice view from the bridge. We loves sitting down and enjoying the breeze and view there."
,,Nice view from above,4.0,,"Henderson bridge is beautiful wooden bridge and the shape is looked like waves. The view from above was beautiful. Its only 15 minutes walk from Mount Faber. I came here from MRT Redhill station using bus no. 145 and get down at bus stop Bef Telok Blangah (7 stops), the Henderson waves is above the bus stop. We can climb-up to the bridge using stair next to bus stop."
,,Nice view but nothing special,3.0,,do not expect an interessting trail way; everything is paved! only the very short waves are made of wood and offers a nice view towards sentosa island.
,,Some nice view from this beautiful wave,5.0,,The bridge is very nice and stylish. Great design and won the award. Many nice view / scenes from this place. Not too far from Mount Faber.
,,Not just a bridge...but also a statement that modernity can complement nature in a very beautiful way.,4.0,,"the setting, nestled near the famous Mt Faber, you can see the henderson waves. A bridge spanning over Henderson Rd. connecting Singapore's serene southern ridges. Great architecture, great view."
,,Great design and great views,5.0,,"Amazing wooden ""design"" bridge, which offers you great views. Make sure you have camera, hat and lots of water. This is one of the attractions in Southern Ridges, where you can spend whole day"
,,Very interesting design,4.0,,"Henderson Waves, Singapore's highest pedestrian bridge, in reality is more than just a bride. It's a work of art in a way and a great place to walk in the morning.
This bridge links Mount Faber Park to Telok Blangah Park crossing Henderson Road 36 meters above it. At one end it rises to almost 80 meters above sea level. The bridge itself is a wooden plank walkway attached to a wave shaped frame, hence the name. At regular intervals the height above sea level is etched into the wooden planks.
A good way to spend a morning is to go for a walk at Mount Faber Park, then cross the bridge to Telok Blangah Park.
Some people, I noticed come here with their cameras and telephoto lenses to photograph monkeys in the trees. The view from the bridge is very nice. In the middle, under a part of the waveform is a wooden sitting area in case you want to rest or just relax and take in the view.
There is a bus stop along Henderson Road just below the bridge on both sides of the road."
,,Architecture wonder,5.0,,"Amazing how the structure works. Standing on the bridge, we get nice city views. Take the bridge when you are exploring the southern ridges."
,,Just a bridge,3.0,,"I went specifically to view and cross the bridge. It was a nice hike and good views from above but it was just a bridge to me, nothing special. Again, this review is just for the bridge and not to the parks it connects.
Do take water with you because the snack shop on the bridge was closed when I went."
,,First Time Visit,4.0,,"I decided to check this out on my third visit to Singapore. I decided not to go here during the day because the temperature is unbearable for me. I believe the best time to go here is during sunset since it won't be too hot and you will still be able to appreciate the architecture of this bridge. However, because my friend and I took some time to get to this place, it was already dark when we arrived here. The night view of the city is a nice sight but I assume you won't be going here for that. There are lovebirds who were having their ""moments"" in here. Lol. Oh, there are CCTVs so you might have second thoughts if you plan to do something fishy. :P"
,,Wave fantastic,5.0,,"This is part of the Southern Ridges walk, an underlating walkway high above the treetops giving you wonderful views. Dont forget to take plenty of water and wear decent shoes."
,,Peeling and badly maintained but part of a great walk,2.0,,"Yes, as other reviewers have said, don't be fooled by the lovely photos,obviously taken when it was opened! It's nothing special and is in need of maintenance. The wood is stained and just.... old. Once on the bridge you have no idea of its form so it's simply a bridge. BUT........ it is part of a wonderful walk. I started at Hortpark and walked through the forest walk. No monkeys sadly and a downpour of rain but it's a beautiful way to see Singapore and have some idea of its layout. You pass through old military areas, black and white colonial houses and so much of Singapore's fabled verdure. I saw hardly another human being. Of course it was pouring but I suspect that this Southern Ridges walk is not yet well known. Do try it but beware..... at one point in the walk you have to descend onto a main road and continue the other side into Mnt Faber Park to get to the cable car. I thought I'd got lost and so settled for a great food court and market in a housing estate, Telok Blangha. Next time I'll be sure to complete the walk!"
,,The highest pedestrian bridge in Singapore,4.0,,"To visit the highest pedestrian bridge in Singapore, also called the Henderson Waves, take a train to the Clementi MRT station. Then walk to the bus interchange and take bus service number 166. This will bring you to Alexandra Road and you alight at the bus stop after Depot Road. Go up to the sky bridge and this will bring you to the Henderson Waves after you have walked about 200 m. The Henderson Waves has a wavy appearance and it connects Mt Faber with Telok Blangah Hill Park. The bridge is 274 m long and it stands at 36 m above ground level. On weekends you can see wedding couples coming here for their memorable wedding shoot for the album.
This bridge is brightly lit from 7.00 pm to 2.00 am daily."
,,Very cool bridge with nice view as part of Southern Ridges,4.0,,The Henderson waves is an interesting bridge with nice views as part of the Southern Ridges walk. People were setting up to take pix of birds and of a wedding party in the pretty setting.
,,Great bridge..,5.0,,"Went there for an architectural trip.. Starts from Alexandra Arch - Henderson Waves - Ends up shopping at vivo city.. It is cool that this bridge along with the forest walk, could take you to vivo city.. I'd never expect that this bridge could take us there.. But it takes about 1-5 - 2 hours, for the trip..but, i enjoyed it.. On the journey, you will find some great spot to take a nice photo.."
,,Bridge that Is Cooling,3.0,,Visited this bridge almost every month. the bridge make u see perfect sunset and also let u have a perfect date with your girlfriend. but one major down side is there is no shelter on the bridge. the places for people to lay back or sit is without roof. meaning if there is a rain you will have to look for shelter in the nearby parks.
,,Jogging Trek,4.0,,"I like to come here for jogging in the morning. From here we can jog until reach the forest and then connect to the Alexandra Bridge which will bring us to the Hort Park. So it's quit a long trek.
After reach the Hort Park, I usually take bust to go home to save my energy :)
What I admire about the Henderson Waves is, it's over great view in the morning. Thinking that how the government try to add value of it rather than just make a simple bridge, they build something to make it different. Even when walking in the forest, we don't have to step on the soil, but they made the path from steel so it's like a long long pavement to walk to make it comfort.
I really miss to jog there again."
,,Lovely trekking place,5.0,,"IMHO this is one lovely trekking place, although the route may be short compared to a real trekking site for professional. However it's a good place to relax and have some scenic green (of forest) and blue (of sky and sea). The architecture of the bridge is in the form of sea waves (hence its name) and it is interlinked with Mount Faber to Telok Blangah Park (so technically you can walk there)

Most often than not you'll find joggers and tourists here. Sometimes there're couples who come to take their pre-wedding photoshoot. I heard that the wave-form bridge is illuminated by LED light at night but I've never experienced it as I always reach there during daytime.

If you're not familiar with walking long distances it's advisable that you train (or at least warm up) before climbing uphill."
,,Beautiful Design,4.0,,Visited this bridge on last December in the morning. The weather at that time is very hot. I like the architecture for this bridge. It's unique and great for photos. Also it has a great view to the sea.
,,Don't be fooled by the nice pix,2.0,,"Walked all the way there after lunch at Faber Bistro as this was listed as one of the must see structures.....what a disappointment!
It was nothing more than a bridge with wooden planks and paint-peeled metal 'waves' shelters on one side. If witnessing a poorly maintained tourist attraction is on your must-do list, by all means, head on up!"
,,Waive the waves,3.0,,"After all, it is only a bridge. People make a big thing of bridges: Golden gate, Sydney Harbour, London Bridge, but the Henderson Waves?
Why people make a fuss of this bridge I really don’t know. It is a bridge. It connects Mt Faber to Telok Blangah Heights. It is a mildly interesting architectural oddity en route from Mt Faber to the Kent Ridge Gardens.
If it was to be of any real use, why not complete the shelters? They have carefully built some wavy forms and futuristic resting places, grottoes even, on the side of the bridge so that you can watch the sun set. Lovely. The sad thing is: when it rains you get wet.
Why did they not add a roof? They waived the need for naves in the waves. It is a pity about that."
,,Romantic picnic while watching sunset.,4.0,,There is not that much thing here apart from place to see panorama view and beautiful nature. Picnic on the bridge is a good idea. One thing I like when visiting here is that there are exercise spots for those who want to test flexibility or strength.
,,Excellent Walking trail,5.0,,I got onto the walking trail near Hort Park and walked to the Henderson Waves. A very nice elevated walking trail over some great lush tropical jungle. Heed the signs and watch out for wild monkeys. The Henderson Waves are well designed and nice to tour. GREAT views from here as well. Bring water if walking on hot or sunny days!!!!
,,Great walk,5.0,,"We were most impressed with this walkway - some of which is at quite a high level off the ground. Obviously, it is hot and humid (that's Singapore for you), and it is in the open so you need to be prepared for bad weather. We went up to Mt Faber on the cable car (great ride) and walked across westwards to Kent Ridge. Here, we continued our walk along Buona Vista to the Kent Ridge MRT. That was a bit strenuous - a taxi at Kent Ridge would have been more sensible. However, we thoroughly enjoyed our walk."
,,Curiosity satisfied..,4.0,,"Having seen pictures & read about the bridge, I'd put it it on my ""to do"" list & was glad to be able to strike it off my list during my recent visit to Singapore!

My friends & I set off (from The Jewel Box at Mount Faber) at 12-ish in the afternoon on the route headed towards the bridge. This route is quite shady with many beautiful tall trees but once we hit the bridge, it got quite hot as there no shaded areas along the length of the bridge. So, either come here at the early part of the day or in the evening when it's cooler or come armed with a hat/cap/umbrella & sunblock!

The bridge was a photo-taking treat. And, I can imagine if we had come during a cooler time of the day, it would be quite nice to sit & chill here. Apart from 2 (very hardworking) joggers, we pretty much had the entire bridge to ourselves.

One word of caution though, especially if you have height issues, don't look down! If taking photos from the side of the bridge, which is really makes a good shot as the bridge looks sort of like a dragon disappearing into the forest, look ahead, take your shot, don't look down! If you look down to the wooden floor, don't try & peek through the cracks. I knew that the bridge was supposed to be the highest pedestrian bridge in Singapore, but you don't realise just how high up you are till you look down! Having said that, being so high up, the view is fantastic!

So, despite being a little sunburned, the visit to the bridge was a worthwhile one. Perhaps I should return for another visit in the evening when the bridge is all lighted up?"
,,"Great photo op, quite the walk!",5.0,,We started out at the bottom of Mount Faber Park. Lot's of flights of stairs up through jungle type fauna and we headed towards Henderson Waves. What a great workout and great day! I would say this is a definitely great experience to get away from the hustle and bustle of Singapore.
,,Curiousity satisfied - not going back again.,3.0,,"I had only wanted to see the Waves and didn't care for the rest of the parks - found that bus #131 and #145 from Vivocity would get you closest to the Waves... once you climb the stairs from the bus stop on the opposite side and walk a little more once you're up, which is a tiring prospect after a long day out.

It's definitely too hot to go during the day, going in the evening might be a better option, as the lights on the bridge come on around 7 p.m.

It's touted as Singapore's highest pedestrian bridge, and the view is not too bad. Loads of people hanging out, having picnics, jogging, walking their pets... What they don't tell you is that you can still see through the planks and down to the street. But for me, once was enough - like Batu Caves, I'm not about to go back there again so soon."
